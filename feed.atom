Authored by Aden Tate via The Organic Prepper blog,


Yet another consequence of 2020 was the growth of public surveillance (aka Big Brother state) disguised under the umbrella of COVID. When you can convince a populace it is dangerous for them to be unobserved, you create the mindset that public surveillance is for the good of all.

As the mutant COVID-19 strain known as "Delta" picks up steam across Europe and the US, one of the WHO's leading doctors has just expressed concern about recent research published in the Lancet showing that the first generation of COVID-19 vaccines aren't as effective at protecting against "Delta".


Answering a question from a reporter during the organization's regular Monday briefing in Geneva, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said that there is data "showing a reduction in neutralization" for the Delta variant, but not as much as the "Beta" variant - better known as the mutant strain that was first discovered in South Africa.

Two professors at the University of Sheffield have published a piece in the Oxford Journal of Legal Studies to extend hate speech protections to animals to deal with hateful “speciesist” remarks. Drs. Josh Milburn and Alasdair Cochrane insist that such protections will help achieve a “more benign human–animal relations within society.”  The need for speech criminalization is based on the view that “some animals do seem to have their social confidence eroded because of their awareness of the risk of violence.”

The ongoing global semiconductor shortage is causing prices of electronics to rise while at the same time pressuring suppliers and material providers to continue raising prices. In the midst of the shortage, demand for consumer electronics has continued to rocket higher. 


Ergo, industry officials believe that the increases are likely to continue, according to a new Wall Street Journal report. The effects can be easily seen in consumer electronics. 


The report notes that items like one ASUS laptop that formerly cost $900 now costs $950. An HP Chromebook laptop that used to cost $220 has seen its price rise to $250. In fact, HP has raised consumer PC prices by 8% and prin…]]></summary>

In a letter dated June 11, the American Civil Rights Project (ACRP) noted that on Jan. 28, the general counsel of Coca-Cola demanded law firms seeking to keep the company as a client must commit that at least 30 percent of billed time would be from “diverse attorneys,” and at least half of that time would be from black attorneys.

Though it hasn't garnered nearly as much attention as the occupation of Lower Manhattan's Zuccotti Park, which was widely recognized as the genesis of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement that exploded in the years after the financial crisis, the occupation of Washington Square Park has shown no signs of slowing down, even with the Big Apple's crowded mayoral primary just one day away.


Some have even likened the park to a "no go zone", a reference to areas (typically outside the US) where high rates of violent crime prompt outsiders to avoid the area.

Last week, the Federal Reserve announced it will maintain an interest rate target of zero to 0.25 percent for the rest of 2021. The Fed said it will also continue its monthly purchase of 120 billion dollars of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.


Some Fed board members are forecasting a rate increase by late 2022 or 2023, though with the rate still not reaching one percent. 


The Fed will neither allow interest rates to rise to market levels nor reduce its purchase of Treasury securities. A significant increase in interest rates would make the government’s borrowing costs unsustainable.

The UK's vaccine watchdog is "closely monitoring" claims that 4K+ women have suffered period problems after receiving the COVID-19 jab. While side effects like sore arms, lethargy, soreness and muscle aches are included in warnings about potential drawbacks of receiving the vaccine, there are no warnings about period-related complications.


Nowhere are period irregularities listed as a potential side effect of vaccination, so British regulators are trying to determine whether there is actually a link between the complaints and the vaccines.

The Supreme Court has finally handed down two of the five “blockbuster” opinions of this term with rulings on the Affordable Care Act and religious rights.

California Gov.

The state is also weighing whether to extend the eviction moratorium for unpaid rent beyond June 30, a pandemic-related order which was supposed to be temporary, according to the Associated Press. Federal eviction protections are set to expire on the same date, however California's protections expanded the number of tenants covered by the moratorium.

Authored by Matthew Vadum via The Epoch Times,


The Supreme Court ruled unanimously this morning that the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s (NCAA) regulations that restrict benefits that may be given to student-athletes violate federal antitrust law.







The NCAA had argued that policing student-athlete pay helps to preserve the long-standing amateur status of college athletics. The high court was unmoved, rejecting the NCAA’s argument that it should enjoy antitrust immunity and affirmed a lower court’s order that will allow member schools to offer more education-related benefits to student-athletes.

In its latest Q&A assessment of the state of US fiscal policy, Goldman's economics team writes that while it "still looks broadly on track to meet our expectations, risks continue to tilt in the direction of a smaller spending boost and smaller tax hike than the roughly $3 trillion and $1.5 trillion over ten years that we expect." The bank then notes that "while a bipartisan deal on a broad infrastructure package cannot be ruled out, we continue to think the odds are against it, as there seems to be little agreement on financing it." Instead, Goldman expects Congress to pass a narrower infrastructure package focused mainly on transportation. If so, expect congressional Democrats to begin moving a broader fiscal pac…]]></summary>

Wednesday afternoon, there was a press conference. Some dots were moved about on a piece of paper and JPOW threatened a few basis points of yield in a year or two.

Sweden's centre-left Prime Minister Stefan Lofven was ousted in a no-confidence vote in parliament on Monday, plunging the country into deep political uncertainty. Lofven, 63, was the first Swedish prime minister to be ousted by a no-confidence motion put forward by the opposition in the European Union member state of about 10 million people.







Lofven, who as Reuters notes was defeated after nearly seven years in power over a plan to ease rent controls for new-build apartments, now has a week to resign and hand the speaker the job of finding a new government, or call a snap election.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Day: That Escalated Quickly

            
After having been forced to move Prime Day to the fall due to the pandemic in 2020, Amazon's annual shopping holiday is back to its original summer slot this year. Starting today, Monday, June 21, Prime members will have 48 hours to scour "more than 2 million deals" in order to save some money while spending it.







Originally conceived in 2015 to celebrate Amazon's 20th anniversary, Statista's Felix Richter notes that Prime Day has quickly evolved into a major shopping event, rivaling Black Friday and Cyber Monday. For Amazon, it has become a great vehicle to boost sales in the slower summer months, explaining why the event has been extended from 24 hours in 2015 and 2016, to 30 hours in 2017, 36 hours in 2018 and finally 48 hours since 2019.


As the following chart, based on estimates from Digital Commerce 360, shows, Prime Day sales have grown significantly over the years. In 2020, total merchandise volume, including first and third-party sales passed the $10 billion milestone for the first time, and there's little reason to doubt that 2021 will mark another record in terms of Prime Day sales. After all, the number of Prime members worldwide has grown from 150 million in January 2020 to more than 200 million in April 2021.





You will find more infographics at Statista


Amazon Prime Day deals are only available to members, creating an incentive for consumers to sign up for the program or stay onboard. Research has shown that Prime members outspend non-members by a significant margin, explaining why Amazon is putting so much effort into its membership program.

The markets reacted to last week’s Federal Reserve meeting as if the central bank was about to embark on a major monetary policy tightening spree. But as Peter Schiff discussed in his podcast, the Fed is all talk. It can’t possibly do what the markets think it might do. In effect, the central bank is running a “no stick” monetary policy. The Fed talking but it’s not carrying any kind of stick to back it up.





After the FOMC meeting, Chairman Jerome Powell did his best to set a dovish tone, even though the markets considered the messaging coming out of the central bank to be hawkish. But on Friday, St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard undid Powell’s damage control saying he sees the f…]]></summary>

Economic Evolution Turns Many Comparisons Obsolete


The financial system has entered uncharted waters and it would be wise to take nothing for granted. To assume the economy will move forward without a glitch in such an environment is  extremely optimistic. With time, things change and evolve, this transformation can be seen in both society and the economy. We are constantly bombarded with charts showing where things are going based on historical references but a question we must ask is just how relevant today's comparisons are with prior economic cycles?

Random selection is not generally an approach that most people opt for in the selection of doctors or even restaurants or a movie. However, it appears to be the new model for some in higher education. Former Barnard College mathematics professor Cathy O’Neil has written a column calling for “random selection” of all college graduates to guarantee racial diversity. It is ever so simple:



“Never mind optional standardized tests. If you show interest, your name goes in a big hat.” 



She is not the only one arguing for blind or random admissions.

Over 45,000 people have signed petitions calling to prevent Jeff Bezos from returning to earth next month, when the billionaire founder of Amazon.com is set to ride his phallic 'New Shepard' rocket into space along with his brother, Mark and an unidentified passenger who paid $28 million to join them.







"Billionaire's should not exist...on earth, or in space, but should they decide the latter they should stay there," reads one petition posted to change.org, which has received over 26,000 signatures as of this writing - many of whom let their feelings be known:







Another change.org petition with over 18,500 signatures reads: "Jeff Bezos is actually Lex Luthor, disguised as the supposed owner of a super successful online retail store. However, he's actually an evil overlord hellbent on global domination."


"Jeff has worked with the Epsteins and the Knights Templar, as well as the Free Masons to gain control over the whole world. He's also in bed with the flat earth deniers; it's the only way they'll allow him to leave the atmosphere," the petition continues.


Bezos just can't seem to catch a break these days.

Authored by Mark Glennon via Wirepoints.org,


Stories across Illinois and most of America now report furious parents standing up against what’s bundled under the term “Critical Race Theory,” or CRT, widely taught in K-12 schools.


Those who know what CRT is don’t like it. A new Economist/YouGov poll found opposition beating support by 58% to 38%. And opponents feel strongly. Those with “very unfavorable” views of CRT outnumber those with “very favorable” views” by 53% to 25%. Opposition is even more intense when specific tenets of CRT are polled.







What is CRT? Why the intense opposition? Does only the “right wing” oppose its teachings, as Gov. JB Pritzker claimed on Wednesday?

Can you imagine what it would be like to not have a home?  For many Americans, this is not something that they need to imagine because it is a daily reality.  Nobody knows for sure how many homeless individuals there are in this country, but recent estimates range from “fewer than 600,000 to more than 1.5 million people”, and everyone agrees that the number has been growing.  Even as the wealthy engage in wild bidding wars over the most desirable properties, more impoverished Americans are being forced into the streets with each passing day.  There has always been homelessness in America, but here in 2021 it is rapidly becoming a crisis of e…]]></summary>

Joe Biden wants reporters to stick to asking him about more simple matters like ice cream flavors. His last Wednesday "What the Hell?!" blow-up in Geneva in response to a pointed series of questions from CNN's Kaitlan Collins was but the latest in a recent history of his snapping at the press, which often involves him singling out and going after journalists personally. "What in the hell, what do you do all the time?" he shouted back at Collins while defiantly pointing his finger. He ended by telling the correspondent she's in the "wrong business".


Fox News noted this weekend following his attempted apology over the incident that "While Biden often praises journalists as highly intelligent – he did …]]></summary>

Canada’s plan for net-zero “greenhouse-gas emissions” by 2050 will come home to roost. Grandstanding has consequences, and in Bill C-12 we are witnessing the legislation to give it teeth. The demonized energy sector appears impotent to resist this attack and is outwardly embracing the idea, presumably to placate regulators and the woke mob.







Grandiose promises, for which the bills come over in decades, are a natural product of election-minded politicians. Their strategy is to garner positive press while leaving someone else to deal with the difficult task of making the promises happen, including paying for them.

More and more Americans are driving older cars. A new report found the average age of a vehicle on US highways hit a record high of 12.1 years in January. What this may suggest is a repair and maintenance boom is ahead. 


Bloomberg, citing new data from analytics firm IHS Markit, said the age of cars and light trucks increased by .20 years from 11.9 years in January 2020 to January 2021.

"There doesn't seem to be a loser here. New vehicles win. The aftermarket wins," said Todd Campau, IHS Markit's associate director of aftermarket solutions. "The older the vehicles are, the more opportunity there is that they are reaching the end of life, which feeds new vehicle buying."

The ultimate goal of every totalitarian system is to establish complete control over society and every individual within it in order to achieve ideological uniformity and eliminate any and all deviation from it. This goal can never be achieved, of course, but it is the raison d’être of all totalitarian systems, regardless of what forms they take and ideologies they espouse. You can dress totalitarianism up in Hugo Boss-designed Nazi uniforms, Mao suits, or medical-looking face masks, its core desire remains the same: to remake the world in its paranoid image … to replace reality with its own “reality.”

More and more, it seems like people have had enough with the critical race theory hoax. 


Most recently, parents of students at New York City's $57,000 per year Spence School are pushing back after students at the all-girls school were shown a video that mocked "entitled" and "annoying" white women.







The Upper East Side school is now dealing with a letter-writing campaign by parents demanding the school take a 'step backward' from its woke agenda, according to The Daily Mail.

As California’s population drops due to a mass exodus of residents escaping high taxes, exorbitant housing costs, and increasing homelessness, there’s another factor that’s been quietly contributing to the downturn: the declining birth rate.







Data shows that while the Golden State’s population continues to grow old, young adults are having fewer kids.


John Moorlach, a former state senator and Orange County supervisor, told The Epoch Times that the long-term impact of the state’s dropping birth rate is “hard to predict,” because the current administration’s border policy has made immigration numbers unclear.

The swarm of drones entering the kingdom's airspace reportedly spanned multiple hours, according to regional reports, which cited up to 17 drones intercepted by Saudi anti-air defenses. "The interception operations were successful," the Saudi military said, noting that many were destroyed prior to entering Saudi airspace while still over Yemen.

Renowned geopolitical and financial cycle expert Charles Nenner made a huge call at the end of January 2020.  Nenner said, “I am more worried about the market going down 40% than making 5% more on the upside.” 







The market topped a few weeks later (2% higher) and then plunged 38% for the next several weeks. 


Spot on call. 


Nenner also said he was “more worried about domestic civil unrest than war in a foreign land.”

In a move that can only be described as the pinnacle of embracing snowflake culture, the CBC has said this week it is going to close comments on all of its news links and video posts to Facebook pages to protect the mental health of its journalists.


Journalists - who used to be rugged and used to deal with varying opinions as part of the job description - are "fragile" and "in need of attention", like many other Canadians post-pandemic, the CBC wrote last week. Increasingly, they are facing "vitriol and harassment" for doing their jobs, the report notes.

Policymakers know they hold immense power to regulate and punish firms that don’t play ball. Industry leaders know this too. So it’s likely both sides will indeed end up “playing ball." 







The Democrats in Congress want comprehensive regulation of social media which will ultimately allow regime regulators to decide what is and what is not “disinformation.” This has become very clear as Congress has held a series of Congressional hearings designed to pressure tech leaders into doing even more to silence critics of the regime and its preferred center-left narratives.

He predicts that much of the sudden sharp rise we are seeing in input prices will indeed be transitory. And he presented a parade of econometric data that show many historical precedents why this is likely to be the case.

As expected when it comes to the Iran nuclear deal, newly sworn-in Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has picked up right where Netanyahu left off in warning the world against restoring the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Bennett in Sunday remarks for the first time commented on Iran's presidential election. In particular he seized on the Islamic hardliner credentials of the winner of Friday's election, Ebrahim Raisi, saying that world powers negotiating in Vienna must "wake up". 


"Raisi's election is, I would say, the last chance for world powers to wake up before returning to the nuclear agreement, and understand who they are doing business with," Bennett said.

Market Fails At Highs As Fed Spooks Markets


Last week, we reviewed our “buy signals” and the advance over the past month. As we concluded:



“While the market did hit all-time highs this week, it was a feeble rally. Such is not a sign of confidence the ‘highs’ will stick.”



Well, not only did the highs not stick, but the 50-dma failed during Friday’s sell-off. The market closing at its lows suggests we could see some more selling early next week. The “good news,” if you want to call it that, is that the “sell signal” is moving quickly through its cycle. Such suggests that selling pressure may remain limited and may resolve itself by the end of June.

This week, after a two day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released their statement.  Nothing material changed.  The Fed will continue to hold the federal funds rate near zero.  The Fed will also continue to create at least $120 billion per month from thin air to buy Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.

A driver slammed into spectators Saturday evening at the start of a Pride parade in South Florida, killing one man and seriously injuring six others (whose conditions are unknown).







Some witnesses said the crash appeared to be an intentional act. Spectator Christina Currie told the South Florida SunSentinel that she was with her family at the start of the parade.



“All of a sudden there was a loud revving of a truck and a crash through a fence,” Currie said.


“It was definitely an intentional act right across the lanes of traffic.”



But Fort Lauderdale Police Detective Ali Adamson told reporters that authorities were investigating all possibilities.

Three city blocks were systematically burned to the ground as hundreds of the local police stood by and viewed the violence. They were obeying orders not to harm the arsonists. The National Guard was called, adding more armed watchers. A passive gendarmerie consorting with open rebellion has rarely been seen in American history, until recently.


Except for variation in detail and numbers, this sort of thing is happening today.

It’s no secret that something strange is happening at the Fed.


Visitors to the New York Fed’s homepage are greeted, not with a description of the Fed’s important monetary and regulatory mandates, but an affirmation of the Fed’s commitment to economic justice.



“We are firm in the belief that economic equality is a critical component for social justice,” the banner reads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Colorado Home Dubbed "Slice Of Hell" Is Selling For $590k

            
A Colorado listing on Redfin has gone viral with more than half a million views since it was recently listed. The description in the listing calls the house a "slice of hell" after a departing tenant went ape shit during an eviction.


"Now it's every landlord's nightmare and needs someone with firm resolve to appreciate its potential. If you dream of owning your own little slice of hell and turning it into a piece of heaven, then look no further!" the listing said. 







Photos uploaded to Redfin for the property located at 4525 Churchill Ct, Colorado Springs, show widespread vandalism with spray-painted floors, walls, doors, and cabinets, along with hammer holes in the drywall. 












"There is not one surface of the home that has not been enhanced with black spray paint or a swinging hammer - damage done by an angry departing tenant who didn't want to pay rent. But don't let that slow you down. It's not nearly as daunting as the freezer in the basement that's full of meat and hasn't had electricity to it for over a year," the listing continued. 





The listing even warns prospective buyers to "wear your mask" before entering the home. 


At $590,000, the list price is about a 16% discount of what it could sell for if the house was in tip-top shape. 


According to The Denver Post, the price tag to fix the damages ranges between $150,000 to $230,000. This is the perfect fixer-upper for someone trying to buy a suburban house during one of the worst housing shortages. 


Meanwhile, millions of Americans face an eviction crisis in the coming months as pandemic safety nets expire.

Less than a month after a gunman opened fire and killed nine co-workers at a Bay Area rail hub, city leaders have implemented Big Brother’-style omniveillance to monitor firearm purchases at gun stores. 


According to Mercury News, the San Jose City Council voted unanimously to approve a new law that requires all gun stores to record firearm purchases on video. What's odd is that most gun stores already have surveillance cameras. However, the new law begins in September and will require shopowners to also record audio of all firearm and ammunition sales.

Carriers implemented general rate increases (GRIs) on June 1. Spot rates rose. They enacted more GRIs on Tuesday. Rates jumped again. Another wave of GRIs is set for July 1. Add fallout from China port congestion to the mix, and it’s a recipe for rates to keep climbing.

Authored by Matt Taibbi via TK News,


On December 8, 2020, when most of America was consumed with what The Guardian called Donald Trump’s “desperate, mendacious, frenzied and sometimes farcical” attempt to remain president, the Senate’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on the “Medical Response to Covid-19.” One of the witnesses, a pulmonologist named Dr. Pierre Kory, insisted he had great news.



“We have a solution to this crisis,” he said unequivocally.


“There is a drug that is proving to have a miraculous impact.”








Kory was referring to an FDA-approved medicine called ivermectin. A genuine wonder drug in other realms, ivermectin has all but eliminated parasitic diseases like river blindness and elephantiasis, helping discoverer Satoshi Ōmura win the Nobel Prize in 2015. As far as its uses in the pandemic went, however, research was still scant. Could it really be a magic Covid-19 bullet?


Kory had been trying to make such a case, but complained to the Senate that public efforts had been stifled, because “every time we mention ivermectin, we get put in Facebook jail.” A Catch-22 seemed to be ensnaring science. With the world desperate for news about an unprecedented disaster, Silicon Valley had essentially decided to disallow discussion of a potential solution — disallow calls for more research and more study — because not enough research and study had been done. Once, people weren’t allowed to take drugs before they got FDA approval. Now, they can’t talk about them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Small Step For Autonomy: Shenzhen Proposes Special License Plates For Self-Driving Vehicles

            
We're moving one step closer to autonomy in China...


Southern China city Shenzhen is on the verge of granting special license plates for self driving vehicles, which would mark the first such instance in China, according to Caixin.


It is a step that will help "promote commercialization of self-driving vehicles, such as their use as taxis, instead of being limited to tests," experts said. It's one small step toward widespread adoption, as autonomous vehicles aren't currently legal in the province. 


The proposed regulation will be sent for approval by the Standing Committee of Shenzhen People’s Congress at the end of June.







Xiao Jianxiong, founder of Shenzhen-based self-driving company Autox Technologies Inc., says the highlight of the regulation is the issuance of special license plates. 


If the regulation passes, the "Shenzhen government will issue a list of ICVs that can be sold, driven on roads and used for transportation business," the report says.


There's currently no national standards on self driving vehicles in China. Since Shenzhen is a special economic zone, it has more leeway to legislate than most other provinces in China. This would make it an obvious starting point for regulations that may wind up eventually spreading across the country - not unlike how California can often lead nationwide regulation in the U.S.


Xiao says that the number of self driving cabs could reach 50,000 by 2023 in China. So far, in Shenzhen, there are only a "few hundred" self-driving cabs.

The agreement may signal a rift between the NSA and the FBI, according to attorney Ty Clevenger.

A reported 3.9 magnitude earthquake off the Florida's east coast Friday was actually an "experimental explosion," the U.S. Navy confirmed.







ActionNewsJax.com reports that a spokesperson with the Navy said that what was measured were a result of military "shock trials" and they are not unusual, nor is it unusual for them to register as earthquakes.







Source


The United States Geological Survey measured the seismic event roughly 100 miles off the coast of Ponce Inlet.





Shock trials test the strength of a ship’s hull to see how it holds up in an undersea explosion (ensuring it can perform in battle).


This is not the first time such "trials" have been undertaken off the Florida. 







In July 2016, a reported 3.7-magnitutde earthquake was actually an 'experimental explosion' caused by the U.S. Navy, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

With the moratorium on student loan payments set to end with the summer, the American media is once again reckoning with the fact that the US has a hidden crisis with older borrowers weighed down by student debt. In many cases, these borrowers have been paying off student loans for decades.


At the very least, it's a depressing image of what might lie in store for millions of millennials, as individual student debt burdens have only grown more unmanageable as the cost of college accelerated beyond all control.







But with President Biden considering forgiving $10K per borrower, and the aggregate sum of delinquent student loan debt surpassing $435 billion (roughly one-third of the $1.7 trillio…]]></summary>

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday was assaulted as he visited a pizza parlor in Oakland.



“This morning, the Governor was approached by an aggressive individual. Members of the Governor’s security detail removed the Governor from the situation and the individual was arrested by CHP officers,” the California Highway Patrol, which helps protect the governor, said in a statement to news outlets.



The man hurled a water bottle at Newsom, who was in the area to tour several small businesses, local media reported.





Photographs showed the suspect, identified as Serge Emanuel Benoit Chaumette Jr., being arrested on Washington Street after the alleged assault.







The man was booked on assault of a public official and resisting an officer charges. He was being held on $35,000 bail.


A woman who identified herself as the suspect’s sister told The Associated Press that he is homeless and has severe mental issues.


She said the alleged crimes he committed were “consistent with his past behavior.”


Newsom appeared unharmed and joked with reporters that “different people have different ways of saying hello,” the East Bay Times reported.







Newsom was in Oakland to visit Beastmode Barbershop and Graffiti Pizza. The visit was meant to promote small businesses as they strive to recover from the harsh rules imposed by the governor during the COVID-19 pandemic.

One of California's most critical hydroelectric plants is at risk of closing for the first time in five decades as water levels continue to sink. 


A megadrought and scorching heat, both worsened by La Nina weather effects, have depleted some of the water supply at Northern California's Lake Oroville. The lake's current water levels are hoovering around 700 feet above sea level, but if 640 feet is breached, then officials "will likely be forced to close the Edward Hyatt Power Plant for the first time since it opened in 1967," California Energy Commission spokesperson Lindsay Buckley told CNN.

If contemporary American liberalism has any High Priests, foremost among them would have to be Jon Stewart. Arguably, he’s the functional equivalent of a supreme pontiff. So much of contemporary American liberalism hinges on aesthetic presentation — the ever-present need to convey that you and your peers “get it” — and Stewart pioneered the perfect public sensibility tailored to this ambition. For years, cultural liberals’ sense of savviness and ironic detachment, coupled with an underlying pretension to earnestness, was cultivated and affirmed by Stewart.

"The idea that we have held back security assistance to Ukraine is nonsense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shenzhen Airport Cancels Hundreds Of Flights Amid New COVID Cases

            
The southern coastal province of Guangdong appears to be the epicenter of new coronavirus cases as Shenzhen airport has canceled hundreds of flights and tightened entry controls. 


Shenzhen health officials said a restaurant employee at Shenzhen Baoan International Airport had been infected with the "Delta strain, a variant described as fast-spreading, with a high viral load and a short incubation period," according to South China Morning Post. 







The woman tested positive during a test for airport staff conducted Thursday, according to health officials. 


China on Friday reported 30 new infections, including six local transmissions in the southern province of Guangdong, where Shenzhen is located.


As we've noted, infections at neighboring Yantian International Container Terminal, a deepwater port in Shenzhen, about an hour east of the airport, has been operating at 40% capacity after a recent surge in infections. This has resulted in significant port congestion. The world's largest container line, Maersk, warned last week congestion at Yantian is worse than the shutdown of the Suez Canal in March.


Data from flight tracker VariFlight shows 400 inbound and outbound flights were canceled Friday. More are expected Saturday. 


Chen Bin, deputy director of Guangzhou's health commission, said there was still an elevated threat of a community outbreak. He warned against an easing of lockdown measures and said residents in locked-down areas would be tested regularly to prevent a spread. 


So if you were hoping the logistical nightmare in China would be over in the intermediate timeframe, think again. 


More than 60,000 factories are situated in Guangdong, and about a third of China's exports and one-third of the world's production of shoes, textiles, and toys move through airports and seaports in the region.

We are approaching a critical turning point in the history of financial systems.


Since the Great Financial Crisis, central banks have exerted control over the financial markets through their QE-programs and plan to extend their influence over the monetary system through the introduction of national digital currencies.  Opposing forces include, as usual, those of financial innovation, which include independent cryptocurrencies.


In the June issue of our Q-Review series, we will delve deep into the world of digital currencies and the future of monetary systems. To accompany our report, we intend to publish a series of blogs which examine the long history of monetary and financial systems.

Ten days ago, NASA's satellite spotted a massive dust storm blowing off the Sahara Desert and into the waters of the Atlantic Basin. At the time, we forecasted dust clouds were "headed for the Americas." 


Fast forward today, millions of tons of Sahara's nutrient-laden minerals have been whisked across the Atlantic Ocean and are set to arrive in South Florida on Friday or Saturday.


Satellite footage shows the airborne dust particles have already blanketed parts of the Caribbean.

What to expect in South Florida? 


Well, of course, dust can deteriorate air quality but also create milky, hazy colored skies. 


According to NOAA, "Sunsets and sunrises take on more yellow and reddish hues because the low-angle sunlight passes through more of the atmosphere before it reaches your eyes. A heavy load of dust in the atmosphere can enhance this effect, leading to longer-lasting, duskier colors that cause vivid sunsets and sunrises."







This latest storm comes one year after the largest dust storm in two decades blanketed the Caribbean and even dimmed skies over US Gulf states. 


Skywatchers are already reporting "some Saharan dust effect here in Florida this morning beautiful sunrise."

But just as President Joe Biden has ripped off many aspects of Trump's "America First" foreign policy and rhetoric, top officials in his administration have shown little compunction about hiring family members, despite Biden's promise that nepotism wouldn't be a feature of his administration.

Authored by Glenn Greenwald via greenwald.substack.com,


The axis of liberal media outlets and their allied activist groups — CNN, NBC News, The Washington Post, Media Matters — are in an angry uproar over a recent report questioning the foreknowledge and involvement of the FBI in the January 6 Capitol riot. As soon as that new report was published on Monday, a consensus instantly emerged in these liberal media precincts that this is an unhinged, ignorant and insane conspiracy theory that deserves no consideration.

After announcing last month that Chinese families would now be permitted to have up to three children, Chinese authorities are now planning to scrap all restrictions on birth rates in the coming years, with the new policy expected to be implemented first in China's most economically-troubled regions. According to WSJ, which broke the news in the US, senior CCP officials are discussing the possibility of doing away with these restrictions entirely by 2025, when the CCP's current five-year economic plan is slated to conclude.

As a candidate, Joe Biden’s number one promise was to “unite” America. Yet in his first months as president, his number one priority has been to divide our country by race and gender at every turn.







There is no clearer example than the Biden administration’s new effort aimed at indoctrinating America’s schoolchildren with some of the most toxic and anti-American theories ever conceived.


It is vital for Americans to understand what this initiative would do, what drives it and, most importantly, how we can stop it.

Flouting a warning from the Vatican and Pope Francis, whose liberal leanings have angered many Catholic conservatives, a conclave of American Roman Catholic bishops has voted to advance a new rule that would push priests to deny communion to President Biden and other Democrats over their support for abortion rights.


In a decision made public on Friday afternoon, American bishops voted to draft a statement on the sacrament of the Eucharist, capping three days of contentious debate at a virtual June meeting of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. The vote won with 73% in favor, to 24% opposed.

During the confirmation hearings of now Justice Amy Coney Barrett, I repeatedly objected to the clearly false narrative that she was nominated to vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act in the pending case of California v. Texas. The case was highly unlikely to result in such a decision and the Democrats knew it. The case was a focused on a highly technical and limited issues of severability. It would either be resolved on that limited basis or dismissed for standing. While Barrett might view the ACA as unconstitutional (as many do), I noted that she was more likely to dismiss the challenge or sever the individual mandate than to strike down the Act in the case.

Many of the over 350,000 workers Amazon hired in 2020 stayed with the company for just a couple of weeks. 



"Even before the pandemic, previously unreported data shows, Amazon lost about 3 percent of its hourly associates each week, meaning the turnover among its work force was roughly 150 percent a year.

In the last month and a half, China has launched the core capsule of the new Tiangong space station and supplies. On Thursday, three astronauts were catapulted into low Earth orbit and successfully docked with the new space station launched in April, according to Nikkei. 


The trio of astronauts - Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming, and Tang Hongbo - were transported in the Shenzhou-12 or "divine vessel" spacecraft on top of a Long March 2F at Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the country's northwestern Gobi Desert Thursday morning. By late afternoon local time, state broadcaster CCTV reported the craft had docked with the core capsule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pentagon Mulls Permanent Naval Task Force To Counter China

            
Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


According to a report from Politico, the Pentagon is considering creating a permanent naval task force for the Pacific region to confront and counter China, which has been identified as the Pentagon’s top priority.


Sources told Politico that the plan would include creating a named military operation for the Pacific that would allow the Pentagon to release more funding for Navy operations in the region.







The Politico report said the naval task force would be based on a Cold War-era NATO construct known as the Standing Naval Forces Atlantic (SNFA) that was established in 1968 and served as a permanent naval presence that would rapidly respond to a situation in the Atlantic. The SNFA usually consisted of a rotating force of about six to 10 ships from NATO countries that would sail around the region.


If the US established such a naval force for the Pacific, it would likely include Washington’s European allies and regional ones such as Japan and Australia.


The idea grew from a 100-day task force review of the Pentagon’s China policy that was led by Ely Ratner, a special advisor to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.


Ratner is a China hawk who came from the interventionist Center for a New American Security think tank. He was appointed to his position to appease China hawks who did not believe Austin had enough experience dealing with Asia.


Last week, Austin ordered the Pentagon to adopt initiatives recommended by the China task force review. Most of the recommendations are being kept classified, but Austin’s directive ordered the military to start acting like China is the top "threat" facing the US instead of just talking about it.


A US official told Defense One that the task force found a "say-do-gap" between what the Pentagon is saying about China and the action it is taking.

During Trump's first term, his administration pledged to construct a wall along the southern border, but only 450 miles of the new wall was completed by the end of his term.

The Federal Reserve continues to claim that the current run-up in consumer price inflation is "transitory," pushed higher due to base effects and a temporary burst in pent-up demand as the economy re-opens. Yet, that view is in direct conflict with policymakers' latest inflation forecast and the inflation data.

According to an update from McElligott, a massive ~35% of SPX options Gamma will drop-off tomorrow, 52% of QQQ, 61% of IWM and 54% of EEM.


These are staggering numbers and explains why we had a market-wide gamma meltup this morning, which however is set to end with a bang tomorrow when it all reverses.


...the poster-child in this latest iteration of the Equities 'Short Vol' movement - the 'Gamma Hammer' - was back both before-and-after the Fed and selling even more short-dated SPX strangles, which in-turn, back-filled the Street with more “Gamma” and created Equities to BUY into any pullback...

As Bishop Joseph Butler said in 1736, "probability is the very guide of life."


The coronavirus has generated more blind fear than perhaps any other event in recorded history.  That fear is blind because it ignores easily calculated probabilities.


The reported coronavirus deaths in the U.S. now stand at six hundred thousand.  The population of the U.S. is approximately 330 million.  When you divide deaths by the population, the number is less than two tenths of one percent.  As catastrophes go, that is a relatively small number.


There is a wide disparity of coronavirus deaths among age groups.

Puerto Rico's troubled power utility is attempting to overhaul its grid and is already off to a terrible start. 


More than 337,000 customers were plunged into darkness across the Caribbean island and unincorporated U.S. territory late Wednesday. Infuriating many customers after a cyberattack and major fire resulted in a massive outage last week. 


According to AP News, Luma Energy, a private company that is now managing the island's power transmission and distribution system, had "three units were knocked offline for reasons not immediately known."

Brokers booking freight on behalf of their customers say they have no choice but to pass through charges assessed by ocean carriers — charges that some shippers claim are unjustified.







That was one of the main takeaways from the only three public comments filed in response to an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) in April.

In the crypto world, Burke inspects the World Bank’s rejection of El Salvador’s request to use Bitcoin as legal tender, and Bennington updates viewers on the utter collapse of a stablecoin known as Titan. Farley and Burke also take a look at OnlyFans’ exploration to sell shares as well as the Bank of America’s fund managers survey, which shows that the majority of portfolio managers agree with the Federal Reserve that inflation will be transitory.

“Incredible demand,” inflation, and shareholder pressure on oil supermajors to drastically cut emissions could lead to an oil crisis within three years, with very high oil and gasoline prices, David Tawil, president of Maglan Capital, told Fox Business on Wednesday.







Tawil has been very bullish on oil for some time, and thinks that the prices could hit $100 per barrel soon.


In the near term, oil prices have more room to rise, both from inflationary standpoint but also from demand standpoint, he told Fox Business.


Oil prices are set to rise “consistently and considerably now into the end of the year,” Tawil said.

While it received far less attention that the Fed's dot plot, the only thing that the Fed actually did change yesterday were its administered rates, as it raised the rate on its overnight Reverse Repo facility from 0% to 0.05% and the rate on excess reserves (IOER) from 0.10% to 0.15%.







Since the RRP hike meant the GC rate would also have to increase, we noted last night that "with both market rates and RRP at .05%, there's really no economic incentive for cash investors to move cash to the Repo market."


Furthermore, now that the Fed is actually paying counterparties a modest but non-negligible 5bps on reserve deposits, it has made the RRP even more attractive compared to when …]]></summary>

The Federal Reserve continues to risk its credibility every month by anchoring interest rates near zero and purchasing $120 billion in bonds. The Fed's bond-buying program has created ample liquidity during the pandemic by keeping interest rates low, suppressing volatility across multiple asset classes, which has resulted in boom times for financial markets.  


As a result of the Fed's easy money policies, stocks are at record highs, and equity valuations are considered at nosebleed levels. This has created optimism for US initial public offerings - where companies have already raised $171 billion, eclipsing all of 2020 of $168 billion, according to a new report via Dealogic.

Via SchiffGold.com,


The Federal Reserve wrapped up its June meeting. While the central bank didn’t raise rates, the messaging coming out of the FOMC was widely viewed as hawkish. But was it really?







Peter Schiff doesn’t think so. In fact, he characterized the Fed’s messaging as extremely dovish. And the fact that it continues to ignore inflation doesn’t bode well for the future.


Most of the media attention focused on the fact that the Fed pushed up its projection for interest rate increases into 2023. But the Fed made no substantive policy changes. And it didn’t even indicate when it would reel in quantitative easing, although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did acknowledge that the committee discussed the ma…]]></summary>

US food banks in Republican states are preparing for a massive demand surge in food aid this summer as 24 GOP-led states are set to end federal unemployment assistance before they're set to expire on Sept. 6. 


The benefits set to lapse include the additional $300 weekly federal supplement and other Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programs that support low-income households. The policies have also contributed to a historic labor shortage after millions of people received more money via government benefits to staying at home than actually work. 


With local economies reopening up across the country, here are states that are pulling pandemic benefits early so that millions of people can reent…]]></summary>

Authored by Gary Galles via The American Institute for Economic Research,


Under the headline, “You May Be Paying a Higher Tax Rate than a Billionaire,” ProPublica is running the latest iteration of the left’s claim that “the rich” don’t pay their “fair share” of taxes, to help gin up support for raising their taxes. It compares (illegally obtained) tax returns for 25 top wealthy people with those for a supposedly “typical” worker with a wage income of $45,000, concluding that those rich paid a total tax rate of 16.0%, but the typical worker paid 19.3%.

The US military's vast supply chain is susceptible to theft. Thirty armor-piercing grenades went missing last year and were recently found behind a residential house. 


In 2017, rail freight company CSX Corp. hauled ammo shipping containers from Florida to Pennsylvania. Someone broke into the container along the line and stole one box of 40mm armor-piercing grenades used in a Mk 19 grenade launcher. 


The ammo box was eventually found in an Atlanta neighborhood months later, February 2018. Christopher Zachery told NPR News he found the box that read: "Cartridges for weapons." Inside were 30 armor-piercing grenades.

Authored by Kyle Ward via The Mises Institute,


Peter Schiff is a well-known critic of Bitcoin, and while he is an excellent resource on many economic and political topics, he misses the mark on cryptocurrency.


To be fair, he is right that Bitcoin and other crypto assets are high risk and volatile, and he correctly points out that using leverage or going into debt to buy Bitcoin could end in financial disaster. However, he makes several errors in his analysis of Bitcoin. 


He is wrong about its scarcity and its ability to hedge inflation, but his largest mistake is his guiding principle: that Bitcoin (unlike gold) has no fundamental value.







For example, Schiff is quick to point out that gold has uses…]]></summary>

Iran's presidential election which will see a new leader in office as Hassan Rouhani steps down due to term limits is once again pitting Islamic hardliners against centrists or "moderates". Rouhani himself has long represented the moderate faction, striking the 2015 nuclear deal with the West and currently seeking its restoration through the Vienna negotiations. But this chapter looks to imminently come to an end.


Iranians head to the polls on Friday, June 18, in a race that's boiling down between ultraconservative Ebrahim Raisi - currently the head of the judiciary - against his main rival Abdolnaser Hemmati, a centrist former head of of the Central Bank of Iran. A close ally of Ayatollah Kh…]]></summary>

More than four years have passed since Khan wrote her groundbreaking paper criticizing the present American anti-monopoly legal framework, arguing that policies and laws must change for the US to keep big tech from destroying jobs, cornering markets and hoovering up profits.

If Donald Trump decides to run for president again in 2024, there is little doubt that the GOP nomination is his for the taking. His support among the party faithful is so overwhelming that it is impossible to see anyone else winning primaries or caucuses. So, the question is whether or not he wants to run.  Like all good showmen, Trump understands that suspense holds the public’s attention, so don’t look for him to clear things up for us by offering a definite yes or now anytime soon. He knows that if he were to announce he is not running, there would be far less attention paid to him, and that is not Trump’s idea of a good thing.

On Monday, Dimensional Fund Advisors converted $29 billion in mutual funds into ETFs via Citigroup, one of Wall Street's biggest transfer agents, which served as the intermediary for the transaction. Now, executives in Citi's ETF business are babbling to Bloomberg about how the slow decline of the mutual fund industry (in favor of faster, cheaper ETFs) is about to kick into hyperdrive.

More than twenty years ago when I was a young Army intelligence officer fresh out of the academy, my commander summoned me to his office one afternoon because he had a ‘special mission’ for me.


I was beyond excited.


My assumption was that it would be a clandestine assignment to lead one of our unit’s counterintelligence teams in the Middle East. Or perhaps it would be temporary duty as an aide to the commanding general who would be visiting soon.


It was none of the above.


Instead, my commander looked at me and said, “Lieutenant, I need you to plan our unit’s long-term budget for the next ten years, and I want it on my desk this afternoon.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tropical Disturbance Could Pose Threat To US Gulf States 

            
We told readers earlier this week that the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is tracking three tropical disturbances. The most severe tropical threat at the moment is developing in the western Gulf of Mexico. 







NHC's 0800 ET update specifies the low-pressure area over the Bay of Campeche and southern Mexico will begin to move northward on Thursday. It could become a tropical depression by Friday over the western Gulf of Mexico.



"Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue over the Bay of Campeche and southern Mexico in association with a broad low pressure area. This system will move little today and tonight, and little if any development is expected during that time due to interaction with land. However, the broad disturbance should begin to move northward on Thursday, and a tropical depression is likely to form by late Thursday or on Friday when the low moves across the western Gulf of Mexico. Regardless of development, heavy rainfall will continue over portions of Central America and southern Mexico during the next several days. Heavy rains should also begin to affect portions of the northern Gulf Coast on Friday," NHC statement read. 



The system has a 90% chance of formation over the next five days. Computer forecast models aren't entirely sure on the track of the system but is likely to strike somewhere along the northern Gulf Coast. 







Readers may recall this hurricane season could be very active.


Refinitiv estimates around "17 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes are expected from June-November. This compares to historical averages of 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes, respectively."







The 2021 hurricane season could be off to a busy start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What Makes The Fed So Special

            
Just minutes before the FOMC announcement, Deutsche's Jim Reid notes that it’s interesting that we are debating whether the median dot will show the first hike slightly before the start of 2024 or after it. So we’re arguing over something that may or may not take place in plus or minus 30 months.


However as the chart from Reid shows, we have already tentatively started a global hiking cycle, so the Fed are looking set to be well behind the global cycle assuming it is sustained.







Which brings us to a key question from Reid which most have glossed over: "Given that the US has arguably seen the biggest monetary and fiscal stimulus of anywhere in the world over the last year or so and given the output gap will be closed over the next few quarters (it took until 2017 post-GFC), what makes the Fed so special that they can wait as long as they plan?"


As another DB strategist, Alan Ruskin, shows in a recent piece out of 45 countries the US stands out near the top of the global inflation charts across different criteria...







... something normally the exclusive domain of EM countries, a few of which have now started raising rates. The Fed will have no choice but to follow as soon as the idiotic "transitory" vs "permanent" narrative fades away.

He raised the issue of imprisoned Americans in Russia, including ability of US-funded Radio Free Europe to report freely. Biden also cited positive talks of "mutual interests" where we can cooperate, especially on strategic stability. There were detailed discussions steps to reduce unintended conflict, particularly nuclear arms control and reduction. Biden also says he brought up Ukraine and Belarus, and stre…]]></summary>

Ahead of tomorrow's FOMC decision, and in general, two clear camps are emerging when it comes to the increasingly acrimonious debate whether the current soaring inflation is "transitory" or not. In one camp we have the establishmentarians: those with little vision, limited imagination, and whose job precludes them from conceiving of any outcome but that accepted by the groupthink led by the Fed.

In interviews with media outlets like CNN and NPR Anderson’s theory is not challenged on the history and purpose of the Second Amendment.

The Israeli military said its aircraft attacked Hamas armed compounds in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday in response to 20 fires sparked by incendiary balloons launched earlier in the day from the territory into southern Israel.





At least one explosive balloon was reported over southern Israel, with residents reporting that they saw and heard the balloon explode in the air, according to Israeli media.


In a statement, the military said that it was "ready for all scenarios, including renewed fighting in the face of continued terrorist acts emanating from Gaza".

Israel's new prime minister, Naftali Bennett, had said in the past that the Israeli government should not tolerate incendiary balloons, and must retaliate as if Hamas had fired rockets into Israel.







The escalation came after an Israeli nationalist march, as part of "Jerusalem Day" in East Jerusalem that angered Palestinians.







 


Crowds waving blue and white Israeli flags set off from Damascus Gate, the main entry to the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, dancing and chanting "This is our home" and "Jerusalem is ours."







Iron Dome anti-missile defense units were also reinforced ahead of the march, amid threats by Hamas in recent days and weeks.


On Tuesday evening, Defense Minister Benny Gantz held a situation assessment with IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi, Shin Bet head Nadav Argaman, IDF Intelligence Directorate head Maj.-Gen. Tamir Heiman, IDF intelligence analysis chief Brig.-Gen. Amit Saar and Defense Ministry Policy and Political-Military Bureau head Zohar Palti.


Is the Egyptian-brokered cease-fire officially over?

It was 24 years ago this summer that Steve Jobs was coaxed back to Apple. The only thing was that investors weren’t interested. Titans of tech at the time like Michael Dell dismissed Apple’s long-term potential, and said the company’s assets should quite simply be sold off ahead of it folding altogether.


Apple nearly died, but for a $150 million investment care of Bill Gates.


Funnily enough Netflix opened its doors right around the time that Jobs returned to Apple. The reaction from investors was somewhat similar. The DVD-by-Mail company’s prospects were once so questionable that it tried twice to sell itself to Blockbuste…]]></summary>

Authored by Adam Andrzejewski via RealClearPolicy.com,


While the country fought a deadly pandemic for more than a year and schools remained closed, the education system in Pennsylvania received more federal aid than health care systems did.


The Keystone State collected more than $34 billion in federal aid, including through the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan Act, according to the think tank Commonwealth Foundation.







But the bulk of that money did not go to the Department of Health, Medicaid programs, assisted living and nursing homes, vaccine distribution, hospitals, and other healthcare providers.


Public education received 29% ($10.1 billion) of the aid, while 24% ($8.2 billion) went to healthcare.


The Pennsylvania-based think tank found that while nursing homes received $944 million in grants from the Covid-19 aid bills, the Philadelphia School District alone got $1.8 billion.


Students were learning remotely - from home - or in a hybrid of school/home learning for most, if not all, the school year. Why did schools get $10.1 billion in federal aid on top of their annual state and federal aid?


The health system in Pennsylvania and the rest of the country struggled, and in some cases, failed, to provide adequate care during the pandemic. They should get the bulk of the Covid-19 funding, not special interests, which shuttered schools and stunted students’ growth.

President Biden on Wednesday said he's feeling "very good" following the bilateral meeting with Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but both sides have remained tight lipped about what was actually discussed in the Monday meeting on the sidelines of the one-day NATO summit.


US-Turkey relations were already at a low point going into the meeting, particularly after the Biden administration's formal recognition of the Armenian Genocide. But when asked by a reporter about the meeting, Biden declined to divulge any details:

Ignoring long-term problems can work for a while, but eventually they catch up with you...







Over the years, I have written many articles about alarming long-term trends in our society that desperately needed to be addressed.  Of course the vast majority of those long-term trends never got much attention, because our political system tends to reward politicians that focus on short-term issues.  As a result, many of the long-term trends that I have written about previously have now gotten to a point where they have started to become very serious short-term problems.  In this article, I would like to sh…]]></summary>

As worries about the spread of deadly COVID variants prompts the UK to delay plans to reopen its economy, in the US, it's full steam ahead as more major states announced reopening measures on Tuesday, while the number of confirmed COVID deaths in the country topped 600K.


Daily US cases and deaths have fallen substantially as the percentage of the adult population that has been vaccinated has climbed. Now, with some states hitting their thresholds for herd immunity, they're loosening the yoke of repressive restrictions that were justified for more than a year because of COVID.

But, perhaps the most notable aspect of today's TIC data was that for the first time since April 2020, Foreigners sold US equities in April... (and that was the biggest net selling since August 2019 when we had the repo crisis and NOT QE)...







Additionally, the last twelve months' transactions in TSYs by foreign central banks just turned positive for the first time since Feb 2015...







Overall in April:




	
Foreign net buying of Treasuries at $49.6b

	

	

	
Foreign net selling of equities at $13.3b

The New York Times faced a stinging contradiction from Politico this week after it ran a story besmirching the lead prosecutor in the leak investigation launched under former Attorney General Bill Barr.


The article relies on anonymous sources to claim that Assistant U.S. Attorney Osmar Benevenuto of the District of New Jersey was brought in by Barr as part of his “small circle of trusted aides officials.” 


In reality, it appears that Benevenuto was not initially selected by Barr and does not appear to have known him.

Pink Floyd song writer Roger Waters slammed Mark Zuckerberg during a press conference recently, announcing that the Facebook owner had offered a “huge, huge amount of money” to use the iconic song Another Brick In The Wall Part II in an advert for Instagram.







Speaking at an event to raise awareness about imprisoned WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, Waters noted the deep deep irony of Facebook wanting to buy and use a song that rails against ‘thought control’ and mindless conformity.


Waters described the development as part of Zuckerberg’s “insidious movement… to take over absolutely everything.”

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


The Arizona legislature is ready to take action if the election audit taking place in the state’s largest county uncovers irregularities, a state senator said.



“It’ll be our duty to act in whatever way is appropriate,” Arizona Sen. Wendy Rogers, a Republican who has been closely tracking the audit in Maricopa County, told The Epoch Times.



Auditors, led by Florida-based Cyber Ninjas, started reviewing ballots from the 2020 election at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix last month, along with machines used in the contest and other election materials. Auditors expect to finish their work by the end of this month. They will then pr…]]></summary>

Authored by Michael Maharrey via SchiffGold.com,


The Federal Reserve is the engine that drives one of the biggest, most powerful governments in the history of the world.


Without the Fed, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the government to fund its foreign wars, its massive, unsustainable social programs, the ever-growing police state, and the tangled web of corporate welfare programs. It’s almost certain none of this would exist as we know it today – not even close. The federal government would truly be limited.


Although the Federal Reserve is relatively new within the scope of American history, its roots go back to the early days of the republic and the First Bank of the United States, chartered by Congres…]]></summary>

Viterbo University in Wisconsin has been the scene of protests for months over alleged hate crimes committed on campus.  The police however has charged a student, Victoria Unanka, with what it says was a hoax hate crime involving the setting of a fire in her dormitory. What interested me about the case was the curious combination of criminal charges. She is being charged with both arson and “the negligent handling of burning materials.”







The arson occurred during protests over alleged racial incidents on campus. A student complained about racial slurs directed against her. The university cancelled classes and campus-wide demonstrations were held.

However, in simultaneous remarks given during Biden's anticipated press conference, the president actually appeared to suggest nothing has really change. He said Ukraine has more it must do to meet the "criteria" for NATO membership. "It depends on whether they meet the criteria," Biden told reporters. "The fact is, they still have to clean up corruption... School’s out on that question."

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have published a study that reveals most of the perpetrators of mass shootings in America are people with undiagnosed psychiatric disorders.







The study focused on 115 assailants of shootings committed between 1982 and 2019, and then narrowed that number down to ones who survived.



“We found that most mass shooters in our study experienced undiagnosed and unmedicated psychiatric illness,” the researchers noted.



Describing the findings as “striking,” the study notes that symptoms of clinical psychiatric disorders were identified in almost all the shooters, 32 out of 35.

Bank of America's economists have been on a roll in the past four months.


Back in February, the bank looked at its credit and debit card spending data and concluded that consensus was far, far too low, predicting that the stimmy-fueled January retail sales print would be above 4.1%.







Not only was BofA's outlier forecast right, but the headline retail sales number came in even higher: at a whopping 5.3%, nearly 5x higher than the consensus estimate of a 1.1% rise.


One month later, when the Wall Street herd scrambled to make up for its clueless January forecast by being overly optimistic, Bank of America again took the contrarian approach, not because it wanted to but because that's what the data showed: spending on BofA …]]></summary>

During the full interview Putin dismissed the latest major accusations of mounting cyberattacks on US infrastructure as "farcical". "Where is the proof? It's becoming farcical," Putin questioned, adding, "We have been accused of all kinds of things, election interference, cyberattacks and so on and so forth, and not once, not one time, did they bother to produce any kind of evidence …]]></summary>

There has been a great deal of controversy over the graduation address of Fairfax County school board member Abrar Omeish to the Justice High School in Falls Church on June 7th.


In her remarks to the graduates, Omeish praised a teacher who made social activism part of her class and warned the graduates that they are going into a world filled with racism and white supremacy.


However, what really struck an admittedly libertarian chord with me was the third danger that she warned about: “excessive individualism.”

Nobody seems to notice the 'diminishing returns' on Fed manipulation, oops, I mean 'intervention'.







Perhaps it shouldn't surprise us that everything that will eventually matter is ignored until it does matter--but by then it's too late. Here's a short list to start the discussion:

The Federal Reserve has transformed the American populace into a nation of dismayingly over-confident gamblers. I've been writing about moral hazard--the separation of risk from consequence--since 2011.

Double Or Nothing


There’s lots to cover today, but let’s start with inflation. Friday’s Michigan consumer sentiment survey saw the headline rise to 86.4 from 82.9 because expectations jumped from 78.8 to 83.8, while current conditions fell; and 1-year ahead inflation expectations dropped from 4.6% back to 4.0%, and five-year inflation from 3.0% to 2.8%, even as the ‘good time to buy a house or car’ sub-indices collapsed due to the inflation being seen in those areas. Perhaps everyone surveyed closely tracks the lumber market, where prices are tumbling; or they instinctively grasp high prices destroy demand; in which case, everything is “transitory”.

Last week, when discussing the bizarre summer doldrums in the market which pushed the VIX to the lowest level since the onset of the covid pandemic, we said that this period of abnormal market quiet is likely to last until this Friday' quad-witch, when a massive amount of gamma and delta expire and are de-risked, in the process eliminating one of the natural downside stock buffers (see "4 Reasons Why The Market Doldrums End With Next Friday's Op-Ex").

Summary: With your meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Geneva just days away, mainstream media are barely reporting – and at times distorting – olive-branch remarks by Putin, and are at pains to "accentuate the negative". We are particularly concerned over the incessant media commentary on "Russian hacking", which seems to be aimed at mousetrapping you into an ill-advised confrontation with Putin. Revelations since the last summit in July 2018 – including testimony under oath to Congress – give President Putin some very high cards. Should things get acrimo…]]></summary>

The extreme consolidation within the container liner sector is the kind of thing owners of tankers and bulk carriers can only dream of. The latest data from Alphaliner highlights the extent of liner consolidation, how soon the rankings will change, and how newbuilding orders will render the carrier arena even more concentrated than it already is.







The top 10 carriers now operate 85% of global shipping capacity. Four groups — Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM and COSCO — control more than half of capacity (58%). The top seven, including Hapag-Lloyd, ONE and Evergreen, control 78%.

The Paradigm Shift


At a recent group dinner, I was asked to identify the most significant development in global macro I had witnessed during my three-year stint in New York. I expect that many people would point to the pandemic and the structural changes it has brought to the ways we work and live. But I think the bigger story is how the pandemic has triggered a paradigm shift in how corporate profits and wages will be distributed within national income. As this mega-trend reverses in the US, the tide will turn in favor of higher inflation and economic cycles will run hotter but shorter, in my view.

Authored by Ian Birrell via UnHerd (emphasis ours),


Just over a year ago, I stumbled across an intriguing scientific paper. It suggested the pandemic that was ripping around the world was “uniquely adapted to infect humans”; it was “not typical of a normal zoonotic infection” since it first appeared with “exceptional” ability to enter human cells. The author of the paper, Nikolai Petrovsky, was frank about the disease when we spoke back then, saying its adaptability was either “a remarkable coincidence or a sign of human intervention”. He even broke the scientific omertà by daring to admit that “no one can say a laboratory leak is not a possibility”.

Biden capped the G-7 summit with a victorious sounding "America is back at the table" - in what many are noting was an obvious swipe at former President Trump.

Though nothing seems to move fast in Israeli politics - after four national votes in two years and multiple failed attempts at forming a governing coalition - Israel's longest serving prime minister is finally out for good.


On Sunday Israel's parliament voted to approve the new coalition government under Naftali Bennet and Yair Lapid, with Bennet being sworn in as prime minister following the narrow 60-59 vote in Knesset. Netanyahu's 12-years in office comes to a close and he now faces criminal charges - no longer under the protection and legal immunity afforded by the PM's office - over prior corruption cases.

On April 5, 1933, under the pretext of a national emergency, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for U.S. citizens to own gold.


The decree forced Americans to sell their gold at an artificially low “official price.” If they refused, the government could hit them with stiff penalties: a $10,000 fine (equivalent to $205,000 today) and/or up to 10 years in prison.


The government blatantly stole wealth from the American people.

Since a Saturday1:30am mass shooting on Austin's crowded 6th street left 14 people wounded, at least two of them critically, there's been a manhunt underway for what police said were two suspects. A somewhat desperate and woefully understaffed Austin Police Department (given a prior year-long effort to "defund the police") urged the public for clues or cell phone videos which might reveal the gunman's (or possibly multiple shooters) identity. 


On Sunday late morning Austin PD have announced an arrest has been made of one of the suspects, though few details were given in the statement, which underscored that authorities are still seeking information.

Prices are rising on all types of goods and services across the US. Yet even with retail market participation at all-time highs, fee competition among asset managers and ETF sponsors - which has always been particularly fierce - is heating up once again. The biggest ETF providers like BlackRock and State Street already charge fractions of a penny on the dollar for some of the most popular ETFs (which enjoy AUMs in the hundreds of billions of dollars), so how much lower can the bar go?

Yes, really.


The remark was made by National Health Action Party’s Doctor Richard Taylor during a fiery interview hosted by Julia Hartley-Brewer on TalkRADIO.

Let's investigate the relationship between real interest rates and the price of gold.







Real means inflation adjusted. 


I calculated the real interest rate by subtracting year-over-year CPI from the current 3-month T-bill yield. 


One could also use the Fed Funds Rate or 1-month T-Bill rate as the yields are all about the same.

About two months after we discussed recreational vehicles are "on pace for a blowout year" and "sales just hit an all-time high," we got the latest confirmation from Thor Industries CEO Bob Martin. He spoke with Jim Cramer on "Mad Money" earlier this week about the manufacturer's massive order backlog. 







Thor Industries — Airstream, Heartland RV, Jayco, Livin Lite RV, and others — first began to experience an uptick in sales after lockdowns ended in May and June 2020. Without a vaccine, people were too afraid to fly or stay in hotels or resorts, so they bought campers and traveled. The RV industry also saw a lot of first-time buyers, especially with the millennial generation.

Is inflation rising?


The consumer price index (CPI), an index used as a proxy for inflation in consumer prices, offers some answers. In 2020, inflation dropped to 1.4%, the lowest rate since 2015. By comparison, inflation sits around 5.0% as of June 2021.







Given how the economic shock of COVID-19 depressed prices, rising price levels make sense. However, as Visual Capitalist's Dorothy Neufeld notes, other variables, such as a growing money supply and rising raw materials costs, could factor into rising inflation.


To show current price levels in context, this Markets in a Minute chart from New York Life Investments shows the history of inflation over 100 years.

Last year there was a proposal circulating in the Seattle City Council to consider making drug abuse and mental disorders a defense against most misdemeanor crimes. In essence, that would have been a green light for an army of homeless shoplifters to steal at will knowing they’d face no chance of being punished. But it appears Seattle police have decided to do something about aggressive shoplifters. This Wednesday they arrested 53 shoplifters in 9 separate stores:

CJNG released a video of their "Grupo Elite" otherwise known as special forces team, "outfitted with signal jammers and heavily modified rifles," said atlas.news. The video also shows the unit in what appears to be a bulletproof vehicle. 


CJNG released the video (watch here) on the prospects of expanding their control into Naucalpan de Juárez, a city located just northwest of Mexico City in the neighboring State of Mexico. They appear to be threatening local drug lord Nestor Arturo Lopez Arellano, otherwise known as "El 20."

While Tesla's Cybertruck was revealed far in advance of Ford's F-150 Lightning electric pickup, the Lightning has several things going for it.


First, it actually appears to exist, and is planned to roll off the assembly line in Spring 2022 - unlike the Cybertruck, the current status of which is up in the air. Second, the Ford F-150 Lightning now has 100,000 reservations in just the 3 short weeks since its introduction. 


Emma Bergg, Ford spokeswoman, told the Detroit Free Press on Thursday: "We're super excited about the demand. Reservations are getting added all the time."


 





The Lightning was released 3 weeks ago and packs 563 horsepower and 775 lb.-ft. of torque. In the first 48 hours after its release, the company received 44,500 pre-orders. President Biden was at the truck's release last month and even gave the Lightning a test drive and some free press. "This sucker is quick," Biden said, after taking off in the truck on a closed course. 


By comparison, since 2019, Tesla's Cybertruck has accumulated over 1 million reservations. 


Tesla's official website doesn't denote an expected delivery date. As of May, it was expected that the Cybertruck would begin production in "late 2021". 


Ford, meanwhile, is taking $100 refundable deposits for the Lightning and the truck starts at $39,974.

Gold prices hit an all-time high of $2,069 per ounce on August 6, 2020.

This weekend, the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) closed down multiple city streets around the Inner Harbor, in a stretch called "Fells Point," after dozens of local businesses threatened the new city government, run by Mayor Brandon Scott, to not pay taxes because they're "fed up and frustrated" with the outburst of violence. 


Last week, 37 restaurants and small businesses sent a letter to the mayor's office titled "Letter to City Leaders From Fells Point Business Leaders." They threatened to stop paying city taxes and other fees until "basic and essential municipal services are restored."

Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday called on the US and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals during the UN-backed Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.


While Washington is constantly hyping up China’s nuclear arsenal, it is only a fraction of what the US and Russia possess. Estimates on the higher-end put China’s nuclear stockpile at 350 warheads. Russia has about 6,350 warheads, while the US has 5,800.







Despite the numbers, the US complains that Beijing does not want to enter arms control talks. But China has no motivation to do so unless the US and Russia make an effort to reduce their arsenals. Regardless, the US continues to blame the issue on China.


"To date, China has rebuffed US efforts to initiate bilateral talks on risk reduction and strategic stability," Robert Wood, the US ambassador for disarmament, said at the conference.


Besides having way more nuclear weapons than Beijing, the US is also encircling China with military hardware. The US has plans to deploy medium-range missiles near China that were previously banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the US withdrew from in 2019.







Wang took a shot at the US for its plans to further militarize Asia which he characterized as undermining regional stability.


"China opposes the development and deployment of regional and global missile defense systems by a certain country that undermine strategic stability, and China opposes the deployment of land-based intermediate-range ballistic missiles by the same country in the neighborhood of other countries," he said.

Pakistan is expected to spend more than a billion dollars in the next fiscal year to import COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate around 100 million people. The trouble is, anti-vaccine groups have sprung up around the country and have deterred some from taking the vaccine. In response, one local government in Pakistan has a new weapon in its war chest against vaccine hesitancy: disable the SIM cards of mobile phones of people who decline to get jabbed, according to RT News. 


Punjab Health Minister Yasmin Rashid decided on Thursday during a meeting with the Punjab provincial government and military officials that anyone who denied the COVID-19 jab will have their SIM cards disabled at "a certain time."

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


The Fed's god-like powers will be revealed for what they really are: artifice and illusion.


The Fed will be proven catastrophically wrong about inflation for the simple reason that inflation isn't transitory, it's sticky: when prices rise due to real-world scarcities and higher costs, they stay high and then move higher as expectations catch up with reality.


Consider the dynamic of Fed-inflated bubbles raising rents. The house that once sold for $200,000 is sold to a pool of investors for $800,000, and the property taxes, insurance and debt service rise accordingly: even though the house didn't change, thanks to the Fed's bubble, the entire cost structure is higher.

Russian President Vladimir Putin this week sat down for an interview with a US media outlet for the first time in nearly three years. NBC's Keir Simmons talked to Putin for about 90 minutes, and released a teaser segment Friday night. 


Perhaps the most interesting part of the conversation centered on the Russian leader's perspective on American politics and his personal thoughts and comparison of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Putin called the former president "extraordinary" and "talented" while noting that Biden is "radically different" and is a quintessential "career man" in politics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One Shocking Chart That Has Farmers Trembling With Fear 

            
Readers know by now that the Western US is facing one of the most severe droughts in years. We've documented (read here & here) this spring of a "megadrought" sweeping across states like California and Nevada as risks of a second Dust Bowl increase by the day. 


But in this note, let's dive deeper into the drought and how it's impacting farmers and the potential consequences it could have on crops. Meteorologists at BAMWX have published data on surface soil moisture over 20 years. Surface soil moisture is the water that is in the upper 4 inches and available for various types of plants. They found that the 2021 moisture deficit for early June is the worst it has ever been in two decades. 







BAMWX's Vince Bryan says the moisture deficit in the soil is "a concern" as it may impact plant development. Soil moisture plays a crucial role in agricultural monitoring, drought and flood forecasting, forest fire prediction, and water supply management. 


Soil moisture observations can alert of impending drought, such as what's been underway in the Western US this year. 


What this means is that soil moisture deficits can dry crops and make them more vulnerable to pests. Even short-term drought can cause damage to crops, mainly during critical stages of crop development, such as after planting or during flowering. 


If the drought persists, crop yields could come underestimates this year and result in elevated agricultural prices.

Even as the supermajor oil companies shrink in size and adhere to incessant criticism, fossil-fuel demand holds strong, according to Yahoo Finance. Activists have been the busiest they have been in years...

Sooo.... White Supremacy was the biggest problem in America up until Hunter said the n-word.

Now we're back to climate change... got it.

On day later, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 'corrected' Biden, asserting instead that the biggest threats facing the US are China and Russia, according to US News, (and who allegedly had a big role in scamming half of pandemic unemployment funds to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars…]]></summary>

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Remember when networks and legal experts (correctly) denounced President Donald Trump for his attacks on judges who ruled against him?


Two years ago, I ran a column noting that Democrats were adopting the same attacks on conservative judges but the media was entirely silent.


Now,  California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democrats are lambasting a federal judge who ruled in favor of gun rights in a recent decision — accusing him of being in the pocket of the NRA and a danger to the country.  The response to Newsom’s attack from all of those same media and legal experts has ranged from outright support to conspicuous silence.

A former ADT security technician was sentenced to four years and four months in federal prison for repeatedly hacking into customers' video feeds in North Texas and spying on attractive women and couples engaging in sexual activity inside their homes, according to CBS Dallas.


Tesforo Aviles (via the Daily Mail)


Telesforo Aviles, 35, pleaded guilty to computer fraud in January - admitting to adding his personal email address to customers' "ADT Pulse" accounts, which gave him real-time access to video feeds from their homes. In some instances he claimed he needed to add himself temporarily to "test" the system, while in other cases he added himself without customer knowledge.


According to plea papers, Aviles watched numerous videos of naked women and couples engaging in sexual activity, which he admitted he would view for sexual gratification.


Aviles accessed roughly 200 customer accounts over 9,600 times without their consent.


"This deliberate and calculated invasion of privacy is arguably more harmfrul than if I had installed no security system and my house had been burglarized," said one female victim in a statement to the court. "This sick and corrupt individual's actions will have a lasting emotional and mental toll on me."


"This defendant, entrusted with safeguarding customers’ homes, instead intruded on their most intimate moments," Acting US Attorney Perak Shah said in January.


Aviles faced up to five years in prison.


Unfortunately for the victims, they couldn't opt-out of Aviles' intrusions like Amazon Sidewalk customers. You never know who's on the other end.

As foreign governments reportedly accumulate gold and de-dollarize their sovereign wealth funds, a Republican congressman is asking tough questions of the U.S. Treasury about its secretive gold activities.


Representative Alex Mooney (R-WV) – sponsor of the Gold Reserve Transparency Act of 2021 (H.R. 3526) to require the first true audit of America’s gold in decades – wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen this week requesting detailed information about the U.S. gold holdings delegated to the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund and posed other questions.

On Thursday the state-run Central Bank of Cuba (BCC) announced that it's suspending all deposits in US dollars due to what it called America's "economic blockade" of the country's banking system. 


"Given the obstacles imposed by the US economic blockade for the Cuban banking system to depositing abroad cash in US dollars collected in the country, the decision has been made to temporarily stop the acceptance of bills in that currency by the Cuban banking and finance system," national media cited the bank as saying.

With pandemic restrictions finally being wound down around the country, the economy should be roaring back to life. But we’ve seen much more muted job growth than expected, and we have a record-breaking 9.3 million unfilled job openings while millions of Americans languish on unemployment welfare.

An Arkansas State Police trooper is being sued after running out of patience while trying to initiate a traffic stop, and eventually flipping over a pregnant woman's vehicle during a traffic stop on a major highway.


Dashcam video of the incident was released this week showing the driver, Nicole Harper, traveling down I-67 when Senior Cpl. Rodney Dunn tried to pull her over for speeding. Instead of pulling over, she continued down the highway, moving over to the right lane and slowing down with her hazard lights on.


While the woman claims she was looking for a safe place to pull over, the officer ran out of patience. In the video the Arkansas State Police trooper is seen using a PIT maneuver "which caused Harper’s car to crash into the concrete median and flip," according to Fox 16. 





“In my head I was going to lose the baby,” Harper told Fox 16. The video shows the officer asking her: “Why didn’t you stop?” 


She responded: “Because I didn’t feel it was safe.”


The officer then says, "well this is where you ended up.”


“I thought it would be safe to wait until the exit,” the driver pleads. The officer responds: “no ma’am, you pull over when law enforcement stops you.”﻿


Jalopnik noted that "Dunn gave Harper all of two minutes before he nudged her car" and that the driver was "less than a mile from the nearest exit with a wide shoulder."


In the interim, Harper did just what the Arkansas State Police’s Driver License Study Guide says you are supposed to do when being pulled over. “What to do When You Are Stopped,” number one says to use, “emergency flashers to indicate to the officer that you are seeking a safe place to stop,” Fox 16 reported.


“I did slow down, I turned on my hazards, I thought I was doing the right thing,” Harper said.﻿

The Trump Justice Department in 2017 and early 2018 issued subpoenas to Apple to obtain the communications records of at least two Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Eric Swalwell (D-CA). According to The New York Times, DOJ prosecutors attempting to determine who leaked classified information to the media about Russiagate suspected the two House Democrats were the culprits, and to prove that, they obtained their communications records as well as those of family members, including minor children.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We Are Building Up To A Big Accident" - Gap Between 10Y Yields And CPI Is The Highest Since 1980

            
Even though US CPI smashed expectations again, Deustche Bank's chief credit strategist Jim Reid correctly points out that "the data isn’t going to change anyone’s mind of whether inflation is transitory or not."


Still, as an aside for those who still care about fundamentals, he notes that the current gap between 10yr US yields (c.1.5%) and US CPI (5.0%) is a whopping 3.5%, the highest since 1980. In fact, the gap has only been more negative for 10 months in the last 70 years, all of which were in 1974, 1975 or 1980.







Another way of visualizing the unprecedented divergence between core inflation and 10Y yields is the following scattergram from Longview economics:







While such a deeply negative (albeit crude) proxy for real yields (as opposed to the manipulated ones where the Fed is implicitly setting real rates with its purchases of TIPS) is great for financial conditions today, the DB credit strategist asks, rhetorically, if "we are building up to a big accident with such a mismatch between inflation and bond yields?"


And just as rhetorically, Reid concludes that despite this stunning observation, "no-one is going to have a different opinion to what they had yesterday though" (although If anyone's mind has changed, Reid would love to hear from you).

On June 1st, Mudrick Capital went from hero to zero in the eyes of Reddit's Wall Street Bets rebels as the hedge fund scooped up $230 million in newly issued stock at an above market price ($27.12), prompting Redditors to herald the fund as the company's savior and sparking a bullish move in the stock - now that the firm was (marginally) better capitalized.



In our view, this is not mindless dilution, but rather this is very smart raising of cash so that we can grow this company... to many of you on Twitter, to grow YOUR company. Watch out naysayers, $AMC is going to play on offense again. Here we come! {5 of 5}

Readers may remember earlier this year when an accident at the Emergent Biosolutions lab in Baltimore led to millions of J&J and AstraZeneca doses being ruined (after workers cross-contaminated them with ingredients from AstraZeneca jabs being produced in the same factory).


Since the incident, the FDA has been reviewing safety and production procedures at the facility. But despite the US government handing over control to J&J, attempts to re-start production have been in limbo, and according to the NYT, another 60MM doses produced at the facility didn't meet the agency's safety standards.

The pace of GDP growth is likely to peak in Q2. That makes sense given the amount fiscal stimulus in the first few months.

	

	

	
But it is the pace of deceleration that matters more, and that remains an open question.

	

	

	
This is interest because the pace will affect inflation, yields, and the Fed.

The US continues to downplay expectations for the upcoming summit between President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin that is scheduled for June 16th in Geneva.


The meeting comes as US-Russia relations are at their lowest point since the Cold War. Despite the dangerous path the two largest nuclear powers are on, the Biden administration doesn’t seem interested in any diplomatic breakthroughs.

While Tesla's Cybertruck remains in limbo somewhere and Lordstown Motors is on the brink of failure, Ford Motor Company's F-150 Lightning pre-order count continues to surge. 


Three weeks ago, Ford unveiled the F-150 Lightning, an all-electric truck, delivering 563 horsepower and 775 lb.-ft. of torque. In the first 48 hours of release, the company received 44,500 pre-orders, according to CEO Jim Farley. 







Now, the pre-order count has reached 100,000 and continues to climb, according to Engadget. The F-Series line is America's best-selling truck for more than four decades. Millions of loyal Ford customers would never buy a Chevy, nevertheless, a Tesa or some other startup with a limited track record. 


By comparison, since 2019, Tesla's Cybertruck has accumulated over 1 million Cybertruck reservations. Ford has a much larger following than Tesla and could surpass reservations. 


Besides Ford's loyal customer base, spanning generations, President Sleepy Joe gave the car company free press last month when he was seen driving around in the vehicle on a closed course. 





"This sucker is quick," Biden said at the press conference. 


Reservations require a $100 refundable deposit. Ford has said the F-150 Lightning deliveries should begin in the spring of 2022. The Cybertruck is expected to be released in late 2022 but really, who knows. 


Those who made reservations for the Ford electric truck will only have to wait about 10-12 months until delivery. Meanwhile, those who made Cybertruck reservations have been waiting for a couple of years.

Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,


The pace at which conditions are changing is catching a lot of people off guard.  Here in the United States, we have been in a low inflation environment for most of the past four decades, and so many Americans don’t even have a frame of reference for what a highly inflationary environment looks like.  But now we are facing an inflation crisis that is unlike anything that we have seen since the Jimmy Carter era in the 1970s.  In response to the COVID pandemic, governments around the world have been borrowing and spending colossal mountains of money, and global central banks have been absolutely flooding their respective financial systems with new cash…]]></summary>

While the mainstream media focused on the hope-filled headlines that, for the first time since 2003, the FDA approved Biogen's Aduhelm treatment for Alzheimer's Disease; few, if any, were fully aware of the levels of controversy behind the scenes.







Aside from the scientific uncertainty over whether amyloid plaque treatments are an approach worth continuing...



Despite the dominance of the amyloid hypothesis over the past few decades, evidence that links reductions in plaque levels to improvements in cognition is “thin, at best”, says Jason Karlawish, a geriatrician and co-director of the Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

A research study published in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association describes “whiteness” as a parasitic pathology that has no cure.







Yes, really.


The article, which is entitled ‘On Having Whiteness’, was written by Dr. Donald Moss (who is white), a faculty member of both the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and the San Francisco Center for Psychoanalysis.


Moss asserts that white people have a “particular susceptibility” to the “parasitic” condition, which he says “renders its hosts’ appetites voracious, insatiable, and perverse” and leads them to “terrorize” non-whites.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said former President Donald Trump would have won the 2020 election if investigations into the origin of COVID-19 and whether it escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, were not politicized.



“If COVID-19 had come about due to a Chinese lab leak, the top question on voters’ minds in the 2020 election would have become who was going to stand up to China. Which candidate would hold the Chinese accountable for unleashing the COVID-19 plague on the world?” wrote Graham for Fox News on Thursday.

Less than a week ago, we reported that the US COVID-19 vaccination scheme had fallen dramatically in recent weeks, likely a factor of a drop in new cases combined with an easing of facemask requirements.


And as President Biden scrambles to hit his July 4 target to vaccinate more than 70% of adults, a goal that's looking increasingly remote every day, the NYT reported Thursday morning that there's one region of the country that's seeing vaccination demand fall more sharply than the others: And that's the deep south.

Journalist Jeffrey Toobin, who was suspended by CNN and fired from The New Yorker after he was caught masturbating on a zoom call last October in full view of colleagues, has been allowed back into the fold at the failing cable news network following a six-month period of 'reflection and growth.'







Hilariously, he had to sit there as CNN host Alisyn Camerota rang the shame bell behind him - then explain his side of it.


"...you were caught masturbating, on camera. You were subsequently fired from that job after 27 years of working [at the New Yorker], and you since then have been on leave from CNN," said Camerota, adding "What the hell were you thinking?"


Toobin acknowledged that he had been "deeply moronic," and his actions were "indefensible," adding that he's spent the last seven "miserable months" trying to be a better person, "in therapy, trying to do some public service, working at a food bank, working on a new book..."


Good to know what it takes to compel Toobin to engage in charitable acts. We can only hope he washed his hands before dealing with people's food.

As much as half of the unemployment benefits paid by the US government over the past year may have been stolen through fraud, with the bulk ultimately ending up outside the country - likely into the hands of foreign crime syndicates in China, Nigeria, Russia and elsewhere, according to Axios' Felix Salmon.

"Fool me once, shame on... shame on you. Fool me... you can't get fooled again," were the infamous words of former President Bush and we suspect that Steve Cohen protégé Gabe Plotkin is reflecting on those stoic words as he looks back at his fund's performance in May.


Plotkin's Melvin Capital - infamously blown-up by a retail rampage during January's WSB Raid on heavily-shorted stocks - was joined by another fund, Light Street Capital, run by Glen Kacher (a Tiger Cub) in suffering significant losses as the sense of deja vu all over again in markets sent the most-heavily-shorted 'Meme stocks' soaring to even higher highs once again in May.







As The FT reports, hedge fund losses just from betting against five popular meme stocks - GameStop, Bed Bath & Beyond, AMC, BlackBerry and Clover Health - total about $6bn since the start of May, according to the data firm Ortex Analytics.


It appears the bailout of Melvin Capital (which after sustaining a $4.5bn loss in January got $2.75bn in new cash from Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Ken Griffin’s Citadel) was used to maintain his big shorts... and suffer a Sisyphean loss on his shorts once again.


Perhaps more notably, Peter Hillerberg, Ortex’s co-founder, said funds had recently reduced their short positions in meme stocks but that short interest remained “at very high levels”.


The FT reports that Melvin is now down 44.7% YTD (against the S&P's +12%) with $11 billion AUM; and Light Street is down 20.1% YTD with $3.3 billion AUM.


Both firms declined to comment...

Appearing on Newsmax, Paul noted “I think it’s this — it’s one-size-fits-all and his idea that the regular people aren’t smart enough to make these regular decisions. So he just wants to treat everybody the same.”



“The one-size-fits-all strategy that everybody must get vaccinated ignores the science,” the Senator continued, adding “It’s mostly that he’s not telling the truth once again because he is an elitist, and he thinks we can’t handle the truth.”

June is typically the month the wildfire season in California begins. The state is already battling an extreme drought, and the first heat wave of the season hit last week. The risks of another heat wave are increasing for next week. 


The hottest and most fire-prone months are nearing as a second heat wave of the season could arrive as early as next week. 


How the season turns out may depend on the immediate climate in the state. Extreme heat and drought are several factors that may produce dry fuels and eventually spark fires. 


Forecast temperature anomalies daily are expected to jump for the southern part of the state by Tuesday/Wednesday and then the whole state by Friday. In many parts of the state, temperature anomalies, the difference from an average, or baseline, temperature, could be +14 degrees. Forecasts suggest Bakersfield and Fresno could reach triple digits. 







Prospects of the next heat wave come as the Drought Monitor (dated June 3) shows much of California, nevertheless, the West Coast, is experiencing some level of drought. 







California could be headed for a dangerous wildfire season with conditions already parched. 


Further, we want to monitor power prices in the state as grid demand could overwhelm supply, and power companies could issue rolling blackouts to conserve power or prevent wildfires.

Real Vision managing editor Ed Harrison welcomes Dave Floyd, founder of Aspen Trading, to break down the implications of today’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) print, which reached a 13-year high of 5.0% in yearly change. As concerns of inflation continue to apply pressure on the U.S. economy and markets, Floyd will be considering how this impacts bonds, equities, and currencies.

By Eric Kulisch of Freight Waves,


Ground service providers drowning in shipments delivered by airlines are responding to massive gridlock at Chicago O’Hare by permanently relocating some warehouse operations outside the property  to increase capacity in what could increasingly become a model at major U.S. airports that haven’t prioritized investment in cargo facilities.







Alliance Ground International (AGI), with stations around the country, and local ground handling agent Maestro International Cargo this month are both opening large, off-airport transfer facilities to enable faster pickup of import cargo, which currently can take up to six days to retrieve after an aircraft’s arrival.

By Steven Englander and John Davies, FX and Rates strategists at Standard Chartered Bank


The Fed has indicated that it does not see its expected inflation surge in the coming months as pointing to longer-term pressures. Many investors are sceptical, but do not have a framework from which to push back against the Fed’s optimism that it can manage a "gentle inflation overshoot."


Here we argue that looking at trimmed mean inflation is a straightforward way of assessing whether an inflation surge is broad-based or narrow. So far, we find small indications that these broad-based inflation indicators are rising, but nothing conclusive. This assessment could change in the coming months.

In a recent blog post from DB's Francis Yared, the credit strategist looks at one of the lesser discussed drivers of inflation and points out that supply shocks to oil prices have historically been relevant for inflation expectations.


As Yared writes, "supply shock to oil prices have had a significant impact on inflation expectations on three occasions over the past half century: in the mid 70s, the mid 80s and the mid 10s." However, unlike the infamous price explosions of the 70s and 80s, in the latest episode the "shale oil revolution" resulted in a significant positive supply shock to oil markets which led OPEC in 2014 to defend its market share rather than oil prices.

Who is receiving more attention on television news since the inauguration, President Joe Biden or former president Donald Trump?


The graph below shows the total mentions of President Biden across CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and BBC News London since Biden's inauguration day. Fox News has mentioned him the most, though even BBC News London has mentioned him nearly a third as often as CNN and MSNBC.







In contrast, the graph below shows that Fox News has covered former president Donald Trump far less than CNN or MSNBC. Look closely and you will notice that CNN and MSNBC have actually mentioned Trump more than Biden.







The graph below compares the two presidents since Biden's inauguration, comparing mentions of Biden (blue) against Trump (orange).







On MSNBC, former president Trump has received 129% of the coverage of President Biden, followed closely by CNN's 118%. On BBC News London, Trump has received 83% of Biden's mentions, while on Fox News Trump has received just 55% as much coverage as Biden.

"U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) estimates that we have completed greater than 50% of the entire retrograde process," the command announced Tuesday. And in terms of the massive logistical feat of removing military hardware after a two-decade occupation and build-up of bases, the military statement added that it's removed the equivalent of approximately 500 C-17 planeloads of material while also removing 13,000 pieces of equipment.

For over a year, there has been one fact that has been repeated in literally thousands of news stories: former Attorney General Bill Barr ordered the clearing of Lafayette Park on June 1, 2020 to allow former President Donald Trump to hold his controversial photo op in front of St. John’s Church. 


From the outset, there was ample reason to question the claim echoed across media outlets. As I noted in my testimony to Congress on the protest that month, the operation was clearly a response to days of violent and destructive protests. 


Now the Inspector General has completed its investigation and the report debunks the conspiracy theor…]]></summary>

Company executives and insiders could be playing by a new set of 10b5-1 plan rules soon.


That's because the Securities and Exchange Commission, headed up by Gary Gensler, has signaled that it plans on seeking to revise the rules that govern the stock trading plans, which are usually set up ahead of time to allow insiders to sell stock on a schedule. 


The plans have drawn scrutiny because there is no required disclosure when they are set up, despite many companies choosing to disclose the plans, and because they can be modified or canceled. They have also come under scrutiny after analysis from Stanford and U Penn found the plans were used for “opportunistic, large-scale selli…]]></summary>

In order to justify the forced vaccination of children, the powers that be would somehow have to overturn 15 months of observations that COVID is less a threat to children than the flu and that unvaccinated children are less at risk than vaccinated adults (100 times less at risk than seniors), even if we are to believe Pfizer's efficacy data.

Inflation will be transitory, blah-blah-blah--I beg to differ, for these reasons. There are numerous structural sources of inflation, which I define as prices rise while the quality and quantity of goods and services remain the same or diminish. Since the word inflation is so loaded, let's use the more neutral (and more accurate) term decline in purchasing power: an hour of your labor buys fewer goods and services of lesser quality than it did a decade ago or a generation ago.

With the latest heat wave subsiding in the northeastern U.S., after several days of dangerously high temperatures above 90 degrees, power prices skyrocketed as tens of millions turned down their thermostats. 


According to Bloomberg, electricity prices in New England tripled on Monday from a year ago. Since the weekend, a heat wave blanketed the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast but will subside by midweek. 


Gary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy, said energy demands are way "above normal" for this time of year because of increasing air-conditioning use. New England's grid operator could reach its summer peak in June instead of August, typically the hottest part of summer.


Monday's highs were 90-95 degrees in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area to New York City to Boston. 


Grid operator PJM Interconnection LLC, a regional transmission organization serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, issued a hot weather alert Monday. PJM requested owners of transmission lines and power plants to delay maintenance. 


On-peak electricity prices for Bloomingdale, Massachusetts, energy prices per megawatt-hour spiked on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. 







Peak energy prices for New York City also spiked. 







The heat wave is expected to dissipate by mid-week as Mid-Atlantic and Northeast temperatures will be around average or slightly below normal as a cold front rolls in through the weekend.

Seventy-six percent of U.S. adults say they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or plan to be, a number that has been stable over the past three months but is higher than in late 2020 and early 2021.







As of the May 18-23 survey, 60% of U.S. adults report they have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 4% have been partially vaccinated, 12% plan to be vaccinated and 24% do not plan to be vaccinated.


Among those not planning to be vaccinated, 78% say they are unlikely to reconsider their plans, including 51% who say they are "not likely at all" to change their mind and get vaccinated. That leaves one in five vaccine-reluctant adults open to recons…]]></summary>

We recently discussed the case of Loudoun County teacher Byron “Tanner” Cross who was suspended for speaking against gender policies. In a major victory for the free speech rights of teachers, Twelfth Circuit Judge James E. Plowman ordered LCPS to restore Cross’ position as a physical education teacher at Leesburg Elementary School. In a letter, the court found a basis for a temporary injunction to allow Cross to return until Dec. 31 pending further orders of the court.

Speculation has been running rampant over today's FBI press conference revealing the recovery of most of the ransom paid to "Russian" hackers by Colonial Pipeline.


Ben THE Kaufman summarizes:



Media: "The FBI hacked Bitcoin and can take anyone's funds."


Reality: The pipeline hackers didn't have the Bitcoin in the first place but kept it in a remote server the FBI could access with subpoena.


Media coverage is mostly lies at this point.



Which raises the following point (h/t Jordan Schachtel):



So the "hackers" brought down the largest pipeline on the east coast...

Just as Ontario finally lifted some of its COVID-19-inspired travel restrictions, the US Department of State announced plans to revise its travel advisory for dozens of countries, including its neighbors, Canada and Mexico. While the border between American and Canada may remain closed until September, the State Department's decision to lower its travel advisory to a Level 3 from a Level 4 could have major implications for tourism around the world.


Back in April, the US rated about 150 countries out of 209 as "Level 4: Do Not Travel." Today that number has fallen to about 125 at the highest advisory level.

Twitter handle "Insider Paper" reports a massive fire has erupted at a polysilicon plant in China. 







According to the report, "an explosion" occurred at a polysilicon plant in Shihezi City, Xinjiang, China. Polysilicon, or poly-Si, is used as a raw material by the solar photovoltaic and electronics industries.

This report is so far unconfirmed by major western media outlets and is developing... But if confirmed, this could have severe implications for the global semiconductor industry, which is already in a terrible shortage.

Iran nuclear talks in Vienna continue dragging on and despite recent weeks of positive developments and optimistic statements of being on the cusp of a restored deal, things are more tense than ever heading into a sixth round of talks set to begin on Thursday.


This is after a briefing issued by the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) early this week which alleged Iran is failing to cooperate with the nuclear watchdog after it found nuclear particles at multiple undeclared sites, possibly suggesting a more expanded program than previously believed.

After India finally gets somewhat of a grip on its deadly second wave, one of its health regulators just took away one of its main lines of defense. 







India’s Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) has executed a policy reversal that could have massive implications for the battle against covid-19, not only in India but around the world. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives, are at providing stake. Providing no explanation whatsoever, the DGHS has overhauled its COVID-19 treatment guidelines and removed almost all of the repurposed medicines it had previously recommended for treating asymptomatic and mild…]]></summary>

In case we needed more proof that the US labor market is in a historic supply-demand mismatch crisis sparked by Biden's generous unemployment benefits, a few hours after the latest NFIB showed that it has never been more difficult for small business to fill job openings, moments ago the BLS confirmed what we expected: that the number of job openings in March (recall JOLTS is one month delayed) soared by a record 998K to 9.286MM in April from an upward revised 8.288MM in march, and the highest in the history of US jobs data!







The record number was also a record beat to the already lofty expectations of a 8.2 million print.

Throughout 2020, investors left the commodity sector discarded at the trash heap of the market, focusing instead entirely on growth and deflation names. Fast forward to today and boy have things changed: not only have growth names done little to nothing in 2021, a year which has seen near record shorting of tech names and a constant outflow of equity funds...







... but as sentiment shifts toward "value", commodity-linked stocks have been rising every day, and even such boring names as Exxon and Chevron have recently turned into hedge fund darlings, attracting a bevy of activist shareholders and pushing higher by the day.

Damn near every economist and analyst seem oblivious to the point being made in this article. The Fed should be ecstatic so many people are willing to invest in intangible assets. By not buying  tangible and real items they help to minimize inflation. In our bullshit world where media outlets like Bloomberg tout the message if you are not in this rising market, you are missing out, it is understandable that people want in. With this in mind, it is no wonder the investment world has become a minefield that is often compared to a casino.

Alabama and Georgia real estate agents have asked the Supreme Court to block a federal moratorium on evictions that was imposed last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid the pandemic.







Congress enacted a nationwide moratorium on evictions and extended its life through Jan. 31, 2021. The Atlanta-based CDC, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, then imposed its own moratorium at the behest of then-President Donald Trump, the current iteration of which is set to run out on June 30.

A mysterious surge in dollar lending by Chinese banks in an arcane corner of the financial market is leading some investors to wonder whether it’s somehow related to the “stealth intervention” by the PBOC to slow yuan appreciation.


For years, Chinese banks had little use for foreign-currency reverse repo, which is effectively collateralized lending. That has dramatically changed since the pandemic. Banks’ FX reverse repos surged to a record $87 billion in April, from less than $2 billion a year earlier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Currency Story Has Undergone A Silent, Subtle Curve Shift

            
By Ven Ram, Bloomberg reporter and macro commentator


Front-end yields held hostage by central banks around the world have engendered a silent shift in currency pricing: exchange movements are being increasingly influenced by changes in the intermediate and longer segments of the yield curve.


Currencies that were typically more responsive to relative changes in yields at, say, the two-year part of the curve are now responding more and more to shifts at the five- and 10-year segments, with the dollar being a case in point.







The chart above shows how closely the Dollar Index has tracked five-year real yield spreads between the U.S. and Germany (hat tip to J. Paul Knight, assistant portfolio manager of U.S. large-cap equity at the Employees Retirement System of Texas for his observation). Indeed, the correlation between the spreads and the dollar in the past year is running at 0.57, reflecting its influence on the currency. Taken together with 10-year differentials , the two points of the curve delineate the trajectory of the dollar by more than four-fifths.







To be sure, it wasn’t always like this. Take a look at this chart above that encompasses a longer time frame, which shows the Dollar Index ignoring the movement in spreads. That was a time clearly before the pandemic when the U.S. economy was still in the midst of its longest post-war expansion, with central banks not anywhere near controlling the yield curve, de facto or de jure.

It looks like much to the surprise of no one, there's considerable waste and malfeasance taking place at the perpetually-taxpayer-bailed-out MTA.


A new MTA inspector general's report has revealed that MTA track engineers - to quote Rep. Al Green talking about Citadel earlier this year - "have been naughty for some time".


The inspector general is reportedly "furious" after the findings of an 11 month investigation found that seven NYC Transit track inspectors were skipping inspections and falsifying inspection reports. The employees in question have been suspended, according to an RT&S report.

Malaysian police are using drones which can check temperatures from as high as 20 meters above ground in the latest example of coronavirus population control.







The drones alert authorities if someone has a high temperature reading by emitting a red light, according to Bernama, Malaysia’s state news agency.


“Malaysian police have previously warned they will use drones to enforce earlier travel restrictions, with officers in some areas also stating they would carry out surprise home visits to ensure people were following rules,” reports the Guardian.

A New York parent brought the heat to members of the Carmel Central School District board for 'emotionally abusing' children by 'indoctrinating them with communist values.'







In comments at a school board business meeting in Putnam County, NY on Thursday, parent Tatiyana Ibrahim - whose child is a student, slammed the educators for promoting Critical Race Theory (CRT), Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ and anti-police ideologies both on and off campus.


"Stop indoctrinating our children. Stop teaching our children to hate the police. Stop teaching our children that if they don’t agree with the LGBT community that they’re homophobic. You have no idea each child’s life," she said, adding "You don’t know what their family lifestyle consists of, you don’t know the makeup of their life."


Watch:





Ibrahim shut down school board members' objections several times - in between calling out two teachers for posting their political beliefs online. When board members told her she wasn't allowed to reference people by name, Ibrahim claimed those teachers called "for the death of a former president," and that students who don't support Black Lives Matter should be "canceled out."


"Why are we not allowed to say names? Why am I not allowed when they purposefully expose themselves on social media, talking about calling for the death of a former president, or saying that any child who doesn’t believe in Black Lives Matter should be canceled out. Is this what my tax dollars are paying for?" she asked.


"You’re emotionally abusing our children and mentally abusing them," Ibrahim continued. "You’re demoralizing them by teaching them communist values, this is still America, ma’am."

By Tom Ozimek of The Epoch Times


Texas has joined a coalition of what is now 25 states urging the U.S. Supreme Court to repeal a New Jersey law banning the possession of firearms with magazines that hold more than 10 bullets, arguing the prohibition violates the Second Amendment and puts law-abiding citizens less able to defend themselves against dangerous criminals.


Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced in a statement that he had signed onto an amicus brief (pdf) which argues that allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms with 11-plus capacity magazines benefits public safety, counterbalances the threat of illegal gun violence, and helps “make our streets safer.”…]]></summary>

Since then, Rhoades has really made a go of it, pitching coins like "cumrocket" and "titcoin".

Below is my column in the Hill on the future of the filibuster and why this may be the most credible period for the use of such a compromise-forcing rule. There have always been good-faith arguments against the use of such a rule as inhibiting democratic voting. After all, the rule blocks bare majority voting. However, with a razor-thin margin in both houses, the use of such a rule can help force greater dialogue and compromise in Congress, which most voters indicate that they want in polls. It now appears that Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.V.) will block the federal voting rights legislation even without a filibuster. As a result he was attacked …]]></summary>

As we learned over the weekend via a communique from G-7 ministers, a pillar of the deal envisaged that the tax would apply on "profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises."

The superficial "return to normal" narrative focuses solely on first order effects: now that people can dispense with masks and social distancing, they are resuming their pre-pandemic spending orgy with a vengeance, which augurs great profits for Corporate America and higher tax revenues. Yea for "return to normal."

After several months of blowout consumer credit prints, including two consecutive months in which revolving (i.e., credit card) debt, rose after shrinking 10 of the previous 11 months, America's credit-funded spending spree abruptly slowed in April, when total consumer credit rose by $18.6BN, down from $25.8BN in March (since revised conveniently to $18.6BN), and missing expectations of $20.5BN. Overall, total consumer credit rose at a 5.3% annual rate in April to a new all time high of $4.238 trillion.

It still looks like we are nowhere near the end of the ongoing global semi chip shortage. Even worse, more manufacturers are confirming that the shortage could last "for at least another year", catalyzed by sharp post-pandemic demand for automobiles and electronics.

Following up on The Trap which suggested recent market strength may turn into a bull trap.







Last week again we saw the tiniest dip in markets instantly reverted and markets again closed at the weekly highs on Friday, near all time highs as a matter of fact. Indeed, the historical backtest scenarios outlined in The Trap permit for marginal new highs. And in keeping with observing the set up develop we can note that during this renewed run higher last week we saw something we haven’t seen since the last major top.

Liftoff of NASA's Mars helicopter Ingenuity will occur no later than today if all goes to plan, according to a NASA press release. 


Ingenuity, a small robotic helicopter weighing no more than 4 pounds, is preparing for its seventh flight today. The mission is to fly Ingenuity 350 feet south from its current location on the floor of Jezero Crater. 



"This will mark the second time the helicopter will land at an airfield that it did not survey from the air during a previous flight," NASA wrote. "Instead, the Ingenuity team is relying on imagery collected by the HiRISE camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that suggests this new base of operations is relatively flat and has few surface obstructions."



On May 22, Ingenuity flew its sixth mission that did not go so well. The solar-powered helicopter experienced glitches that interrupted internal systems. There was no mention of what caused the glitches; the craft was able to land safely. 







Ingenuity has marvelously performed five flights and beamed incredible images from Mars back to Earth. 


NASA also has the Perseverance rover conducting land-based missions in the search for life. 


In the last couple of months, the Red Planet has become a hotspot for the US and China, with China landing a rover of its own on the planet.


Sudden interest in Mars between both countries is because the planet allegedly has an abundance of rare metals that will power tomorrow's economy.

By Variant Perception


We have seen much commentary that if US 10y yields go back to 2.5% or 3.0%, then equity markets suffer.  We prefer a different way to looking at the problem.  The key is what inflation is doing alongside any move in nominal yields. The below chart shows the % of the US yield curve trading below inflation. We highlight in green the periods when more than 50% of the yield curve is trading below inflation (as is the case today).

Typically, negative real yields are very stimulative for equities.  It is only when most of the yield curve is trading above inflation (white bars in right chart above) that equity markets start to face persistent headwinds.


Equity investors do need to worry about rising yields in terms of sector rotation.  Duration is a basic concept for fixed income investors, but for equity investors, it is a less common method to look at portfolio exposures.


We have built a duration calculator for equities, using a combination of a 15-year DCF (consensus earnings forecasts, 2% terminal growth rate, individual cost of equity) and a terminal value duration component. This allows us to see which equities are most sensitive to a move in yields.


For the stocks in the Russell 1000, we calculate the duration of each name and aggregate to find the duration for different sectors. Financials, energy and consumer staples look like relative safe-havens. Info tech, healthcare and consumer discretionaries have the highest durations and are more vulnerable to yield moves.

Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),


California, with its relatively large tax burden compared to other states, has seen a taxpayer exodus in recent years and, along with it, billions in taxable gross income.


State-to-state migration data recently released by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shows that California lost an estimated net 70,534 households—or 165,355 taxpayers and their dependents—in the years 2017-2018, with those fleeing taking around $8.8 billion in net adjusted gross income with them.

Bukele said Saturday he will send a bill to the Central American country's Congress next week to make bitcoin legal tender.



#Bitcoin has a market cap of $680 billion dollars.

Over the past few weeks, we’ve been spending a lot of time with investors discussing and debating our mid-year outlook. Here are the highlights:



First, investors are definitely more receptive to the mid-cycle transition narrative that we introduced a few months ago. There’s an acknowledgement that something has changed in the market, because more investors are struggling to make money consistently as leadership flip-flops day to day. This is consistent with the typical mid-cycle transition as the market struggles to find the next consensus trade.

If you fall under any of the above and you're falsely claiming to be a resident of Puerto Rico, the IRS has a message for you: 'We're waiting for you...' 


According to Bloomberg Tax, the agency has been the focus of a "sweeping" review to examine individuals who took advantages of the tax incentives. According to the report, "More than 4,000 mainland U.S. residents and firms have moved to the territory between 20…]]></summary>

Donald Trump will return to the political stage Saturday night with a speech at the North Carolina Republican Convention - his first major speech since CPAC in February, but more importantly - his first since he was vindicated over the possibility that COVID-19 escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.







It also comes after anti-Trump GOP Congresswoman Liz Cheney (WY) was outed from her leadership position due to her frequent criticism of Trump.


In a Friday statement, the former president said that it would be "a great honor to be speaking at the North Carolina GOP convention," adding "I understand the place will be packed, all records broken!"


Trump carried North Carolina during both of his presidential bids - visiting the state 14 times during the final year of his presidency. He's scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. to a sold out audience of 1,250 people.

Via WeMeantWell.com,


In the post-vaccination era, why don’t people remove their masks? Learned helplessness, employed as a control tool.







Learned helplessness is well-documented. It takes place when an individual believes he continuously faces a negative, uncontrollable situation and stops trying to improve his circumstances, even when he has the ability to do so. Discovering the loss of control elicits a passive reaction to a harmful situation. Psychologists call this a maladaptive response, characterized by avoidance of challenges and the collapse of problem-solving when obstacles arise. You give up trying to fight back.


An example may help: you must keep up with ever-changing mask and other hygiene theatre rules,…]]></summary>

The higher they push phantom "assets" based on exponential increases in leverage, the greater the air gap between essential tangibles and fantasy.


Inflation is in the news, but there are a couple of things about inflation that don't get much coverage. Let's start with the trope that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. Actually, no.


When nutrient-rich soil and fresh water reserves are depleted, crop yields decline and as human population and appetites for animal protein soar, food becomes scarce. When food becomes scarce, prices rise accordingly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong Parking Spot Sells For Record-Breaking $1.3 Million

            
Even as thousands of Hong Kongers flee to the UK or elsewhere to escape China's crackdown on political freedoms, the city-state's property market is breaking yet another record.


Citing a report in the Hong Kong Economic Times, Bloomberg reports that Wharf Holdings and Nan Fung Group sold a parking space for HK$10.2 million ($1.3 million) at the luxury Mount Nicholson residential project, according to a source. The price beat the previous record of HK$7.6 million for a spot in an office tower set back in 2019, before Hong Kong's protest movement triggered a crackdown by Beijing that has engulfed the territory's future in uncertainty, especially since China can simply snatch anyone - foreign nationals or otherwise - from Hong Kong's jurisdiction.







Mount Nicholson has a reputation for being one of the most iconic upscale projects in Hong Kong. At one point, an apartment in the project was the most expensive in Asia before the title was taken by CK Asset Holdings Ltd.’s 21 Borrett Road in February.


As that record-breaking sale might suggest, the parking spot record isn't a total surprise. HK has been seeing a comeback in the luxury home market in recent months, seeing record-breaking transactions as buyer's confidence returns. A house on Hong Kong's famous Peak (a luxury residential area overlooking the rest of the city) just rented for HK$1.6 a month in May.


Still, despite its recent sharp rebound, Hong Kong's economy "isn't out of the woods just yet," according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau. HK's economy grew 7.9% in the first quarter of 2021 vs. a year ago, marking the first economic expansion after six consecutive quarters of contraction. Yau appeared on CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" Thursday morning to discuss it.





While retail sales have seen a strong rebound, tourism remains weak, and the expansion is on uneven footing, Yau said.

A recent report documented up to 6,000 foreign fishing vessels that disabled their public tracking devices for more than 24 hours along the border of Argentina’s national waters, sounding the alarm that they could be illegally fishing in the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).


“The Chinese fleet was responsible for 66 percent of these incidents,” said the June report by Oceana, a Washington-based non-profit organization dedicated to protecting and restoring the global oceans. The report claims that hundreds of Chinese fishing vessels mainly target shortfin squid, which is vital to both Argentina’s economy and ecosystem.

Taiwan is about to be front and center again this coming week as Washington prepares for its next shot across China's bow - this time by another high level US delegation, something which China has long condemned as "signaling pro-democracy forces" on the island in contradiction to the official One China policy. 


Reuters has confirmed in a weekend report that "Three US senators will visit Taiwan on Sunday and will meet President Tsai Ing-wen to discuss security and other issues, Taiwan's government and the de facto U.S. embassy in Taipei said on Saturday, a trip that will likely irritate China." The meeting is expected to be held at a military wing of the island's main international airport.

Earlier today the news started coming out that the US will start treating ransomware on par with terrorism. This is in the wake of a string of catastrophic attacks, not only ransomware but also several supply chain attacks.


There is some concern within crypto-currency circles that this may turn into a new FUD-cycle for Bitcoin. There is already no shortage of lo-res intellects calling for a ban on Bitcoin and crypto-currencies, thinking that even if cryptos could be banned (they can’t) that it would eliminate the problem of ransomware.


It wouldn’t.

There's now officially a children's book based on the "Great GME Squeeze of 2021".


Amazon has started selling a book called "Stonks On The Moon!" which tells the story - in children's parlance - of the "mayhem being inflicted on Wall Street by a new wave of retail investors championing the cause of GameStop Corp," according to WeBull.


The story tells the tale of Stonks, a young ape, who is helped along by a character based on Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill in building a rocket to visit the moon. 


According to WeBull, the book's author, who goes by the name "Professor Clark" is actually Dillon Clark, who calls himself "an IT professional at a bank in the middle of Illinois in the middle of a cornfield." 







Clark said: “It's kind of a children's book for adults and children. A kid can read it and be like, ‘Hey, I understand it. I get a good message from it.' But then the adult can read it and be like, ‘Oh, I see what's going on there'.”


“It's been great,” he stated. “All the apes on Reddit have been super, super nice.”


Clark is also holding out hope that Elon Musk will read the audio version: “I think ‘Stonks on the Moon!’ would be awesome if Elon Musk narrated. I've been tweeting at him every day for the last 35 days, and I'm doing it for a year straight.”


The book is 25 pages and already has 35 reviews with an average of 5 stars on Amazon, where it started selling on May 27. 







Meanwhile, the Fed still sees no signs of market excess...

Liberals are probably having a meltdown after a George W. Bush-appointed federal judge in California ruled the state's ban on assault weapons is unconstitutional. 







U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez of San Diego released a 94-page ruling late Friday, indicating California's three-decade ban on assault weapons violates the Second Amendment's right to bear arms.

A number of events are coming together which are set to push gold prices higher. Besides a combination of continuing inflationary policies and massive future budget deficits undermining the dollar, by closing down derivative market activities new Basel 3 regulations appear set to deflect some demand into physical metals. Furthermore, liquidity in gold markets will contract, potentially making prices more volatile

As even many casual observers of America’s fractious politics are aware, the overwhelming majority of lawmaking at the federal level no longer takes place in Congress as the Constitution’s framers intended. Instead, the vast majority of the “rulemaking” governing Americans’ day-to-day lives now takes place behind closed doors, deep in the bowels of the administrative state’s sprawling bureaucracy. The brainchild of progressive President Woodrow Wilson, arguments on behalf of the modern administrative state are ultimately rooted in, among other factors, a disdain for the messy give-and-take of republican politics and an epistemological preference for rul…]]></summary>

Cows produce significant amounts of methane as part of their digestive processes. Cow belching, a source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, could be solved by a new methane-absorbing wearable device. 


According to Bloomberg, agriculture behemoth Cargill Inc. tapped UK-based startup Zelp Ltd., which is dedicated to significantly reducing the environmental impact of the livestock industry through smart cow masks that filter methane burps. 







Cargill said Tuesday the devices would be used for its European dairy farmers in 2022. The price of each mask has yet to be publicly discussed, but Zelp said each cow would cost $80 per year as part of an annual subscription fee.

Closures due to the Covid pandemic resulted in $9.8 billion in lost construction activity and 74,000 direct and indirect lost jobs in New York City, according to a report by the Building Trades Employers’ Association. The decline in jobs contributed to a $5.5 billion loss in total wages, the report said.

	

	

	
The decline in activity also affected the city's Minority and Women Business Enterprises, as more than 85% of MWBEs are expected to be out of businesses in the next six months, according to a New York City Comptroller's Office survey cited in the report.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Most Americans believe that the coronavirus pandemic originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, with almost a quarter saying they believe it was released on purpose, according to a YouGov poll.







A total of 58% of Americans agree that its is ‘definitely or probably true’ that the virus came out of the Wuhan lab.



Wuhan virus, most agree.

58% believe China made the virus in a lab, and 24% say it was ‘released on purpose.' Sound familiar...https://t.co/j0BqPTWxdc pic.twitter.com/tTuWMEtG2C

The number represents a nine percent increase on findings from a year ago.


Even 43% of Democrats believe the virus came out of the lab.

Only 13% are still buying the ‘it mutated naturally from bats’ claim.


Indeed, YouGov notes “When it comes to the more specific circumstances of the virus’ emergence, 24% think it was created in a laboratory and was released on purpose, 18% think it was lab-created and escaped by accident, while a further 12% think it was a naturally occurring disease that was being examined in a laboratory but was released by accident.”


This is despite a massive co-ordinated attempt by the establishment media and big-tech to censor and dismiss the lab leak idea as a crazy ‘conspiracy theory’.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traders Rush To Ship Masked Venezuelan Crude To China

            
Authored by Charles Kennedy via OilPrice.com,


Commodity traders are in a rush to ship as much Venezuelan heavy crude to China as possible before a new fuel tax kicks in, causing a 40-50-percent rise in prices, Reuters reports, citing industry insiders and shipping data.







Over the last 12 months, China has seen a 13-fold increase in imports of bitumen blends, some 90 percent of which was actually heavy crude from Venezuela, according to data from cargo tracker Vortexa Analytics. The crude was labeled as Malaysian bitumen blend to avoid sanction action from the United States.


According to Vortexa, the average daily rate of Venezuelan oil imports into China over the past year was some 324,000 barrels, which represented about two-thirds of Venezuela's total exports of crude during the period.


However, things are about to change as China plans to introduce a tax on bitumen blend imports later this month. This will increase prices by 40 to 50 percent, and the flow of Venezuelan oil may well thin considerably.



"While not all of the 350,000 to 400,000 bpd of the additional bitumen flowing into China will disappear overnight, a large proportion of it will be at risk," an Energy Aspects analyst told Reuters.



U.S. sanctions have reduced Venezuelan oil output to some half a million barrels daily over the two years since they were introduced.







Even though the Biden administration has extended a sanction waiver for several U.S. oil companies, including Chevron and Halliburton, PDVSA is struggling to maintain production.


Earlier this year, the state-owned oil major calculated it would need investments of $58 billion to boost production to where it was before Hugo Chavez rose to power in the late 90s. In 1998, Venezuela was pumping 2.3 million barrels of crude daily. The company said it planned to seek investments from both local and foreign companies to that end.

According to Bloomberg, the ministers are meeting on Friday and Saturday in London, and will likely release a statement over the weekend once they have settled on a mutually-agreeable framework.

Senator Rand Paul, who has constantly challenged the contradictory and unscientific statements of Dr Fauci, as well as pointing out Fauci’s involvement in funding gain of function research with coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, appeared vindicated in an interview Thursday following disturbing revelations from released emails, which Paul urged should be the final nail in Fauci’s coffin.







Speaking to Laura Ingraham, Paul asserted that “The emails paint a disturbing picture, a disturbing picture of Dr. Fauci, from the very beginning, worrying that he had been funding gain-of-function research. He knows it to this day, but hasn’t admitted it.”

After today’s mixed US payrolls report, today’s Chart of the Day from DB's Jim Reid shows we are still 7.6 million jobs away from where we were when the pandemic hit. 


We lost 22.4 million in the first 2 months and have gained 14.7 million over the last 13 months. 2021 has "only" seen an average monthly payrolls increase of 478k though May.







And while some saw only disappointment in the May jobs data, it was a truly Goldilocks report: as Reid says, "there was clearly something for everyone in the report. The Fed will continue to suggest they are a long way from their employment goals and the inflationists will cite the higher earnings in the release as evidence that it's hard to find employees at the right price."


Meanwhile, according to BofA, the report leaves the Fed "to remain patient, slowly and carefully taking baby steps to set the stage for tapering but unlikely to send an explicit signal until the September FOMC meeting."


Maybe, Reid asks, you can have a relatively slow jobs recovery and inflation.



"If that does happen then the Fed will have difficult decisions to make at some point." 



On that, the DB strategist concludes that "next week's US CPI will be the most watched economic report of the year so far."

Jerome Powell might be done as a useful Federal Reserve Chairman.  Not that Fed Chairs provide a use that’s of any real value.  They mainly excel at destroying the wealth of wage earners and savers for the benefit of member banks.


But as Powell loses a grip on price inflation the business of supplying credit at a fixed rate of return becomes less fruitful.  Consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), is rising at an annual rate of 4.2 percent.  That’s well above interest rate of a 30 year fixed mortgage, which is currently 3.1 percent.

In the US, the first winners of the "vaccination lotteries" being adopted by a growing number of states - including West Virginia (which is offering guns, trucks & "piles of cash), California and a handful of others - are taking home life-changing money, all because they decided to get vaccinated.







And according to WSJ, the incentives that these programs create are already having a positive impact on the vaccination rate, which has finally eclipsed 50% of American adults. The program is also having some success in Hong Kong.

A proposed Chinese wind farm in Texas poses national security concerns, warned China-watcher and hedge fund manager Kyle Bass.







The Blue Hills Wind development in southwest Texas’s Val Verde County has attracted heightened scrutiny in recent months, with lawmakers and experts signaling concern that the Chinese project could be used as a cover for espionage and to disrupt the state’s power grid.


The proposed wind farm site is about 30 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border and near the Laughlin Air Force Base, the U.S. Air Force’s largest pilot training facility.

One of the most significant events of the last two decades has been largely memory-holed: the October, 2001 anthrax attacks in the U.S. Beginning just one week after 9/11 and extending for another three weeks, a highly weaponized and sophisticated strain of anthrax had been sent around the country through the U.S. Postal Service addressed to some of the country's most prominent political and media figures. As Americans were still reeling from the devastation of 9/11, the anthrax killed five Americans and sickened another seventeen.

During America’s first-ever national lockdown, thousands of unelected bureaucrats, as well as federal and state governments, assumed enormous powers not usually accorded to them.







They picked and chose which businesses could stay open without much rationale. They sent the infected into nursing homes occupied by the weak and vulnerable.


Their rules for prosecuting those who violated social distancing, sheltering in place, mask wearing or violent protesting often hinged on political grounds. Their spending measures on “infrastructure” and “health care” were excuses to lard up redistributive entitlements.

Think wage wars are only taking place among minimum wage workers, who (until September at least) are getting paid more from Uncle Sam to stay home and do nothing? Think again.


Amid numerous anecdotes of sticky wages at the high-end of the jobs spectrum, one stands out: as Bloomberg reports today, in September 2020, the Palo Alto-based Cooley law firm announced it was handing out $2,500 to $7,500 in one-time payments to associates. The bonuses came as the firm -  along with many others in the legal industry - realized it was both flush with cash and facing worker burnout during the pandemic.

The catalyst is well known: a furious, face-ripper of a rally in the heavily-shorted meme stocks, which pushed the Goldman Retail Sentiment Basket, (GSCBHTBR) i.e., the retail favorite stocks up +25% yesterday and up +61% over the last 7 sessions!

Isn’t is amazing how quickly things seem to change when it’s in the interest of those that think they run the world? For years we’ve been trying to get access to Hillary Clinton’s missing e-mails as Secretary of State but to no avail. However, at the most opportune time in the collapsing COVID story, Dr. Anthony Fauci’s emails are uncovered and broadcast to the world.


The same mechanism, FOIA, that Hillary has stonewalled us on for six years uncovers Fauci’s emails in six weeks?

Someone should put Elon Musk on notice: the legacy automakers have officially entered the EV sales fray.


And domestic U.S. automakers have officially hit the ground running.


Ford announced on Thursday that U.S. sales were up 4.1% to 161,725 units in May, while YTD sales were up 11.3%. The "everything bubble" created by Central Banks helped truck sales rise 11.6% over the same period and SUV sales to rise 48.6%. These numbers were despite the auto industry continuing to grapple with a semiconductor shortage - one that had even left Ford trucks stranded on the side of the road, waiting for parts, earlier this year.

It appears the Biden administration has realized their ambitious tax hikes have a snowball's chance in hell of passing, given the slim majority Democrats hold in both chambers of Congress - which include two serious moderates (Manchin and Sinema) and a parliamentarian who won't let them get away with forcing legislation through via reconciliation (a simple majority).


Now, according to the Washington Post, Biden has outlined a plan for $1 trillion in new spending financed through tax changes which would not focus on raising the top corporate rate - a major concession to Republicans who opposed an earlier proposal to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.

For about 1 in 4, Social Security provides at least 90 percent of their income.


How many retired workers are getting less than $1,000 per month in Social Security benefits? The question came up and I was curious enough to find the answer, and download the data into an Excel spreadsheet which I saved as a PDF that you can review here. Note that this data is for the 46.5 million retired workers only, and does not include benefits paid to survivors, spouses, disabled, etc.


This led to a deep dive into the basic numbers of Social Security beneficiaries and expenses, which are summarized in the chart below. Here are the basics:

A dangerous heatwave plagues much of the Western US this week as scorching heat pushes towards the east through the weekend and into early next week. 


Heat warnings and advisories are in effect from the California/Mexico border to Washington state, where temperatures anomalies are 30 degrees above normal in some areas. 


"Extreme heat in these locations will significantly increase the potential for heat-related illnesses," the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) warned.

By Vince Bielski, RealClearInvestigations


President Biden repeatedly insists that his infrastructure plan will create millions of jobs and labor unions will be the big winners. But interviews with economists, union leaders, government officials and trade groups as well as basic math suggest otherwise.


The once dominant trade and construction unions no longer have enough members outside of their strongholds on both coasts and in the Midwest to claim most of the projected infrastructure jobs. By some estimates, two-thirds of these jobs will go to nonunion workers who dominate the construction markets in most states.


Biden, in short, appears to be harking back nostalgically to an era of union…]]></summary>

Pouring more fuel on what was already today's dumpster fire of a market, Bloomberg reported that according to a memo it had seen, Jefferies told clients its prime brokerage arm will no longer allow the execution of short sells in meme stocks such as AMC, GameStop and MicroVision.


“Until further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options in GME, AMC and MVIS,” the memo noted. The firm will no longer allow the execution of short sells of those securities, the memo continued, noting that other stocks may be added to that list.


The news comes in a rollercoaster session for AMC which after plunging as much as 30% on news it was selling 11.55MM shares in an At The Market offering, reversed all losses after announcing it had completed the offering, gaining as much as 10% before again reversing the move and last seen down about 9% at $57. Expect much more drama here.

In a sign of just how frenzied the container market has become, a freight forwarder is reportedly paying $135,000 per day for a short-term charter of the S Santiago, a 15-year-old container ship with a capacity of 5,060 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).



“Charter rates for short employment … have gone out of control,” said Alphaliner in its new weekly report.



“Depending on the sources, the ship would have obtained anything between $100,000 and $145,000 per day, an absolute historic high. The name of the charterer has not been fully confirmed, although it is believed to be a forwarder.”

Authored by Adam Andrzejewski via RealClear Policy (emphasis ours),


New York City had more than 114,000 municipal workers earning $100,000 or more in 2019. That is up sharply from 76,166 employees with pay exceeding $100,000 in 2016.







Data comes a year before the pandemic hit and is the latest year available.


These were not just high-level employees like agency commissioners or deputy mayors. NYC employees included thermostat repairmen making up to $198,630; regular laborers hauling away $213,169; electricians taking home $253,132; and plumbers pocketing up to $286,245.


The cost of benefits would be additional and is not included in these figures.


These large paychecks are only sustainable because Congress bailed out New York City for $4.3 billion in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The federal bailout more than covered the overstated deficits of the city.


City officials estimated a $5.5 billion gap, but actual revenues came in $2.7 billion higher. Using $1.2 billion from reserves, and finding $1 billion in unspecified labor savings, among other things closed the budget gap.


Therefore, the federal money now exists for extra spending.


In December, Fitch Ratings downgraded New York City’s bond rating and issued a negative outlook. That was after Moody’s Investors Service lowered the credit ratings of both the state and city in October.

One of the disconcerting things I’ve been seeing again and again from all the major players in this new narrative like Lue Elizondo and Christopher Mellon is the absurd assertion that not only is it entirely possible that the unknown phenomena allegedly being regularly witnessed by military personnel are extraterrestrial in origin, but that if they are extraterrestrial they may want to hurt us.

To recap, last month US District Judge Dabney Friedrich struck down the CDC moratorium on evictions, finding that the agency had overstepped its authority - yet agreeing to block her own ruling from taking immediate affect in order for the Biden administration to launch an appeal, according to The Hill.

Authored by Andy Puzder via RealClearPolitics.com, 


In a speech last week introducing his proposed $6 trillion 2022 budget, President Biden claimed that the benefits of the Republican Party’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act “went to the wealthiest 1% of America.”


It’s not the first time he’s made this claim.


In his first speech to a joint session of Congress, Biden described the TCJA as a “huge windfall” for “those at the very top.” 


To right that wrong, he proposes getting rid of loopholes and raising the top tax rate from its current 37% to 39.6%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SoftBank-Backed Construction-Industry-"Transforming" Company Katerra Collapses After Billions In Investment

            
Oh how the mighty continue to fall.


Katerra, the construction giant that was backed by SoftBank, has officially told its employees that it is shutting down its operations. Katerra “had promised to shake up the construction industry with its efficient factories, prefab parts and modular construction units,” Bloomberg had reported on the company in the past.


But now the only thing it's shaking up are the lives of the 8,000 employees it had globally, as of last year, according to TechCrunch, who pointed out that the company had already struggled "to find a viable business in cheaply building properties for real estate developers".


The company was then beset by climbing labor and material costs associated with the pandemic (and perhaps now, the hyperinflation that's succeeding the pandemic). 


"So, you guys use a lot of lumber, or no?"


SoftBank tried to bail out the struggling company, offering $200 million on top of the billions it had already invested in the company, to buy a majority stake. But, not unlike the WeWork IPO, Katerra couldn't be saved. 


Bloomberg reports that the company is now likely going to walk away from "dozens" of projects it has already committed to. 


Among those being laid off are 117 workers in Seattle, according to The Seattle Times. The losses are expected to take effect on June 4. 


CEO Masayoshi Son had called Katerra one of his "regrets" in an interview with Barron's last month. The company had raised more than $2 billion since its founding in 2015.

A report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned that a recent labor shortage plaguing businesses nationwide is worsening, describing the situation as a “national economic crisis.”







The Chamber’s report released Tuesday found that the United States had a record 8.1 million vacant job openings in March—the last month where data was available—noting it was an increase of 600,000 from February.


But, the Chamber stressed that there “are approximately half as many available workers for every open job,” or 1.4 available workers per job opening, across the country “and the ratio continues to fall.” Compared with the previous 20 years, the…]]></summary>

The 71-year-old Netanyahu has long been dubbed "the magician" by supporters for his history of being able to politically survive time and again against multiple near-misses.

Four months after the Reddit crew sparked a historic market-wide short squeeze across a handful of small and mid-cap companies, which knocked out some of the most respected hedge funds in the world with Melvin Capital requiring a multi-billion bailout from Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen, the squeeze is back sending heavily shorted names like AMC, whose short interest we pointed out last week was off the charts...



AMC short interest pic.twitter.com/w9oIsRK7cK

— zerohedge (@zerohedge) May 25, 2021


... and which has exploded higher, a squeeze which has now shifted over to names such as Bed Bath and Beyond and various other small and mid-cap names.







Of course, there is no mystery what's behind this: just like in late January when the meme squeeze phenomenon first emerged, the common theme here is that all these stocks are extremely heavily shorted, and retail investors are seeking to squeeze the shorts once again and thus time with even more stimmy power.


To be sure, one look at the chart of the most heavily shorted names shows what's going on.







So, just like in late January, we have compiled a list of the most heavily shorted names. It may come as a surprise to some that the former leaders here, GME and AMC are not even in the top 30.


So which companies are? Below we have screened for the most shorted Russell 2000 names (based on SI as a % of float), and which we will use to constitute our latest and greatest short basket.







If the performance of our previous most shorted index is any indication, going long a market cap-weighted basket of these names - and especially the smaller, less liquid ones - could turn out to be the trade of the year, if not a lifetime.

Oil prices rallied on the day as signs of a demand recovery from the US to Europe stoke optimism among producers and analysts in the crude market, combined with waning hopes for an Iran nuke deal.


Oil is in “strong demand right now,” with economies around the world opening up, Daniel Yergin, the oil historian and vice chairman at consultant IHS Markit Ltd., said in a Bloomberg Television interview.



"Oil is bid on the Iran timeline to adding barrels getting kicked further into the future--sometime between August and the fall," says Bob Yawger at Mizuho.



After last week's across-the-board draws, analysts expected another week of demand dominance.

While crude stocks tumbled more than expected, gasoline and distillate stocks unexpectedly rose last week...

WTI hovered just below $68.80 ahead of the API print and barely budged on the mixed data...







“There’s plenty of room for upside here,” said Bob Yawger, head of the futures division at Mizuho Securities.


“Summer and the reopening of the economy is bullish for demand,” while “it looks much less likely we’ll have Iranian barrels any time soon than it did last week.”


But, the question now is whether oil prices can hold their gains "amid strong demand, despite plenty of downside risk on the supply side," said Robbie Fraser, global research & analytics manager at Schneider Electric, in a daily report.

The Department of Homeland Security on Friday issued a new warning bulletin, alerting Americans that domestic extremists may well use violence on the 100th Anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre. This was at least the fourth such bulletin issued this year by Homeland Security (DHS) warning of the same danger and, thus far, none of the fears it is trying to instill into the American population has materialized.

According to every career economist, market strategist and Fed lackey, inflation is transitory. The most important man on Wall Street disagrees.


Speaking at a virtual event hosted by Deutsche Bank, Blackrock CEO Larry Fink who manages more money than the Fed (over $9 trillion at last check) countered soothing talk that soaring prices are here and gone tomorrow, and said that investors may be underestimating the potential for a spike in inflation.



"Most people haven’t had a forty-plus year career, and they’ve only seen declining inflation over the last 30-plus years. So this is going to be a pretty big shock", Fink said, his warning falling on deaf ears.

The first thing any economist should do wen reading a budget proposal is to analyse the basic macro assumptions and the results presented by the administration. When both are poor, the budget should be criticised. This is the case of the Biden Budget Plan.







Same growth, a lot more debt and less employment.


According to the administration, the impact on growth of this budget will be negligible, as their own -and optimistic- estimates see no change in the slowdown of the U.S. economic growth trend.

Authored by Jamie Joseph via The Epoch Times,


Los Angeles is set ablaze up to 24 times a day. The cause? Thousands of homeless encampments...







This year, fires started in homeless encampments have accounted for 54 percent of the blazes battled by the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), according to officials—a sharp uptick compared to 2020.


As the county grapples with more than 66,000 people living on its streets, critics are pointing to the growing number of fires caused by the homeless as another indication that officials are mishandling the crisis. And in parts of the city where the homeless are concentrated, residents and business owners say their concerns are not being heard.

One suspects that historians and economists will consistently agree on one irrefutable fact: nations that allow their economies to bathe in red ink are destined to fail. This failure takes many roads and differs in timing, but massive, uncontrolled national deficits eventually reduce a nation state to being a pauper, a pariah -- and pathetic.


Enter Joe Biden's "American Jobs Plan," a $2.3 trillion spending scheme that takes some Americans' most fevered fantasies and wraps them inside an "infrastructure" label in an effort to convince Capitol Hill that the spending is all about roads and bridges.

The 41-year-old man, who was not named, was hospitalized in late April with H10N3 in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, located near Shanghai, according to China’s National Health Commission in a statement on its website.


The commission said that no other cases have been reported.

The move comes as Biden turns to "tent camps, convention centers and other huge facilities" which are operated by private contractors paid by the Department of Health and Human Services.

In January, 2020, when the World Health Organization insisted that COVID-19 wasn't transmissible between humans, and Dr. Anthony Fauci said that the risk to the American public from the virus was "low," officials at the National Institutes of Health were scrambling to perform damage control after a controversial - and now withdrawn - study suggested that there were HIV-like 'insertions' included in SARS-CoV-2.







The study, "Uncanny similarity of unique inserts on the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag," posited that segments of the virus's RNA had no relation to other coronaviruses such as SARS, and instead appeared to be closer to HIV.

You probably don’t need me to tell you that society is coming apart at the seams all around us.  If you live in a major city, you can just walk outside and watch it happen right in front of you.  Prior to 2020, social decay was steadily eating away at our society, but once the pandemic hit many of our societal problems greatly accelerated.  Even while the Federal Reserve was making sure that wealthy Wall Street investors were being taken care of well, poverty and homelessness were absolutely exploding in major cities all over the nation.  Meanwhile, an increasing number of Americans have been turning to drugs to cope with thei…]]></summary>

Update (2002 ET): The USDA has released an important update about the Biden administration's steps to mitigate potential supply constraints and price surges following JBS' ransomware attack. 



As noted earlier today by the White House, USDA is aware of the ransomware attack against JBS, which is affecting the company's operations, including its facilities in the United States. USDA continues to work closely with the White House, Department of Homeland Security, JBS USA and others to monitor this situation closely and offer help and assistance to mitigate any potential supply or price issues. As part of that effort, USDA has reached out to several major meat processors in the United States to …]]></summary>

Longtime 'bond king' Bill Gross has kept a low profile since his "retirement" from Janus Henderson, where he worked after leaving PIMCO abruptly in 2014 in a high-profile dispute with colleagues. While he emerged earlier this year to share the results of a recent Gamestop short, Gross has been making more appearances in the tabloids than in the business press recently thanks to a legal dispute with one of his neighbors.







But in today's FT, Gross returns with an editorial warning that the Federal Reserve and Treasury are injecting money into the economy so quickly that as the economy recovers from COVID-19, they're risking a dangerous snap-back in markets as investors reckon with the withdrawal of …]]></summary>

Last month, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed a bill into law that creates a commission to study the feasibility of creating a gold bullion depository in the Volunteer State.







A state bullion depository would not only create a safe place to store precious metals; it would increase the state’s financial independence. It could also facilitate the everyday use of gold and silver in financial transactions in Tennessee and set the stage to undermine the Federal Reserve’s monopoly on money.

The Washington Post has become the latest media outlet to reverse its earlier insistence that the Wuhan lab leak theory was a “debunked conspiracy theory.”







The newspaper published an article in February 2020 by Paulini Firozi labeling the explanation a “debunked conspiracy theory” but has now been forced to issue a retraction.



“Earlier versions of this story and its headline inaccurately characterized comments by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) regarding the origins of the coronavirus,” states the retraction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEC Blasted Tesla In May 2020 For Failing To Oversee Musk's Tweets

            
In previously undisclosed documents, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, securities regulators told Tesla last year that CEO Elon Musk's use of Twitter had twice violated a court-ordered policy requiring his tweets to be preapproved by company lawyers.







In letters sent to Tesla in 2019 and 2020, the SEC reportedly said tweets that Musk wrote about Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price hadn't undergone the required preapproval by Tesla's lawyers.


As a reminder, Musk had publicly mocked the SEC even after settling the previous fraud claims with the agency.







Specifically, The Wall Street Journal reports that the SEC told Tesla in May 2020 that:



the company had failed “to enforce these procedures and controls despite repeated violations by Mr. Musk.”



The letter, signed by a senior SEC official in its San Francisco office, added:



“Tesla has abdicated the duties required of it by the court’s order.”



This perhaps explains why Musk himself was quick to admit in May 2020 that "no", his twitter remarks were not vetted.


Given the fact that we are just discovering these details now - at least 13 months after they occurred - as far as we can see, nothing at all has been done to either re-enforce the SEC-ordered oversight by Tesla lawyers, or to slow Musk's roll in tweeting frequency and absurdity (cough Dogecoin cough)...



Is the SEC going to - wait for it - tell Tesla to preclear Musk's tweets (again)?

— zerohedge (@zerohedge) February 25, 2021


...we can only imagine how long it will be before some actual actions are taken... or enforcements hardened over the carmaker's incessant need to 'share'.

In a decision that echos the WHO's decision back in early 2020 to rename the novel coronavirus to "COVID-19", the agency has decided to change the names of the most prominent mutant strains of the coronavirus to letters from the Greek alphabet.







Using letters like Alpha, Beta and Gamma (instead of B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) to refer to the variants will make it "easier and more practical" to discuss them with non-scientific audiences, the WHO said in a statement. COVID strains believed to be more infectious are deemed "of interest" and "of concern" by the WHO. 



"While they have their advantages, these scientific names can be difficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting," the WHO …]]></summary>

By Joe Carson, former chief economist at Alliance Bernstein


In Q1 2021, the US economy registered double-digit annualized growth in nominal GDP, a rare occurrence. Yet, an even more rare event is that corporate operating profits did not increase in the quarter when GDP growth increased double-digits.


How can companies' operating earnings be flat when nominal growth is booming? How does the GDP measure of operating square with S&P 500 firms reporting substantial gains in Q1, far exceeding analysts' estimates?

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported that nominal GDP increased at an annual rate of 11% in Q1 2021. Since the Reagan boom of the early 1980s, the US only regis…]]></summary>

In a seeming repeat of the Trump admin attempt to impose a full naval blockade on Venezuela to prevent fuel and oil imports and exports, especially involving Iranian tankers, the US military is said to be actively monitoring two Iranian naval vessels which are believed headed toward Venezuela.


Washington has reportedly warned the Maduro government against receiving the warships, which likely have elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force members aboard. The two "rogue states" (as the US sees them) have become increasingly close especially under the prior four Trump years as they cooperated in circumventing US sanctions, and have grown militarily more cooperative.

Australia and New Zealand have managed to keep COVID cases and deaths at a minimum thanks largely to their isolated status, which has enabled both countries to "raise the drawbridge", so to speak, keeping out most foreigners since the start of the crisis.







But even with Australia's notoriously stringent COVID-19 restrictions, a few cases have managed to slip by. In the face of the biggest cluster uncovered in months, Melbourne and the surrounding Victoria State entered their 4th lockdown last week. Though it was only supposed to last a week, that could soon change as more cases are confirmed.

On Memorial Day, the media do their usual sacralizing of war. Instead, it should be a day for the ritualized scourging of politicians.


During the last 70 years, their lies have resulted in the unnecessary deaths of almost 100,000 American soldiers and millions of foreigners. And yet, people still get teary-eyed when politicians take the stage to talk about their devotion to the troops.

Former Trump National Security Adviser Micheal Flynn made an off-the-cuff statement over the weekend that a Myanmar-like military coup not only could happen, but "should happen" in the US.







Speaking at the Dallas "For God & Country Patriot Roundup," branded by Business Insider and MarketWatch as a "QAnon conference" (because a quilt with a "Q" on it was auctioned off at the event), Flynn was asked during a Q&A session "I want to know why what happened in Myanmar can’t happen here?"


To which Flynn - who spent 33 years as an Army intelligence officer - replied: "No reason. I mean, it should happen."

After it was revealed that the FBI pressured Flynn into pleading guilty amid threat of going after his son, leading the DOJ to drop its case against him (which a judge finally closed eight months later), Flynn has become an icon among former President Trump's most ardent supporters.


According to the New York Times, "He was one of the most extreme voices in Mr. Trump’s 77-day push to overturn the election," and suggested using the military to rerun the vote in key battleground states - which then-President Trump could have imposed martial law to enact.


"People out there talk about martial law like it’s something that we’ve never done," Flynn told Newsmax several months ago, noting that the military had taken over for civilian authorities dozens of times in US history.

India's second coronavirus wave finally crested during the month of May as the 7-day average declined steadily over the course of the month, while deaths remained stubbornly high until the second half. But even more than the numbers, the spread of a mutated COVID strain first discovered in India, a strain tagged with the handle B.1.617, has raised alarm as it spread around the world.







And now China is reacting to evidence of a recent cluster of cases caused by the Indian variant to further tighten China's border between India and their mutual neighbors.

Moscow had some stinging words for Washington which were also hilariously ironic on Monday, as both Putin and Biden look ahead to their in-person summit set for June 16 in Geneva. Warning of "uncomfortable" signals to come, the Kremlin indicated that high on the agenda would be a range of human rights and free speech issues in the United States, particularly the "persecution" of those behind the January 6 Capitol riot by the Biden administration. 


The words appear Moscow's ultimate trolling response to Biden remarks on Sunday wherein he vowed to confront Putin on egregious human rights abuses: "Of course, we will be ready to discuss everything, including problems that exist in th…]]></summary>

Local newspaper Yomiuri reveals Japanese authorities are mulling over expanding eligibility criteria, including a negative COVID-19 test or vaccination history, for fans before entering the Tokyo Olympics this summer. Once inside, spectators might be forbidden from eating, drinking, and cheering. 


Yomiuri said the government is considering that all spectators be required to show a negative COVID test within a week before attending the event that is set to run between July 23 and Aug. 8. 







Reuters quoted the government's top spokesman Katsunobu Kato, who told reporters that he's unaware of any decision on eligibility criteria.

Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has brought up a very interesting point regarding China's unwillingness to share evidence with western investigators looking into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.


During a Sunday appearance on CBS News "Face the Nation," Gottlieb noted that CCP scientists would have taken blood samples from three lab workers who were hospitalized with COVID-like symptoms in Dec. 2019 (one of whom's wife likely died of the disease).

With today being the US Memorial Day holiday to commemorate its fallen combat soldiers, it’s likely to be a quiet start to the week for markets. However, the US holiday provides a platform for some sober reflection on more contemporary forms of competition


First, a former PBOC official says the rapid rise in CNY against USD probably won’t last, and that the Chinese currency is “overbought”.

Over the weekend Senator Rand Paul and former CIA director and secretary of state Mike Pompeo both warned that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is still up and running, and that evidence points to involvement with the Chinese military in bioweapons research.







Appearing on Fox News, Paul told Jeanine Pirro that he is worried US funding is still being used by the lab to conduct biological warfare experiments.



“I’m very worried that this stuff still goes on and that the U.S. government’s been funding it,” Paul said, adding “We’ve got a lot of evidence pointing to this lab now,” as the origin of the virus outbreak.

North Korea has blasted what it's calling a "hostile policy" in the wake of the Biden White House lifting restrictions on South Korea's ballistic missile program, which is now authorized to develop missiles capable of traveling beyond prior limitations. 


During a May 21 US-South Korea summit the US side announced Seoul is now free to pursue missiles with unlimited ranges, but the statement out of a Pyongyang official said this will inevitably lead to an "acute and instable situation", according to the Associated Press. Previously the US imposed a limit of a 500 mile range (800km) on the south's missiles on concerns of a regional arms race.

The benefits set to lapse include not only the additional $300 weekly federal supplement, but programs for gig workers and others who typically don't qualify for aid "(Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, or PUA) and for the long-term unemployed (Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, or PEUC) in most cases," according to CNBC, which has provided this handy guide to states set to end benefits, and when:

To most people, “inflation” signifies widespread rising prices. Economists have long argued, as a matter of technical accuracy, that “inflation” denotes an increasing money supply. Frankly, though, most people don’t care what happens to the supply of money, but they care a lot about the prices they pay, so I’ll focus primarily on the numerous rapidly rising prices Americans are paying today.







Following are several examples of the current inflation:

On Monday, May 31, Americans from sea to shining sea will observe Memorial Day. However, veterans are quick to remind you: “It’s not about us.”



“Monday is not about us,” Sergeant J.O. Batten, Commander of VFW Post 8713 in Brooksville, Florida told The Epoch Times.


“It’s about the men on that wall out there. A lot of people don’t realize that.”



Batten, a United States Marine, served in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969.







“The wall” is a granite monument, which stands guard at the front door of VFW. It bears the names of a group of men known as “The Brooksville Eight,” men who were killed in action during the Vietnam War.

The title of our recently published mid-year outlook – Now the Hard Part – captures the conundrum market participants face: early-cycle timing, mid-cycle conditions and late-cycle valuations.







It is unusual to see this confluence, especially because it was only a little over a year ago that global risk markets were reeling and recording cyclical lows. Thus, despite our economists' call for strong global economic growth supported by the largest fiscal stimulus, the largest monetary easing and the highest consumer savings rates in post-war history, the investment recommendations from our strategists have a more subdued tone…]]></summary>

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday walked back comments made by the agency’s chief, who suggested earlier in the day that the federal government was “taking a very close look” at the idea of requiring vaccine passports to enter or leave the United States.



“Looking ahead to summer, Europe and other countries are going to open up. Could we see vaccine passports to travel internationally either into or out of the U.S.?” an ABC “Good Morning America” host asked Alejandro Mayorkas, head of the DHS.


“We’re taking a very close look at that,” Mayorkas responded.

A search is ongoing for three crew members reported missing from a roll-on/roll-off (ro/ro) vessel that sank off the coast of Japan early Friday morning.  The MV Byakko sank at about 2:40 a.m. local time after colliding with the chemical tanker Ulsan Pioneer just before midnight in the Seto Inland Sea, Reuters reported. The Byakko reportedly sank about 2.5 miles off the coast of Imabari.


Nine of the Byakko’s 12 crew members were said to have been rescued by the Japanese coast guard and nearby ships.

In a nationwide address, Yamina party leader and Netanyahu's former defense minister, Naftali Bennett said he had decided to join forces with the country's opposition leader, Yair Lapid in a “unity government" whose "unified" goal has long been removing Netanyahu from office.

Last June, eight guys in Brooklyn put their heads together, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, and came up with a scheme to steal strangers’ identities and take what didn’t belong to them.


Just a couple months before that—in the earliest days of the COVID-19 scare—Congress passed a $2.2 trillion bill called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. The money was supposed to go to the millions of isolated Americans who had their paychecks interrupted during the pandemic.

COT reports show the positioning of commodity futures. There is a COT report for every commodity (gold, silver, lean hogs, live cattle, sugar, corn, the S&P 500, US Treasuries, etc.).

That the era of stability has ended and a new era of increasingly chaotic volatility has begun is not on anyone's radar as a possibility.

The latest addition to the list is collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), which are created when a bank lends money to a less-than-creditworthy company and then bundles that loan with a bunch of similar loans into bonds for sale to yield-starved pension funds and bond funds.

Record low mortgage rates, low housing inventory, and a real estate frenzy have increased the amount of wholesaling conducted nationwide since the pandemic as many were lured in by YouTube tutorials.

Biden backed down on Nordstream 2 and, at The Davos Crowd’s insistence, he will back down on the JCPOA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US Military Plans To Harvest Solar Energy In Space, Beam It To Earth

            
The US Air Force (USAF) is experimenting with the idea to harvest space solar power that will be beamed back to Earth as usable energy. 


The US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) shared a video on YouTube describing how the solar power satellite Arachne would work. 







AFRL Director Brig. Gen. Heather Pringle, quoted by Breaking Defense, said the critical design review of Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research Project (SSPIDR) would be conducted this summer. 


SSPIDR aims to use an Arachne satellite that would convert energy generated from the sun to radio frequency and beam it down to a land-based antenna. Once the radio frequency hits the antenna, it will be converted to useable power. 


If SSPIDR is successful, it could one day give the US military a great advantage on the modern battlefield and an unlimited source of energy for forward operating bases. This will also allow for bases to power future weapons, such as lasers and rail guns. 


At the moment, the military requires massive supply chains and convoys to receive not just energy power generation equipment but also fuel to power generators at remote bases. 


"Ensuring that a forward operating base maintains reliable power is one of the most dangerous parts of military ground operations. Convoys and supply lines are a major target for adversaries," the narrator of a new AFRL video said. 





Well, this appears to be one way the military is attempting to "go green."

Ransomware has seeped into the mainstream consciousness thanks to the recent shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline.

Putin reportedly welcomed Lukashenko to the Friday meeting with the remarks: "Thank you for coming here, as we agreed even before the current outburst of emotions," He emphasized further, "Yes, it is an outburst of emotions," before saying, "But we have topics to discuss without these developments."

Market Review & Update


Finally, after a week of false starts, the “buy signals” kicked in, and the markets mustered a rally. As we stated last week:



“With markets deeply oversold on a short-term basis and with signals at levels that generally precede short-term rallies, the rally on Thursday and Friday was not unexpected. Notably, the S&P 500 held support at the 50-dma and rallied back into the previous trading range. 


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq triggered its short-term “buy signal,” which will likely provide some relative outperformance over the S&P 500. It will be important for the Nasdaq to hold above the 50-dma into next week“

For the better part of the past decade, Wall Street traders would end their week with at least a casual glance at JPMorgan's closely-followed cross-asset report written every week by the bank's top x-asset strategist, John Normand. But not any more: as Normand wrote in his May 21 note published last Friday, "this is my last research note and video, as I am moving on after 24 years." In his note, Normand discusses lessons "learned in over two decades with JPM Research, covering cross-asset strategy/asset allocation, Currencies, Commodities and Fixed Income" a period "which covers four business cycles, three US/global recessions and four financial crises (that didn't cause US recessions), plus hundreds o…]]></summary>

A federal appellate court on Thursday invalidated the racial and gender preferences in President Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act as unconstitutional. The Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit of Appeals ruled that provisions of that law, designed to grant preferences to minority-owned small-restaurant owners for COVID relief, violate the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law:

Let’s travel back in time to March of 2020, when predictions of mass death related to the new coronavirus started to gain currency. One study, conducted by Imperial College’s Neil Ferguson, indicated that U.S. deaths alone would exceed 2 million. 


The above number is often used, even by conservatives and libertarians, as justification for the initial lockdowns.


“We knew so little” is the excuse, and with so many deaths expected, can anyone blame local, state, and national politicians for panicking? 







The answer is a resounding yes.

It was literally raining oil in St. Croix a couple weeks ago - and not in the good "newly discovered oil"-type way most people know from movies and TV.


The oil falling from the sky was the result of a "flare incident" that took place Limetree Bay refinery; the incident shot oil up into the sky and it was carried west by the wind before raining down on parts of the island, according to CNN. 


As a result of the incident, the US Environmental Protection Agency ordered an emergency, 60-day shutdown of the plant, citing an "imminent risk" to public health, the report says. The incident sent sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide into the air. 58 year old resident Dyline Thomas said: "The smell wa…]]></summary>

China launched an automated cargo rocket hauling supplies for the country's new space station late Saturday from the tropical island of Hainan in the South China Sea. 


A Long March-7 Y3 rocket carrying the Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft blasted off at 8:55 pm local time from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, state-run media Global Times reported.

The Tianzhou spacecraft is tasked with refueling the Tianhe space station core cabin for maintenance in orbit and also provides living necessities for future crewed missions at the space station. 







The Chinese space agency expects 11 launches through the end of this year to deliver two more modules for the Tiangong Space Station, additional supplies, and a three-member crew. Today's launch marks the second within a month. 







Apart from launch and eventual docking at the new space station, the rocket itself is set to fall back to Earth in an uncontrolled manner. Well, that's at least what happened earlier this month after the launch. There was no statement from Beijing about reentry plans for the rocket. 


Beijing isn't part of the International Space Station (ISS), primarily due to the U.S. The ISS has been in low Earth orbit for a little more than 22 years and could reach its lifespan by the end of this decade. Russia has already announced it would be withdrawing from the ISS to build its own.

A new grading policy, put forth by the Baltimore City School Board, Tuesday, will allow students who are struggling and failing classes to move up to the next grade level due to the virus pandemic, according to local news Fox 45. 


Instead of holding back students, Baltimore City Public School System's (BCPSS) new grading policy will push up struggling students who failed classes during the pandemic and have their educational status tested during the fall semester to determine what skills they missed during virtual learning classes. 







Chief Academic Officer Joan Dabrowski said the new policy is intended to "avoid the punitive approach of failing students."

The US dollar is on the verge of breaking down to the lowest level since 2014. 







This is not all that surprising. After all, the US money supply continues to grow at a rapid pace relative to other countries and quantitative easing is likely to continue at full pace through the end of 2021. Meanwhile, other countries like the UK, Canada and others are already telegraphing rate hikes. Not only that, but the US budget deficit as a percent of GDP – which has a tight correlation with the level of the US dollar index – is set to explode through 2022 and beyond.

Technical problems onboard a massive crude tanker Friday led to the shutdown of Turkey's Bosphorus Strait. 


The vessel veered off course in the Bosphorus Strait, a narrow waterway that divides the city of Istanbul and connects the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.







The crude oil tanker RAVA disrupted vessel activity for three hours Friday as tugboats had to intervene and prevented the vessel from plowing into the shoreline of Istanbul's Yenikoy district. The entire operation took eight tugs and five other vessels. The straight was reopened later in the day.

Misinformation, i.e., wrong claims innocently made, and disinformation, i.e., wrong claims willfully made, have long consorted to create propaganda, a distorted worldview designed to achieve some political goal.







The lines between those lies have so blurred that only a neologistic portmanteau, dismisinfoganda, fully captures recent reality.


Like an old hip-hip song, let’s break it down:




	
dis = intentionally wrong claims (lies)

	

	

	
mis = unintentionally wrong claims (error)

	

	

	
dismis(s) = denying a claim without empirically engaging it

Democrat lawmakers in particular have long pushed for massively increased federal aid for public housing across the country following a decades-long decline amid a perpetual funding crisis that's left large mid-20th century urban housing complexes derelict and crumbling.


Nowhere has the crisis been felt more than (as expected) New York City, where most of the some 325 housing projects owned by New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) are dilapidated to the point of becoming uninhabitable, for years if not decades facing interminable problems like mold and rats, water leaks and damaged roots, as well as no heat, elevators going out, and lead paint hazards.

One of the fringe benefits of Washington’s stimulus program has been inflated stock portfolios.  This has delivered a great boon for certain state governments.  In Connecticut, for example, a state that taxes capital gains as regular income, this year’s budget surplus is projected to be $470 million.


That’s quite an achievement.  Especially when you consider the state’s rainy-day fund will hit an all-time high of $4.5 billion.  Federal coronavirus stimulus is also bringing $6 billion into the state.


Yet for the greedy fellows in the Connecticut state legislature the budget surplus is not nearly enough.  They want to soak the rich for the noble purpose of helping people.  Lawmakers are proposin…]]></summary>

NASA's Curiosity rover captured a stunning snapshot of what appears to be a cloudy day in the Arizona desert, but this picture is actually a cloudy day on Mars. 







NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA JPL) released multiple images documenting cloudy days in the thin, dry atmosphere of the Red Planet. 


"Clouds are typically found at the planet's equator in the coldest time of year, when Mars is the farthest from the Sun in its oval-shaped orbit. But one full Martian year ago – two Earth years – scientists noticed clouds forming over NASA's Curiosity rover earlier than expected," NASA JPL's press release read. 


Curiosity has taken about 21 photographs of the strange Martian clouds over Gale Crater.

Lifetime real earnings of the median male worker declined by 10% from those who entered the US labor market in 1967 to those in 1983, or roughly a loss of $136,000.







A study on Lifetime Earnings in the United States over Six Decades is worth a close look.


The study shows the United States shows a "wage stagnation of average earnings and a rise in income inequality since the 1970s." The charts are based on US Social Security Administration (SSA) records over 57 years.


The charts are more than a bit confusing unless one carefully dives into the details.

A Trump-era commission tasked with combating “false narratives about the American Founding” has urged the Biden administration to drop its proposal to fund history and civics programs that promote critical race theory or related curricula “under the misleading name of ‘anti-racism.'”







Former President Donald Trump holds an executive order he signed at the White House in Washington on June 26, 2020 to establish a 20-person Advisory 1776 Commission under the Department of Education to promote “patriotic education.” The commission was terminated by President Joe Biden on Jan. 20, 2021.

As demands to cancel the Tokyo Olympics intensify, Japan on Friday extended a state of emergency in Tokyo and eight other prefectures until June 20 as hospitals struggle to handle a rise in COVID-sickened patients.







The state of emergency had previously been slated to end on May 31, but strains on the medical system are still too intense for Japanese officials to be entirely comfortable with the current situation. Japan has seen a record number of COVID patients in critical condition in recent days, even as the number of new infections has slowed. This has prompted worries about infectious new COVID "variants" spreading in the country with the start of the Olympics just a few weeks away.

Following Friday's bombshell revelation that Dr. Anthony Fauci has supported 'gain of function' research, even arguing that the "risks" (which include a worldwide pandemic caused by a potential lab accident) were outweighed by the potential benefits to humanity, it's worth revisiting a vote that quietly took place earlier this week in the Senate.







Sen. Paul has been arguing with Dr. Fauci about the merits of the research and whether they're outweighed by the risks of deadly lab leaks for weeks now. He memorably took the good doctor to task during a hearing of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee hectoring over his prior support for gain of function research in China, to …]]></summary>

Many industries were throttled, bludgeoned, beaten, and even destroyed during the lockdowns of 2020. It will be years before the damage is repaired, and some of it is irreparable. 







One industry that did not suffer was that which was and is devoted to writing scientific papers on the Coronavirus. Talk about boom times! A report from October 2020 estimates that 87,000 studies have been written and published in some form on the topic. It’s surely more than 100,000 by now. These writers do not produce content out of the goodness of their hearts. It’s the old rule: subsidize something (thank you Bill Gates) and you get more of it.

Election season in Mexico has always been a dangerous game, with politicians regularly knocked off by cartels seeking to install 'friendly' candidates by process of elimination. 







Since the start of the electoral process in Sep. 2020, eighty-eight politicians have been murdered nationwide, according to TeleSur. The most recent, Citizens Movement (MC) candidate Alma Barragan, was shot to death while driving by unidentified assailants, just a few hours after she attended a campaign event. Barragan marks the third murdered candidate in Guanajuato alone ahead of the region's June 6 election.

Among the "new" things that Americans will notice during this year's post-Covid Memorial Day will be skyrocketing prices at the pump.


Drivers are in store for the highest prices in seven years this summer, Reuters writes this week, as retail gas prices are the most expensive since 2014 at about $3.04 per gallon. 







And those prices have nowhere to go but up, as a year's worth of pent up demand for leisure activities, vacation and summer sun come to fruition over the next three or four months. This could drive up prices even further during peak travel weeks during the summer.

Joe Biden is cruising, in a happy-place few politicians reach. Outside of a few grumpy right-wing outlets he faces almost no hostile press questioning, political threats within his own party are minimal, and his approval rating, if one believes the latest Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, hovers at an astonishing 64%.





Biden has the press paper-trained to a degree we haven’t seen in modern times. Not even at the height of the media’s drooling love affair with Barack Obama — a phenomenon I confess I was part of — did we ever see such enthusiastic, reflexive backing of White House messaging. The Biden press even reverses course on a dime when needed, with the past weeks being a supreme e…]]></summary>

It’s dawning on many investors that our post-Covid financial problems may not be as easily solved as Washington claims...







The latest clue that trouble is brewing has come from the sudden and dramatic arrival of inflation. On May 12, it was revealed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) had risen 4.2% year-over-year, the fastest pace since 2008.


Some tried to downplay concern by pointing out that the gains resulted from the “base effect” of comparing current prices with the artificially depressed “Covid lockdown” prices of March and April of last year. But that ignores the more alarming trend of near-term price acceleration.

Update (1330ET): President Biden just released the much-leaked and strawman'd Fiscal Year 2022 budget request to Congress on Friday, the first formal budget of his presidency.


The topline budget request for 2022 is $6 trillion. But of this, as we detailed below, only $300 billion is new spending requested for next year. Instead, the vast majority of it will be spent on programs the government is obligated by law to fund, like Medicare, Social Security and interest on the national debt. 



“Put together, this budget is an agenda for robust, durable economic growth and broadly shared prosperity,” said Shalanda Young, Biden’s acting White House budget director.

This historic liquidity injection by the Treasury and not the Fed (which continues to this day to inject $120BN in liquidity monthly from its ongoing QE) was, as we put it, a form of backdoor QE, which would push asset prices higher and depress real rates.

We may have a little more insight as to reports yesterday that Tesla was pre-paying for semiconductor parts to secure supply.

But a new report overnight from DigiTimes Asia sheds more light on the situation, leading us to believe that Tesla could simply be short of supplies and desperately in need of parts to be able to hit production targets.

With Tesla falling out of favor in China, one domestic EV maker, Li Auto, is predicting a tailwind.


The Chinese Tesla rival, which produces the Li One SUV, predicts that its sales will rise at least 15% in from April to June as a result of Tesla running "foul of angry Chinese customers," SCMP reported on Wednesday. 


The company's Li One SUV competes with Tesla's Model Y. It is an extended-range sport-utility vehicle (SUV) that is priced at 328,000 yuan (US$51,316), according to the report. 


Li Auto said on Wednesday that Q2 deliveries would come in between 14,500 units and 15,500 units, up from estimates of 12,579 in the first three months of the year. Li reported a 13% decli…]]></summary>

An Atlanta city councilman running for mayor, who last year supported a measure to reduce city police funding by tens of millions of dollars, had his car stolen by children on Wednesday, he and police confirmed.







Councilman Antonio Brown had been attending a ceremony in northeastern Atlanta at 12 p.m. Wednesday when several children jumped into his vehicle and drove away, he said.



“You don’t immediately think, ‘Oh, these kids are going to steal my car,’” Brown told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, referring to the incident, adding that the thieves appeared to be children, although one of them “acted as though he had a gun…]]></summary>

Lockheed Martin and General Motors are teaming to develop the next-generation lunar vehicle for NASA's upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon. 


The Artemis program aims to land astronauts on the lunar surface by the midpoint of the decade. For exploration purposes, astronauts will need "surface mobility that is critical to enable and sustain long-term exploration of the lunar surface. These next-generation rovers will dramatically extend the range of astronauts," a Lockheed press release read. 







The new lunar vehicle "may allow astronauts to explore the lunar surface in unprecedented fashion and support discovery in places where humans have never gone before," the defense contract continued.

Despite essentially cutting off all international travel in an attempt to "raise the drawbridge" and keep out COVID-19 after mostly purging it from their society, Australia is entering its fourth COVID-inspired lockdown in Melbourne, the country's second-largest city. The lockdown began Thursday and was set to remain in place for a week for Melbourne and the rest of Victoria state after a new cluster of cases was uncovered, yielding 26 new infections, including one person who was sent to intensive care, the AP reports.


Another 10K people have reportedly had some form of contact with those infected.

The COVID-19 pandemic is ending with mass vaccinations. So is the national quarantine. The rioting, looting, and arson that began in the summer of 2020 is finally sputtering out.


The acrimony over the 2020 election is fading. Trump Derangement Syndrome became abstract when Donald Trump left office and was ostracized from social media.


In other words, the American people are slowly regaining their senses after the epidemic of mass hysteria that gripped the nation last year.







But many Americans wonder whether what Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and the hard left wrought last year will last when the nation is no longer gripped by 2020 madness.

By now everyone has seen some iteration of this chart (most recently discussed here), which shows that whereas stocks are generally flat over longer periods of time during the regular "cash", or day session, they tend to melt up during the overnight hours when liquidity is far lower and when the "pajama trades" come out and play.







And while there is no single, widely accepted reason for this "overnight drift", the post-closed meltup phenomenon has been one of the most popular and recurring strategies in equity markets, with many traders selling spoos when the day session begins and then re-buying at the market close in pursuit of scarce alpha.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon went scorched earth on President Biden's tax plan, which would raise the current corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, arguing that it would result in capital flight out of the United States.







"The tax increase is actually four times what the tax decrease was from 2017," Dimon said during a Thursday virtual hearing before the US House Committee on Financial Services. "You all know the phrase the devil is in the details, well the details here are all that matter, not the top line of 28%."


"If you want to have a healthy, growing, competitive America against the rest of the world, you need a global, competitive tax rate," Dimon added. "It would be detrimental to a lot of companies, it would push a lot of capital overseas."





Dimon cast doubt on the Biden tax plan earlier this month, calling it 'a little crazy,' however today's comments mark the strongest pushback yet from the top banker.


"We’re just throwing money. It doesn’t work," Dimon said in a recorded interview for the JPMorgan general membership meeting on May 6, adding "I’m concerned about how the money’s going to be spent."


"We already waste tremendous sums of money."

A Russian Navy surveillance ship parked in international waters off Kauai, an island in the Central Pacific, part of the Hawaiian archipelago, has delayed a Missile Defense Agency missile test, according to Honolulu Star-Advertiser. 


The US Pacific Fleet confirmed Wednesday that it "is aware of the Russian vessel operating in international waters in the vicinity of Hawaii, and will continue to track it through the duration of its time here." 


The ship has been operating in international waters just 13 nautical miles west of Kauai for several days. The vessel is not broadcasting an automatic identification system signal. 



"Through maritime patrol aircraft, surface ships and joint capabilities, we can closely monitor all vessels in the Indo-Pacific area of operations," US Pacific Fleet's statement continued. 



U.S. Naval Institute News first identified the presence of the spy ship, indicating it was a Russian Navy Vishnya-class auxiliary general intelligence (AGI) ship Kareliya (SSV-535). Honolulu Star-Advertiser then expanded on this and said the vessel is in the vicinity of the Pacific Missile Range and has "delayed" a missile test. 







The question remains: Why does a Russian signals intelligence vessel sit off the coast of Kauai? Is Moscow sending the Biden administration a message of new strength in the Pacific?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Retail Investors Storm Back Into The Market: This Is What They Are Buying

            
It was less than than three weeks ago when we first noted that retail participation in stock trading had seemingly collapsed after a wild start to the year, with JPMorgan reporting that US retail investors share in equity trading declined sharply in March after a strong January and February, and a record high share of 28% in December.







And while April and the start of May exhibited a similar continued decline in both retail participation and performance of "retail favorite" stocks, which underperformed the broader market by 8% since mid-March, things have changed dramatically in the past two weeks and as Goldman notes in a new piece discussing the "Recent performance of stocks with high levels of retail activity", stocks with high retail trading volumes have outperformed by 5% since May 12th, with half of this outperformance occurring yesterday (Wednesday). 


Echoing JPMorgan's observations, Goldman then notes that while declines in daily trades at retail brokers showed significant declines last week (DARTs), leading to fresh concerns that retail trading activity was on the decline - with many going so far as to conclude that retail investors were no longer investing their stimmies - this too appears to have been the wrong conclusion, as the rise in retail stocks yesterday and especially today, when both GME and AMC have soared...







... suggesting it may be too early to call an end to elevated retail activity.







So what are retail investors buying? Based on Goldman's “small-lot trading” analysis, these are the 50 stocks where retail was the most active yesterday in shares and options.







Not enough? Here are the stocks with high “small lot” trading activity in Options

Today it was revealed that "about two dozen investment advisers" that included Balyasny Asset Management and a unit of Blackstone bought put options on ARK's Innovation ETF during the first quarter. Blackstone bought puts on 1.3 million ARKK shares and Balyasny acquired puts on 436,500 shares.

Authored by Jeff Harris via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace & Prosperity,


You would think that during the worst Pandemic since the 1918 Spanish Flu life insurance companies would be hedging their bets to avoid major losses from Covid-19. 


I haven’t written a life policy for several years so I was wondering what was going on?


I called one of the brokers I deal with that interacts with hundreds of big life insurers to get an inside look into how the Covid crisis has changed their business.





Imagine my surprise when she said it was pretty much business as usual!


Last year when the hysteria was just getting ramped up she did say the companies temporarily tightened up underwriting and reduced the amount of coverage they would offer. But as time went by and the hard data came rolling in those same companies went back to business as usual.
I asked her specifically if life insurers wanted a Covid test as part of the underwriting process and she said none that she was aware of.


Hmm, that’s pretty interesting isn’t it?


The most lethal pandemic in decades descends on the globe with deadly mutations taking millions of innocent lives and the life insurance companies couldn’t care less.
I also asked if the cost per thousand of coverage had increased due to Covid and again she said no.


Rates were pretty much the same as they were before the Covid Pandemic ravaged the earth.


Life Insurance companies are very risk adverse. 


They don’t like losing money to unnecessary claims.


The fact they’re treating Covid as a nonevent should be an indicator that something is very wrong with the whole narrative.

President Biden, possibly most famous for his - and his son's - business dealings in China coming into question whilst running for the Presidency, may wake up this week to find out from one of his top advisors that he's now a China hawk.


That is, if you ask Kurt Campbell, the U.S. coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs on the National Security Council. 


Campbell said this week that the U.S. was "entering a period of intense competition with China as the government running the world’s second-biggest economy becomes ever more tightly controlled by President Xi Jinping," according to Bloomberg.

Real Vision managing editor Ed Harrison welcomes Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, back to the Daily Briefing to update viewers on how the bond market is reacting to the re-opening of the economy and the sustained dovishness of the Federal Reserve. Bianco analyzes how the Fed’s bias towards employment within its dual mandate is impacting inflation expectations and bond yields, and he and Harrison discuss today’s jobless claims within that context as well as ballooning budget deficits and central bank balance sheet expansion.

Looking at the scramble for repo, interbroker dealer Wrightson ICAP said on Thursday morning that it saw Reverse Repo volumes rising to around $470 billion Thursday, though the risks are “still tilted to the high side.”


They were, because moments ago the Fed announced that at 1:15pm some 50 counterparties (up from 46 on Wednesday) parked $485.329BN in reserves with the Fed (in exchange for the generous rate of 0.000%), which was up $35BN overnight, up $134BN in the past wee…]]></summary>

Authored by Mark Glennon via Wirepoints.org,


Most Illinoisans are unaware, but their General Assembly is poised to pass a resolution for a state constitutional amendment, the consequences of which are hard to overstate. It would vastly expand union power, permanently, particularly public union power that is already extreme.







Limited media coverage so far characterizes the amendment mostly as an attempt to permanently ban right-to-work and lock in current worker protections. That would be bad enough, since the majority of states are now right to work including nearby competitors Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana and Iowa. And Illinois is already an outlier in how much power it has given to …]]></summary>

The calm of a sunny May afternoon in Taiwan was broken by what the Nikkei describes as a crescendo of smartphones buzzing due to a national emergency alert: electricity blackouts were coming due to a malfunction at a power plant in the south of the island. People had no time to prepare. There were more than 30 reports of people being trapped in elevators half an hour after the warning in the capital city.

Summary: Chinese equities were rallying 3.6% today on signals from the Chinese government to curb inflationary pressures from rising commodity markets reducing inflation expectations and boosting the earnings outlook. US equities are currently valued at a valuation premium to Chinese equities which suggest historically that Chinese equities could outperform over the next 26 weeks. The two country's technology sectors are equally valued on a 2-year forward basis on EV/EBITDA but with a valuation skew on Chinese technology mega caps making them more attractive on valuation. The long-term growth outlook is better for Chinese technology companies and thus we expect the market to beg…]]></summary>

While many of the SPACs he has sponsored have seen less than stellar returns, Chamath Palihapitiya and his VC firm, Social Capital, are doing just fine.  Palihapitiya has been a player in Silicon Valley for years, but thanks to the SPAC boom, 2020 was a breakout year for the former Facebook employee. Not only did he rake in profits for his firm and his investors, but SPACs have changed the nature of the IPO process







Somewhat lost in all the excitement of the SPAC boom is the fact that Social Capital is a VC firm that has invested in more than 70 companies during the past decade, which has been a lucrative one for Silicon Valley. Social Capi…]]></summary>

Teen climate zealot Greta Thunberg raised some eyebrows last week when she tossed an f-bomb in a video she posted Saturday to commemorate the International Day of Biological Diversity. (Something I've admittedly never heard of.) 



"Our relationship with nature is broken," Saint Greta flatly stated.


"But relationships can change. If we don't change, we are f**ked."




”Our relationship with nature is broken. But relationships can change. When we protect nature - we are nature protecting itself.”

Dozens of people are missing in north-western Nigeria after a boat carrying 200 capsized on Wednesday, according to Reuters, citing a state spokesperson.



"The boat was ferrying about 200 passengers" coming from the neighboring country of Niger, said Yahaya Sarki, a spokesperson for the governor of Kebbi.


"Their locally made wooden boat capsized mid-water," Sarki said. "Bodies are still being recovered. We can't ascertain the number for now."



The boat was reportedly overloaded when it suddenly snapped into two in the middle of the Niger River. 







Reports of how many people on board vary from news agency to news agency—some say between 160 and 200.


Authorities in Kebbi State told the BBC that first responders had been dispatched to the scene to search for survivors. 



"A rescue operation is underway, but only 22 survivors and one dead body have been recovered," a local official reportedly said.



Qasimu Umar Wara, a resident of Wara town, told Reuters the passengers were returning from a newly-discovered gold vein in Niger. 



"They usually go there in the evenings and return to Wara in the morning," he said. "Most of them are petty traders, food vendors and the local miners."



The wooden boat is reportedly rated for 80 passengers, and the accident is likely due to overloading.

Since Bill and Melinda Gates first announced their divorce earlier this month, barely a day has passed without some unflattering new revelation, as the American media apparently scrambles to compensate for all those years where it treated Bill Gates with kid gloves.


It's bad enough that Melinda reportedly divorced Bill over his insistence on maintaining ties with Jeffrey Epstein, something that has stoked speculation about whether Gates might face more sexual harassment allegations (sure enough, reports have emerged claiming he was essentially pushed out at Microsoft over improper behavior involving a female subordinate) or that he might be caught up in the…]]></summary>

Following calls last summer from groups such as Black Lives Matter to “defund the police,” a number of city officials are now walking back statements to go through with cutting funding to law enforcement due to surges in crime levels.


The Minneapolis City Council several months ago voted to approve $6.4 million more in funding to the police department, coming after a number of councilmembers last year pledged to completely abolish the department.

A professor with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine has said that there is a general dismissal of the fact that more than half of all Americans have developed natural immunity to the coronavirus and that it constitutes “one of the biggest failures of our current medical leadership.”







Dr. Marty Makary made the comments during a recent interview, noting that “natural immunity works” and it is wrong to vilify those who don’t want the vaccine because they have already recovered from the virus.

According to a report from The New York Times, US troops are expected to be out of Afghanistan by early to mid-July, well before the September 11th deadline set by President Biden.


Unnamed US officials told the Times that Washington’s allies are also expected to be out by July, although Germany is apparently struggling to keep up the pace. US Central Command on Tuesday said the Afghanistan withdrawal process was about 16 to 25 percent complete.

The US Federal Reserve is insisting that recent increases in the price of food, construction materials, used cars, personal health products, gasoline, and appliances reflect transitory factors that will quickly fade with post-pandemic normalization. But what if they are a harbinger, not a "noisy" deviation?







Memories can be tricky. I have long been haunted by the inflation of the 1970s. Fifty years ago, when I had just started my career as a professional economist at the Federal Reserve, I was witness to the birth of the Great Inflation as a Fed insider. That left me with the recurring nightmares of a financial post-traumatic stress disorder. The bad dre…]]></summary>

Amid the fifth and what's expected to be the final round of Iran nuclear talks in Vienna, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has voiced that time is running out on reaching an agreement given the Islamic Republic has already reached bomb-building capability in terms of enriched uranium purity levels. 


IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told Financial Times that Iran has reached uranium purity levels that "only countries making bombs are reaching" after routinely ramping up enrichment since Trump pulled out of the Obama-era JCPOA back in May 2018.

The long-awaited, though partial, release of a memorandum from the Justice Department this week left many “frustrated,” as predicted by the Washington Post, in Washington. The reason is what it did not contain.  Critics had sought the memo as the “smoking gun” to show how former Attorney General Bill Barr scuttled any obstruction charges against Donald Trump.


Instead, the memo showed the opposite. 







The staff of the OLC actually found that the allegations did not meet the standard of obstruction even without any defenses or privileges related to Trump’s office.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It Reeks Of Deflation After Second Stellar Treasury Auction In A Row

            
After yesterday's blockbuster 2Y auction which pushed bond yields sharply lower and which we said was an indication that the inflationary storm has passed with bond traders no longer expecting any rate hikes for the foreseeable future, moments ago the stench of deflation was positively rancid after today's $61BN 5-Year auction was just as almost as solid as Tuesday's auction.


Printing at a high yield of 0.788%, the 2Y auction stopped 5.5bps below April's auction and also stopped through the When Issued 0.794% by 0.6bps, the first stop through for the tenor since Jan 2021.


Meanwhile, and like yesterday, the Bid to Cover jumped, rising from 2.31 last month to 2.49 today, the highest since Sept 2020 and obviously well above the six-auction average of 2.34.


The internals were also stellar with Indirects taking down a whopping 64.4%, the highest foreign award since August 2020 and far above the 57.9% recent average. And with Directs taking down a lower than average 14.9%, Dealers were left holding 20.8% of the auction, the lowest since August.







Overall, a stellar bond auction, and one which together with yesterday's 2Y auction suggests that demand for tomorrow's 7Y issuance will be vastly greater compared to the dismal 7Y bond sale in late February when the bellybuster auction was nearly a flop and sparked a major bond and stock market selloff.

The U.S. Department of Commerce says it will seek to double tariff rates on most Canadian softwood lumber, angering home builders. New rates vary by company. West Fraser goes from 9 percent to 11.4 percent, Canfor from 4.6 to 21 percent, Resolute Forest from 20.3 to 30.2 percent, and J.D. Irving from 4.2 to 15.8 percent.


The overall increase is from 9 percent to 18.32 percent.


Home builders, who had been urging for a removal of tariffs, expressed their disappointment.

If you want to act in movies or on television in Hollywood, you must be a member of the Screen Actors Guild. That’s why the accession of a “SAG” card is such a momentous achievement for actors. It means they’re Hollywood legal as it were.







So why does acting professionally require union membership? The answer is very simple: SAG wants to prevent those yearning to be stars from flooding the market, and subsequently bidding starting wages down to zero.

Ever since China started allowing American money managers access to the hundreds of millions of middle class Chinese investors and savers via "joint ventures" with domestic firms, some of the biggest US buy-side firms, including BlackRock and Vanguard, have already launched their Chinese operations.


And now, after months of cajoling local regulators, it appears Goldman Sachs has just won approval to launch a wealth management venture of its own alongside ICBC, one of China's largest banks, the FT says.


So pretty soon, the Chinese elite will have the opportunity to join their American peers by becoming Goldman clients.

Authored by Jonathan Maze via RestaurantBusinessOnline.com,


Subway franchisees recently started pushing the company to dramatically reduce the ongoing fees they pay the company in a bid to keep more of them in business.







But Subway is moving in the other direction. The sandwich giant’s newest franchise agreement increases their ongoing royalty payments by 25%, numerous sources told Restaurant Business. The result would send higher what many say is an already unusually high royalty rate at a time when the chain is closing more than 1,000 locations a year.


Currently, the Milford, Conn.-based franchisor charges operators a base royalty of 8% of a store’s revenue—or $8 for every $100 in sales a location generat…]]></summary>

Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wants to end what is effectively legalized insider trading by members of Congress by barring them from trading individual stocks ever again.







Warren first attempted to push through similar legislation with the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act she introduced in 2018 and then again in 2020. Both bills unsurprisingly died in the Senate Finance Committee, which Warren sits on.


The renewed push comes as several members of Congress have come under recent scrutiny for profitable stock trades in recent months, according to Business Insider. The include Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC), Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) and former Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WTI Bounces Back Above $66 After Inventory Draws Across Entire Complex

            
Oil prices ended marginally lower after a choppy day of investors tempering expectations of an early return of oil exporter Iran to international crude markets (bullish) and US virus cases falling rapidly ahead of Memorial Day travels (bullish) battling with the overall weakness in economic data and slop in US equity markets and lower bond yields (bearish).



"Oil prices... remain at high levels as the high season for oil demand is approaching and as restrictions are lifted in much of Europe and the United States," said Louise Dickson, oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy.



The swings in crude and product stocks in the last couple of weeks have been noisy thanks to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown. This week we should start to put that behind us, although product stocks may still be impacted.


API




	
Crude -439k (-1mm exp)

	

	

	
Cushing -1.153mm

	

	

	
Gasoline -1.986mm (-1.1mm exp)

	

	

	
Distillates -5.137mm (-2mm exp)

	


Analysts expected inventory draws across the board this week, and they were right with Gasoline stocks down notably more than expected for the 7th straight week...

WTI hovered around $65.90 ahead of the API data and pushed back above $66 after the print.








"Crude prices are in wait-and-see mode until the fifth round of negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal are done," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, noting "Energy traders need to know how much Iranian crude is going to hit the market."



Iran may have some 69 million barrels of oil in floating storage waiting on tankers to travel to buyers when U.S. sanctions on its crude oil exports are removed, estimates from E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers cited by Bloomberg showed on Tuesday.

Let's explore quantum computing, problems it might solve, and what it will do to current security protocols and blockchain.







What is a Quantum Computer?


The New Scientist answers the question What is a Quantum Computer?



Classical computers, which include smartphones and laptops, encode information in binary “bits” that can either be 0s or 1s. In a quantum computer, the basic unit of memory is a quantum bit or qubit.


For instance, eight bits is enough for a classical computer to represent any number between 0 and 255. But eight qubits is enough for a quantum computer to represent every number between 0 and 255 at the same…]]></summary>

What started as a birthday party in Huntington Beach, California, quickly descended into chaos over the weekend. 


A TikTok video promoting a birthday party went viral, and thousands of people showed up on the beach and in the streets Saturday night. Riot police were called as the unruly crowd launched fireworks and threw rocks and bottles. An emergency curfew was implemented through early Sunday with 150 arrests. 







A TikTok post (now taken down) called Adrian's Kickback by user "adrian.lopez517" swelled to more than 2,500 people on Saturday night. In the days before the meetup, the post went absolutely viral, gaining more than 200 million views on the app.

There was a ton of hype last week when Ford Motor Company unveiled its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck. As of Friday, Ford secured more than 44,000 reservations for the new truck. 


Ford's first all-electric truck is expected to have a targeted range between 230 and 300 miles depending on the version the customer chooses. Ford said the truck could haul up to 10,000 pounds. 







Auto blog Jalopnik points out that Ford failed to release data on how hauling or towing would affect range last week.

Despite relentless positive promotion by the media and political elites, support for Black Lives Matter in America has dropped to a two year low.







An essay written by academics Jennifer Chudy and Hakeem Jefferson published by the New York Times analyzes how support for BLM soared to +20% in mid-2020 but rapidly dropped to only +5% – which is where it was in mid-2019.


The authors note that the figures serve to contradict “the idea that the country underwent a racial reckoning.”

Economist John Williams, founder of ShadowStats.com, says the Federal Reserve has painted itself into such a tight corner with the economy it really has only two choices.  Williams says it comes down to “Inflation or Implosion.”







What would happen to the financial system if the Fed stopped printing massive amounts of money for stimulus and debt service?  Williams explains,

The news comes after 4,600 "members of the Notre Dame community" signed a petition urging college president Fr.

Thanks to its very name - renewable energy - we can picture a time in the not-too-distant future when our need for non-renewable fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal will vanish. Indeed, the Biden administration has announced a breakthrough target of 2035 for fully eliminating U.S. reliance on those non-renewable fuels for the generation of electricity. That would be accomplished by “deploying carbon-pollution-free electricity-generating resources,” primarily the everlasting power of the wind and sun.

Behind door number 1 we have China (i.e. Skeletor), and a relentless barrage of crypto FUD meant to distract from the disastrous reception of the digital yuan in hopes that Beijing can, after almost a decade of trying, finally talk bitcoin down to zero (narrator: it can't).

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Below is my column in The Hill on the recent decision of a federal judge that the Biden Administration was engaged in racial and gender discrimination in the administration of the pandemic relief under the American Rescue Plan Act. It is a question that is now being raised in a variety of federal programs under the Biden Administration.







President Biden has spoken out often, eloquently and passionately against the “ugly poison” of discrimination and racism in our government. So a ruling by a federal district court in Texas this week was particularly jarring: Judge Reed O’Connor found that the Biden administration engaged…]]></summary>

Via SchiffGold.com,


Inflation came in hot in April. Initially gold sold off on the news. But over the following week, there appears to have been something of a pivot in the market. Gold and the dollar both started behaving as one would expect in an inflationary environment. Peter Schiff said it looks like investors are starting to worry the Fed won’t fight inflation after all.







The markets have been by and large operating on the assumption that the Fed would stick to its playbook and tighten monetary policy to deal with increasing consumer prices. But Peter has been saying there is no way the Fed could fight inflation if it wants to. Inflation is propping up the economy. If the Fed raised rates and…]]></summary>

The Biden Administration is discussing hiking corporate taxes to pay for the proposed infrastructure spending package. While the goal is to ensure the “rich pay their fair share,” a look at history suggests changing tax rates will have very little impact on economic outcomes.

The fallacy of tax cuts,

	

	

	
Why tax cuts wouldn’t change corporate behavior; and,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New York City Is Back: At Least 30 People Shot Over The Weekend

            
New York City is officially back: almost 30 people were shot in New York City this past weekend - and that number was only up until about 2PM on Sunday. 


29 victims in total had been struck by gunfire by early evening Sunday, according to the New York Post, with one reported fatality. 


“These kids are having running gun battles and innocents are getting shot,” one veteran NYPD officer told the Post. “Nobody is interested in hearing how many shots are fired but if people knew how many shootings occurred where there are no victims — it’s by the grace of God."


Among those struck by gunfire over the weekend were a Manhattan federal prosecutor, Mollie Bracewell, who was dining outside in Brooklyn’s Prospect Heights, and Benjamin Bustamante, an innocent bystander walking nearby. 







The weekend hadn't even ended before one officer said "there were just two more right now", referring to additional shootings late Sunday. 


Shootings took place at Beach 30th Street and Seagirt Boulevard in Far Rockaway, Queens, among other locations throughout the city.


Two people were shot in that area after a "gang dispute" spilled out of a nearby park, the report says. 


And if "diversity" in your violent crimes is a major concern, as we know it probably is for Mayor De Blasio, it should be noted that in addition to the shootings, there was a fatal stabbing in Northern Brooklyn and a man who was beaten to death in the Northeast Bronx over the weekend as well.

Submitted by Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research


The inflation of the 1970s/early 1980s is a big topic just now, but a deep dive into the historical CPI data shows the world was very different then. The CPI peak in 1974 felt awful because food/clothing was 33 pct of the index and prices were up 8-12 pct. Those items are just 14 pct of CPI now. May 1980’s 13-14 pct CPI inflation was driven by high mortgage rates, no longer even used in CPI. Bottom line: look forward, not backwards, and consider energy stocks, gold, “B”, and even US stocks as inflation hedges.

Back in December, vol-specialist hedge fund One River Asset Management surprised its peers when long before Elon Musk arrived on  the scene, it became one of the first major asset managers to disclose it had purchased $600 million in bitcoin and ethereum and said it would own more than $1 billion in cryptos in early 2021. It wasn't along in this pioneering effort: Brevan Howard Asset Management co-founder Alan Howard had taken an ownership stake in One River Digital and was helping provide the company with backend trading services. Another prominent backer was British hedge fund Ruffer, which last December also revealed that 2.5% of its total AUM were in bitcoin.

What followed was a thorough critique from Rosenberg, who just a couple of months ago was warning that rising Treasury yields would soon push the market to a "breaking point," of what he sees as flaws in the market's pricing of lasting inflationary pressures.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced this weekend that he will not get vaccinated against COVID-19, explaining that he already contracted the virus last year and has “natural immunity.”







Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, said that he has not seen evidence proving the vaccine is more effective than having survived the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, otherwise known as the novel coronavirus, so he won’t get the shot.



“Until they show me evidence that people who have already had the infection are dying in large numbers, or being hospitalized or getting very sick, I just made my own personal decision that I’m not getting vaccinated because I’ve al…]]></summary>

Confirming that "selling in May" is there for a reason, virtually every bank has turned cautious if not outright downbeat on the market following a blockbuster earnings season when despite record earnings beats, the S&P is down compared to where it was a month ago. So now that Wall Street is back to its favorite activity of "explaining" events after the fact, here is Goldman strategist Chris Hussey listing the three key "grey rhino" events the market is grappling with.


As Hussey writes in the "end of week" market intel note, "gray rhino" risks have proliferated around markets this week, helping to sustain the tepid return range that the S&P 500 has been stuck in all of May (now down 0.2% mtd). Incidentally, for t…]]></summary>

The world’s worst disaster in a century killed 7.1mm-12.7mm across the planet. The total continued rising. No one knew exactly when it would end, only that the poorest nations would bear the brunt. They always do. European and Asian countries lost more citizens than they had since WWII. The US lost more than in any war. Children fell behind. Economic costs spiraled, leaving each nation’s finances forever changed. Monetary and fiscal policy merged in the West. Inflation reappeared. Despots tightened their grip. America’s president was voted out.

Glenn Kelman, CEO at Redfin, spoke with Bloomberg Radio's Denise Pellegrini on Wednesday about the state of the US housing market. He said the latest surge in home prices could subside. 


Kelman said the housing market is a frenzy, with most houses selling above the asking prices, which has never happened before. 


After record gains in the first quarter, some home prices are likely to stall. 


Nationwide, the median existing-home sales price rose 16.2% in the first quarter to $319,200, a record high in data going back to 1989, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Apples-to-apples, consumer price inflation nowadays is running close to the high inflation readings of the late 1970s. That should be a red flag for policymakers as monetary decisions are focused on actual outcomes, not forecasted. But reported inflation statistics do not show the 1970s inflation-style inflation because they no longer include actual house prices.


The old consumer price index included house prices in measuring the owner's housing cost, whereas the present-day price index base owners' housing cost on an arbitrary, non-market rent measure. The only way to make a price series strictly comparable over time is to use the s…]]></summary>

The weather in London this week has been rainy while sunny, which feels like a fair description of current sentiment, as we’ve been discussing our mid-year outlook with investors this week. There’s a wide range of views out there at the moment, with the noisiness of the data giving everyone something to hang their hat on. In short, it’s the perfect time to step back and debate the longer-term outlook.

Earlier this month, just hours after Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) dragged Anthony Fauci over pandemic misinformation - and the fact that Fauci's NIH funded risky collaborations at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - the nation's top virologist (and highest-paid government employee) furiously backpedaled over the origins of the pandemic in what we can only assume was an effort to redirect attention from his own culpability.







Recall that since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, Fauci parroted CCP talking points - insisting that the virus couldn't possibly have come from a Chinese lab.

Authored by Tom Luongo via Gold, Goats, 'n Guns blog,


Last week both Martin Armstrong and Alistair MacLeod wrote about the changes to the Basel III rules and how they will greatly affect the physical and paper gold markets if implemented in their current form.


MacLeod’s article from last week is an excellent primer on the definitions and inner workings of the rules, the gold market and the changes to the rules.  The short redux is that the advantage to using unallocated accounts, savings accounts which are linked to gold by holding futures contracts, will end.


We’ve discussed parts of this in the past.  The process of creating fake supply to control the price of gold is on the line with these rule changes.

A prominent crypto analytics firm has issued a new report suggesting the Islamic Republic was able to successfully weather the Trump-era sanctions storm of the past few years by generating up to a billion dollars a year through mining cryptocurrencies. 


Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic concluded that a whopping 4.5% of all global bitcoin mining takes place in Iran alone. The Iranian government itself has acknowledged these attempts to beat the near total economic embargo on the country, which has been in effect and progressively ramped up since Trump pulled out of the Obama-era JCPOA nuclear deal in May 2018.

The cost of living numbers prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are highly misleading. Currently, the government understates inflation by using a formula based on the concept of a “constant level of satisfaction” that evolved during the first half of the 20th century in academia. This extended into the BLS re-weightings sales outlets such as discount or mass merchandisers with Main Street shops. Those promoting this change claimed it was simply another way to measure inflation and it still reflected the true cost of living.

It's never just one thing. This week Elon Musk, China, and pipeline cyber attackers all contributed to another crash, but, as Decrypt's Jeff John Roberts details below, there's cause for optimism.


It began with Elon Musk bashing Bitcoin, and ended with a renewed crypto crackdown in China. Those came as book-ends to a spate of other bad news in cryptoland, including a stomach-churning market crash and anger over Bitcoin's role in facilitating a massive cyber attack on an east coast oil pipeline. All of this saw Bitcoin limp into the weekend well below the $40,000 mark as the entire crypto industry licked its wounds.

Transitory or not transitory, that is the question.


The challenges from cracking supply-chains and the resulting strain on production and inventory are being felt widely. If you are looking to furnish a home, you have probably dealt with major delays in the delivery of your new sofa and may instead be sitting on beanbags. If you are looking to buy a car, you might be walking out with the sticker price and the wrong color. And good luck if you are trying to rent a car: if only Hertz had waited a year to file for bankruptcy it would be worth tens of billions today.

Market Review & Update


After another rough start to the week, the bulls finally showed up and flipped our “money flow” indicators back to a buy signal. As we stated last week:



“Well, that follow-through failed to occur.Not only did the “buy signal” not trigger, but the market also broke down through the previous consolidation range. As I said, it did not work out as planned. The last exposure we took on is now pressuring the portfolio momentarily, but we should benefit from the turn if we are correct.”

New policies will artificially deflate “breakthrough infections” in the vaccinated, while the old rules continue to inflate case numbers in the unvaccinated.
