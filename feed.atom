Update (2000ET): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday that it will convene an "emergency meeting" of its advisers on June 18th to discuss rare but higher-than-expected reports of heart inflammation following doses of the mRNA-based Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.


The new details about myocarditis and pericarditis emerged first in presentations to a panel of independent advisers for the Food and Drug Administration, who are meeting Thursday to discuss how the regulator should approach emergency use authorization for using COVID-19 vaccines in younger children.

While Tesla's Cybertruck remains in limbo somewhere and Lordstown Motors is on the brink of failure, Ford Motor Company's F-150 Lightning pre-order count continues to surge. 


Three weeks ago, Ford unveiled the F-150 Lightning, an all-electric truck, delivering 563 horsepower and 775 lb.-ft. of torque. In the first 48 hours of release, the company received 44,500 pre-orders, according to CEO Jim Farley. 







Now, the pre-order count has reached 100,000 and continues to climb, according to Engadget. The F-Series line is America's best-selling truck for more than four decades. Millions of loyal Ford customers would never buy a Chevy, nevertheless, a Tesa or some other startup with a limited track record. 


By comparison, since 2019, Tesla's Cybertruck has accumulated over 1 million Cybertruck reservations. Ford has a much larger following than Tesla and could surpass reservations. 


Besides Ford's loyal customer base, spanning generations, President Sleepy Joe gave the car company free press last month when he was seen driving around in the vehicle on a closed course. 





"This sucker is quick," Biden said at the press conference. 


Reservations require a $100 refundable deposit. Ford has said the F-150 Lightning deliveries should begin in the spring of 2022. The Cybertruck is expected to be released in late 2022 but really, who knows. 


Those who made reservations for the Ford electric truck will only have to wait about 10-12 months until delivery. Meanwhile, those who made Cybertruck reservations have been waiting for a couple of years.

“Take away this pudding; it has no theme,” is a comment attributed to Winston Churchill, when a disappointing dessert was put in front of him.


Writers have used Churchill’s remark to describe a foreign policy that lacks coherence or centrality of purpose.


For most of our lifetimes, this has not been true of the United States. The goal of our foreign policy has been understandable and defined.


From 1949-1989, it was Cold War containment of the Soviet Empire and USSR.


Ronald Reagan believed in a “rollback” of communism, once telling an aide that his policy might be summed up as: “We win. They lose.”

A growing body of indicators point to Biden's vaunted plan for a full Afghan troop exit by Sep.11 being anything but a true and full final "exit". First, as we described earlier the Pentagon is thinking up ways to leave a significant security "footprint" which defense officials say is necessary to protect the sprawling embassy in Kabul. There's also talk of "counterterrorism support" directed from outside the country, which is said to be one among a "range of options" to soon be presented to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

A South Korean designer has created a ‘third eye’ that allows people to constantly look at their cellphones in the street as a warning to “smartphone zombies.”







Paeng Min-wook’s ‘The Third Eye’ is basically a sophisticated robotic eyeball that users strap to their forehead which warns them if they are about to bump into something.


“Paeng’s invention uses a gyro sensor to measure the oblique angle of the user’s neck and an ultrasonic sensor to calculate the distance between the robotic eye and any obstacles. Both sensors are linked to an open-source single-board microcontroller, with battery pack,” reports Reuters.

The pace at which conditions are changing is catching a lot of people off guard.  Here in the United States, we have been in a low inflation environment for most of the past four decades, and so many Americans don’t even have a frame of reference for what a highly inflationary environment looks like.  But now we are facing an inflation crisis that is unlike anything that we have seen since the Jimmy Carter era in the 1970s.  In response to the COVID pandemic, governments around the world have been borrowing and spending colossal mountains of money, and global central banks have been absolutely flooding their respective financial systems with new cash…]]></summary>

Journalist Jeffrey Toobin, who was suspended by CNN and fired from The New Yorker after he was caught masturbating on a zoom call last October in full view of colleagues, has been allowed back into the fold at the failing cable news network following a six-month period of 'reflection and growth.'







Hilariously, he had to sit there as CNN host Alisyn Camerota rang the shame bell behind him - then explain his side of it.


"...you were caught masturbating, on camera. You were subsequently fired from that job after 27 years of working [at the New Yorker], and you since then have been on leave from CNN," said Camerota, adding "What the hell were you thinking?"


Toobin acknowledged that he had been "deeply moronic," and his actions were "indefensible," adding that he's spent the last seven "miserable months" trying to be a better person, "in therapy, trying to do some public service, working at a food bank, working on a new book..."


Good to know what it takes to compel Toobin to engage in charitable acts. We can only hope he washed his hands before dealing with people's food.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Melvin Capital Among Hedge Funds Losing $6 Billion On Latest Meme Squeeze

            
"Fool me once, shame on... shame on you. Fool me... you can't get fooled again," were the infamous words of former President Bush and we suspect that Steve Cohen protégé Gabe Plotkin is reflecting on those stoic words as he looks back at his fund's performance in May.


Plotkin's Melvin Capital - infamously blown-up by a retail rampage during January's WSB Raid on heavily-shorted stocks - was joined by another fund, Light Street Capital, run by Glen Kacher (a Tiger Cub) in suffering significant losses as the sense of deja vu all over again in markets sent the most-heavily-shorted 'Meme stocks' soaring to even higher highs once again in May.







As The FT reports, hedge fund losses just from betting against five popular meme stocks - GameStop, Bed Bath & Beyond, AMC, BlackBerry and Clover Health - total about $6bn since the start of May, according to the data firm Ortex Analytics.


It appears the bailout of Melvin Capital (which after sustaining a $4.5bn loss in January got $2.75bn in new cash from Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Ken Griffin’s Citadel) was used to maintain his big shorts... and suffer a Sisyphean loss on his shorts once again.


Perhaps more notably, Peter Hillerberg, Ortex’s co-founder, said funds had recently reduced their short positions in meme stocks but that short interest remained “at very high levels”.


The FT reports that Melvin is now down 44.7% YTD (against the S&P's +12%) with $11 billion AUM; and Light Street is down 20.1% YTD with $3.3 billion AUM.


Both firms declined to comment...

Another quarter, another record high in (mostly 0.01%er) household net worth.


The Fed's latest Flow of Funds report released at noon today showed the latest snapshot of the US "household" sector as of March 31 2021, which confirmed that one year after the biggest drop in household net worth on record when $8 trillion was wiped out in Q1, 2020, in the 1st quarter of 2021, the net worth of US households soared by $5 trillion, or 3.8%, to a record $136.9 trillion. 







This means that over the past 12 months, US household net worth has increased by:

Some banks, awash in deposits, are encouraging corporate clients to spend the cash on their businesses or move it elsewhere. It's a strange case of "No More Cash Please".



U.S. companies are holding on to billions of dollars in cash. Their banks aren’t sure what to do with it. Some banks are encouraging corporate customers to consider alternatives. 


Top of mind for many big banks is a rule requiring them to hold capital equivalent to at least 3% of all assets. Worried about the rule’s impact during the pandemic, the Fed changed the calculation i…]]></summary>

Senator Rand Paul blasted Dr Fauci Wednesday, labelling him “an elitist” who believes Americans are not smart enough to make their own decisions about their health.







Appearing on Newsmax, Paul noted “I think it’s this — it’s one-size-fits-all and his idea that the regular people aren’t smart enough to make these regular decisions. So he just wants to treat everybody the same.”



“The one-size-fits-all strategy that everybody must get vaccinated ignores the science,” the Senator continued, adding “It’s mostly that he’s not telling the truth once again because he is an elitist, and he thinks we can’t handle the truth.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next Week's Heat Wave To Bake Californians 

            
June is typically the month the wildfire season in California begins. The state is already battling an extreme drought, and the first heat wave of the season hit last week. The risks of another heat wave are increasing for next week. 


The hottest and most fire-prone months are nearing as a second heat wave of the season could arrive as early as next week. 


How the season turns out may depend on the immediate climate in the state. Extreme heat and drought are several factors that may produce dry fuels and eventually spark fires. 


Forecast temperature anomalies daily are expected to jump for the southern part of the state by Tuesday/Wednesday and then the whole state by Friday. In many parts of the state, temperature anomalies, the difference from an average, or baseline, temperature, could be +14 degrees. Forecasts suggest Bakersfield and Fresno could reach triple digits. 







Prospects of the next heat wave come as the Drought Monitor (dated June 3) shows much of California, nevertheless, the West Coast, is experiencing some level of drought. 







California could be headed for a dangerous wildfire season with conditions already parched. 


Further, we want to monitor power prices in the state as grid demand could overwhelm supply, and power companies could issue rolling blackouts to conserve power or prevent wildfires.

Ground service providers drowning in shipments delivered by airlines are responding to massive gridlock at Chicago O’Hare by permanently relocating some warehouse operations outside the property  to increase capacity in what could increasingly become a model at major U.S. airports that haven’t prioritized investment in cargo facilities.







Alliance Ground International (AGI), with stations around the country, and local ground handling agent Maestro International Cargo this month are both opening large, off-airport transfer facilities to enable faster pickup of import cargo, which currently can take up to six days to retrieve after an aircraft’s arrival.

The Fed has indicated that it does not see its expected inflation surge in the coming months as pointing to longer-term pressures. Many investors are sceptical, but do not have a framework from which to push back against the Fed’s optimism that it can manage a "gentle inflation overshoot."


Here we argue that looking at trimmed mean inflation is a straightforward way of assessing whether an inflation surge is broad-based or narrow. So far, we find small indications that these broad-based inflation indicators are rising, but nothing conclusive. This assessment could change in the coming months.

As Yared writes, "supply shock to oil prices have had a significant impact on inflation expectations on three occasions over the past half century: in the mid 70s, the mid 80s and the mid 10s." However, unlike the infamous price explosions of the 70s and 80s, in the latest episode the "shale oil revolution" resulted in a significant positive supply shock to oil markets which led OPEC in 2014 to defend its market share rather than oil prices.

Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


In the latest show of US support for Taiwan, a group of US senators flew to the island on a military aircraft on Sunday, a trip that drew sharp condemnation from Beijing.


Senators Dan Sullivan (D-AK), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Chris Coons (D-DE) arrived in Taiwan aboard a C-17 Globemaster III cargo plane to announce the US was donating 750,000 Covid-19 vaccines to the island. According to Reuters, US officials typically visit Taiwan in unmarked private jets.

It comes as no surprise to readers that dozens of Baltimore City businesses, located in the Inner Harbor, in a stretch called "Fells Point," are threatening the new city government, run by Mayor Brandon Scott, with not paying their taxes because they're "fed up and frustrated" with the outburst of violence. 


In a letter titled "Letter to City Leaders From Fells Point Business Leaders," addressed to Mayor Brandon Scott, Council President Nick Mosby, Councilman Zeke Cohen, Madam State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, and Commissioner Michael Harrison, the 37 restaurants and small businesses are threatening to stop paying city taxes and other fees until "basic and essential municipal ser…]]></summary>

Authored by Kalev Leetaru via RealClearPolitics.com,


Who is receiving more attention on television news since the inauguration, President Joe Biden or former president Donald Trump?


The graph below shows the total mentions of President Biden across CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and BBC News London since Biden's inauguration day. Fox News has mentioned him the most, though even BBC News London has mentioned him nearly a third as often as CNN and MSNBC.







In contrast, the graph below shows that Fox News has covered former president Donald Trump far less than CNN or MSNBC. Look closely and you will notice that CNN and MSNBC have actually mentioned Trump more than Biden.







The graph below compares the two presidents since Biden's inauguration, comparing mentions of Biden (blue) against Trump (orange).







On MSNBC, former president Trump has received 129% of the coverage of President Biden, followed closely by CNN's 118%. On BBC News London, Trump has received 83% of Biden's mentions, while on Fox News Trump has received just 55% as much coverage as Biden.

It's also calling for an "immediate" halt to the legislation's progress as it goes to the House.

The Pentagon is touting that it's already successfully withdrawn more than half of American forces from Afghanistan, which means it's on a withdraw pace significantly ahead of Biden's Sept. 11 exit deadline.


"U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) estimates that we have completed greater than 50% of the entire retrograde process," the command announced Tuesday. And in terms of the massive logistical feat of removing military hardware after a two-decade occupation and build-up of bases, the military statement added that it's removed the equivalent of approximately 500 C-17 planeloads of material while also removing 13,000 pieces of equipment.

For over a year, there has been one fact that has been repeated in literally thousands of news stories: former Attorney General Bill Barr ordered the clearing of Lafayette Park on June 1, 2020 to allow former President Donald Trump to hold his controversial photo op in front of St. John’s Church. 


From the outset, there was ample reason to question the claim echoed across media outlets. As I noted in my testimony to Congress on the protest that month, the operation was clearly a response to days of violent and destructive protests.

That's because the Securities and Exchange Commission, headed up by Gary Gensler, has signaled that it plans on seeking to revise the rules that govern the stock trading plans, which are usually set up ahead of time to allow insiders to sell stock on a schedule. 


The plans have drawn scrutiny because there is no required disclosure when they are set up, despite many companies choosing to disclose the plans, and because they can be modified or canceled.

Surely at this point, we have to be imagining things, right? 


We have reported twice on Tesla uber-bull and well known talking head-of-hair "investment advisor" Ross Gerber's propensity for taking out government loans despite boasting on Twitter of how rich he was and how well his advisory firm was doing.


Back in July of 2020, we first pointed out that Gerber's firm, Santa Monica-based Gerber Kawasaki, was among the many firms nationwide to take PPP money. His firm took out a total of $515,458 in PPP funds via Wells Fargo.







The irony, of course, came from the fact that on April 27, 2020, just 6 short days before his firm's loan was approved, Gerber virtue signaled to the #resista…]]></summary>

Update (1426ET): El Salvador has become the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender after Congress passed President Nayib Bukele's proposal to embrace cryptocurrency. With bitcoin legal tender, just as the dollar, the country has set its sights on attracting miners. 


After all the clamoring about "greening" bitcoin mining, Bukele has offered miners "cheap 100% clean, 100% renewable, 0 emissions" energy. In fact, the president said the state-owned geothermal electric company LaGeo SA de CV will offer miners geothermal electricity powered from "our volcanos."

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


We're getting a real-world economics lesson in rip-your-face-off increases in prices, and the tuition is about to go up--way up.







Inflation will be transitory, blah-blah-blah--I beg to differ, for these reasons. There are numerous structural sources of inflation, which I define as prices rise while the quality and quantity of goods and services remain the same or diminish. Since the word inflation is so loaded, let's use the more neutral (and more accurate) term decline in purchasing power: an hour of your labor buys fewer goods and services of lesser quality than it did a decade ago or a generation ago.

Leslie Wexner, former founder and CEO of L Brands and well known former pal of Jeffrey Epstein, has offloaded about $500 million worth of stock this year. In a filing posted Monday, Wexner revealed he sold $327 million in shares of L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret, bringing his total for the year up to about $500 million.


The sales come after Wexner revealed that he and his wife would be stepping down from the company's board, according to Bloomberg.


The company's stock is up about 600% since hitting a 5 year low in March 2020. Though Wexner had sold stock in the past to the tune of between $100 million and $200 million annually, his sales accele…]]></summary>

Now, the SEC is finally considering changing the rules of how stocks are priced and traded to stop exchanges from incentivizing brokers (nowadays, particularly retail trading brokerages that have seen an explosion of activity in the past couple of years).

The Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Monday that noncitizens who have been granted temporary humanitarian relief from deportation cannot use the process known as “adjustment of status” to obtain lawful permanent residency in the United States without leaving the country. 







The court ruled in Sanchez v. Mayorkas that adjustment of status is reserved for those who were inspected at the border and admitted to the United States by an immigration officer, thus disqualifying the majority of those granted Temporary Protected Status.

With the latest heat wave subsiding in the northeastern U.S., after several days of dangerously high temperatures above 90 degrees, power prices skyrocketed as tens of millions turned down their thermostats. 


According to Bloomberg, electricity prices in New England tripled on Monday from a year ago. Since the weekend, a heat wave blanketed the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast but will subside by midweek. 


Gary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy, said energy demands are way "above normal" for this time of year because of increasing air-conditioning use. New England's grid operator could reach its summer peak in June instead of August, typically the hottest part of summer.


Monday's highs were 90-95 degrees in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area to New York City to Boston. 


Grid operator PJM Interconnection LLC, a regional transmission organization serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, issued a hot weather alert Monday. PJM requested owners of transmission lines and power plants to delay maintenance. 


On-peak electricity prices for Bloomingdale, Massachusetts, energy prices per megawatt-hour spiked on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. 







Peak energy prices for New York City also spiked. 







The heat wave is expected to dissipate by mid-week as Mid-Atlantic and Northeast temperatures will be around average or slightly below normal as a cold front rolls in through the weekend.

Seventy-six percent of U.S. adults say they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or plan to be, a number that has been stable over the past three months but is higher than in late 2020 and early 2021.







As of the May 18-23 survey, 60% of U.S. adults report they have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 4% have been partially vaccinated, 12% plan to be vaccinated and 24% do not plan to be vaccinated.


Among those not planning to be vaccinated, 78% say they are unlikely to reconsider their plans, including 51% who say they are "not likely at all" to change their mind and get vaccinated. That leaves one in five vaccine-reluctant adults open to recons…]]></summary>

Ben THE Kaufman summarizes:



Media: "The FBI hacked Bitcoin and can take anyone's funds."


Reality: The pipeline hackers didn't have the Bitcoin in the first place but kept it in a remote server the FBI could access with subpoena.


Media coverage is mostly lies at this point.



Which raises the following point (h/t Jordan Schachtel):



So the "hackers" brought down the largest pipeline on the east coast...

Things aren't going so well for Vice President Kamala Harris during her Guatemala trip, where as we observed earlier she went full Trump mode in a speech before Guatemalan press: "...I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States Mexico border: Do not come, do not come," she said.


Simultaneously NBC News published a sit-down interview between Harris and news anchor Lester Holt which took place during the trip. He pressed her on why she hadn't visited the border and that's where things quickly got testy...





Given she was recently "put in charge" of the crisis, Holt had asked simply whether she had any near future plans to visi…]]></summary>

Talks between President Joe Biden and Sen. Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV) - lead GOP negotiator on infrastructure legislation - have ended with no resolution, according to Bloomberg's Josh Wingrove. The negotiations, held via teleconference between the White House and a small group of Republican senators, were weighed down by deep disagreements over what actually constitutes 'infrastructure,' with Republicans using the dictionary definition of roads and other public works, and Democrats expanding it to include just about anything they want it to mean.

The story about Wuhan’s “wet market” is taking on water. 







We’ve moved well past the “trust but verify” stage. We’re now in the “don’t trust a damn thing they say” stage.


In this case, “they” refers mostly to the Chinese Communist Party.


But the public’s mistrust has spread to our own government’s public health experts, and to much of the Western media, as well.


We still don’t know where the COVID-19 pandemic originated, but the more we learn, the less China’s official story sounds right. The World Health Organization’s year-long endorsement of Beijing means nothing. At this point, even the WHO is starting to say we need a more thorough inves…]]></summary>

Oil prices spiked today with WTI back above $70 for the first time since Oct 2018 as traders edged down their odds of a completed Iran nuclear deal (which would likely bring new supply).

Since it's been about three months since Gundlach's March 9 webcast when he laid out his outlook for the year, here is a recap of what he said then courtesy of Bloomberg:



Gundlach reiterated his bearish dollar call in the short-term, saying the greenback will be correlated to the budget. The Bloomberg Dollar Index has since declined 2.4% since he said that.

Just as Ontario finally lifted some of its COVID-19-inspired travel restrictions, the US Department of State announced plans to revise its travel advisory for dozens of countries, including its neighbors, Canada and Mexico. While the border between American and Canada may remain closed until September, the State Department's decision to lower its travel advisory to a Level 3 from a Level 4 could have major implications for tourism around the world.


Back in April, the US rated about 150 countries out of 209 as "Level 4: Do Not Travel." Today that number has fallen to about 125 at the highest advisory level.

Twitter handle "Insider Paper" reports a massive fire has erupted at a polysilicon plant in China. 







According to the report, "an explosion" occurred at a polysilicon plant in Shihezi City, Xinjiang, China. Polysilicon, or poly-Si, is used as a raw material by the solar photovoltaic and electronics industries.

This is after a briefing issued by the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) early this week which alleged Iran is failing to cooperate with the nuclear watchdog after it found nuclear particles at multiple undeclared sites, possibly suggesting a more expanded program than previously believed.

Damn near every economist and analyst seem oblivious to the point being made in this article. The Fed should be ecstatic so many people are willing to invest in intangible assets. By not buying  tangible and real items they help to minimize inflation. In our bullshit world where media outlets like Bloomberg tout the message if you are not in this rising market, you are missing out, it is understandable that people want in. With this in mind, it is no wonder the investment world has become a minefield that is often compared to a casino.

Authored by Matthew Vadum via The Epoch Times,


Alabama and Georgia real estate agents have asked the Supreme Court to block a federal moratorium on evictions that was imposed last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid the pandemic.







Congress enacted a nationwide moratorium on evictions and extended its life through Jan. 31, 2021. The Atlanta-based CDC, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, then imposed its own moratorium at the behest of then-President Donald Trump, the current iteration of which is set to run out on June 30. The theory was that uprooting tenants would spread the virus, which now appears to be in decline. Violators could face criminal p…]]></summary>

By Ye Xie, Bloomberg reporter and Markets Live commentator


A mysterious surge in dollar lending by Chinese banks in an arcane corner of the financial market is leading some investors to wonder whether it’s somehow related to the “stealth intervention” by the PBOC to slow yuan appreciation.


For years, Chinese banks had little use for foreign-currency reverse repo, which is effectively collateralized lending. That has dramatically changed since the pandemic. Banks’ FX reverse repos surged to a record $87 billion in April, from less than $2 billion a year earlier.


“Historically, Chinese banks FX assets and liabilities have consisted almost exclusively of loans and deposits,” Alex Etra, a senior strategist …]]></summary>

The short answer is: not much except for vague warnings and threats, it appears. Blinken said during the interview that the US president intends to warn Putin "directly and clearly what he can expect from the United States if aggressive, reckless actions toward us continue."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Currency Story Has Undergone A Silent, Subtle Curve Shift

            
By Ven Ram, Bloomberg reporter and macro commentator


Front-end yields held hostage by central banks around the world have engendered a silent shift in currency pricing: exchange movements are being increasingly influenced by changes in the intermediate and longer segments of the yield curve.


Currencies that were typically more responsive to relative changes in yields at, say, the two-year part of the curve are now responding more and more to shifts at the five- and 10-year segments, with the dollar being a case in point.







The chart above shows how closely the Dollar Index has tracked five-year real yield spreads between the U.S. and Germany (hat tip to J. Paul Knight, assistant portfolio manager of U.S. large-cap equity at the Employees Retirement System of Texas for his observation). Indeed, the correlation between the spreads and the dollar in the past year is running at 0.57, reflecting its influence on the currency. Taken together with 10-year differentials , the two points of the curve delineate the trajectory of the dollar by more than four-fifths.







To be sure, it wasn’t always like this. Take a look at this chart above that encompasses a longer time frame, which shows the Dollar Index ignoring the movement in spreads. That was a time clearly before the pandemic when the U.S. economy was still in the midst of its longest post-war expansion, with central banks not anywhere near controlling the yield curve, de facto or de jure.

It looks like much to the surprise of no one, there's considerable waste and malfeasance taking place at the perpetually-taxpayer-bailed-out MTA.


A new MTA inspector general's report has revealed that MTA track engineers - to quote Rep. Al Green talking about Citadel earlier this year - "have been naughty for some time".


The inspector general is reportedly "furious" after the findings of an 11 month investigation found that seven NYC Transit track inspectors were skipping inspections and falsifying inspection reports. The employees in question have been suspended, according to an RT&S report.

A New York parent brought the heat to members of the Carmel Central School District board for 'emotionally abusing' children by 'indoctrinating them with communist values.'







In comments at a school board business meeting in Putnam County, NY on Thursday, parent Tatiyana Ibrahim - whose child is a student, slammed the educators for promoting Critical Race Theory (CRT), Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ and anti-police ideologies both on and off campus.


"Stop indoctrinating our children. Stop teaching our children to hate the police. Stop teaching our children that if they don’t agree with the LGBT community that they’re homophobic. You have no idea each child’s life," she said, adding "You don’t know what their family lifestyle consists of, you don’t know the makeup of their life."


Watch:





Ibrahim shut down school board members' objections several times - in between calling out two teachers for posting their political beliefs online. When board members told her she wasn't allowed to reference people by name, Ibrahim claimed those teachers called "for the death of a former president," and that students who don't support Black Lives Matter should be "canceled out."


"Why are we not allowed to say names? Why am I not allowed when they purposefully expose themselves on social media, talking about calling for the death of a former president, or saying that any child who doesn’t believe in Black Lives Matter should be canceled out. Is this what my tax dollars are paying for?" she asked.


"You’re emotionally abusing our children and mentally abusing them," Ibrahim continued. "You’re demoralizing them by teaching them communist values, this is still America, ma’am."

Texas has joined a coalition of what is now 25 states urging the U.S. Supreme Court to repeal a New Jersey law banning the possession of firearms with magazines that hold more than 10 bullets, arguing the prohibition violates the Second Amendment and puts law-abiding citizens less able to defend themselves against dangerous criminals.


Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced in a statement that he had signed onto an amicus brief (pdf) which argues that allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms with 11-plus capacity magazines benefits public safety, counterbalances the threat of illegal gun violence, and helps “make our streets safer.”…]]></summary>

Since then, Rhoades has really made a go of it, pitching coins like "cumrocket" and "titcoin".

Below is my column in the Hill on the future of the filibuster and why this may be the most credible period for the use of such a compromise-forcing rule. There have always been good-faith arguments against the use of such a rule as inhibiting democratic voting. After all, the rule blocks bare majority voting. However, with a razor-thin margin in both houses, the use of such a rule can help force greater dialogue and compromise in Congress, which most voters indicate that they want in polls. It now appears that Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.V.) will block the federal voting rights legislation even without a filibuster. As a result he was attacked …]]></summary>

Amazon shares tumbled to their lowest levels of the session on Monday amid reports that Amazon would be included in a G-7 deal cemented over the weekend to retool the minimum corporate tax in some of the world's wealthiest nations (though a US-led movement to force the proposal down the throats of reluctant Ireland, Singapore and other low-tax nations remains very much in doubt).







As we learned over the weekend via a communique from G-7 ministers, a pillar of the deal envisaged that the tax would apply on "profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises." Thanks to Amazon's low-margin e-commerce business, the firm doesn't technically meet that cutoff, as t…]]></summary>

People caught on that the returns on the frenzied hamster wheel of "normal" have been diminishing for decades, but everyone was too busy to notice.


The superficial "return to normal" narrative focuses solely on first order effects: now that people can dispense with masks and social distancing, they are resuming their pre-pandemic spending orgy with a vengeance, which augurs great profits for Corporate America and higher tax revenues. Yea for "return to normal."


This superficial narrative ignores second-order effects of the pandemic. Recall that first order effects: every action has a consequence. Second order effects: every consequence has its own consequence. We ca…]]></summary>

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called for Dr. Anthony Fauci to resign from his position as head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) following the publication of a trove of hundreds of emails.







McCarthy, speaking to Breitbart News over the past weekend, said that the American public has lost trust in Fauci after emails released last week raised questions about how Fauci handled the COVID-19 pandemic and his messaging to media outlets. Fauci has defended his emails and said they are being taken out of context.

After several months of blowout consumer credit prints, including two consecutive months in which revolving (i.e., credit card) debt, rose after shrinking 10 of the previous 11 months, America's credit-funded spending spree abruptly slowed in April, when total consumer credit rose by $18.6BN, down from $25.8BN in March (since revised conveniently to $18.6BN), and missing expectations of $20.5BN. Overall, total consumer credit rose at a 5.3% annual rate in April to a new all time high of $4.238 trillion.


What was most notable about the April data, however, is that revolving credit actually declined by $1.96 billion to $964 billion, well below the record high of $1.094 trillion reached in Dece…]]></summary>

Trump's team, spearheaded by adviser Peter Navarro, had gone so far as to draft an executive order and compile a reparations bill, however the advanced plans were scrapped at the last minute after Trump's ever-helpful advisers (Larry Kudlow in particular) talked him out of it, according to an upcoming book on the origins of COVID-19, What Really Happened in Wuhan.

“This week, I’ve had five death threats just for being outspoken on it,” Paul said, adding “I don’t know what the world’s coming to, you can’t ask honest, difficult questions that in the end have proved out that Dr. Fauci was not being honest with us.”

Last week again we saw the tiniest dip in markets instantly reverted and markets again closed at the weekly highs on Friday, near all time highs as a matter of fact. Indeed, the historical backtest scenarios outlined in The Trap permit for marginal new highs. And in keeping with observing the set up develop we can note that during this renewed run higher last week we saw something we haven’t seen since the last major top.

Surging construction costs to build a new home is not sustainable and is becoming a pain in the arse for homebuilders and prospective homebuyers. From concrete to lumber to copper pipes to paint and even appliances, costs have surged over the past year.

The Georgia Republican Party on Saturday approved a resolution censuring Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, local media reported.


The Georgia GOP during a convention approved a resolution that says Raffensperger, a Republican, failed to perform his duties in “accordance with the laws of the Constitution of the State of Georgia,” WSB-TV reported.







The document says the failure stemmed from Raffensperger entering into a settlement agreement with the Democratic Party of Georgia, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Liftoff of NASA's Mars helicopter Ingenuity will occur no later than today if all goes to plan, according to a NASA press release. 


Ingenuity, a small robotic helicopter weighing no more than 4 pounds, is preparing for its seventh flight today. The mission is to fly Ingenuity 350 feet south from its current location on the floor of Jezero Crater. 



"This will mark the second time the helicopter will land at an airfield that it did not survey from the air during a previous flight," NASA wrote. "Instead, the Ingenuity team is relying on imagery collected by the HiRISE camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that suggests this new base of operations is relatively flat and has few surface obstructions."



On May 22, Ingenuity flew its sixth mission that did not go so well. The solar-powered helicopter experienced glitches that interrupted internal systems. There was no mention of what caused the glitches; the craft was able to land safely. 







Ingenuity has marvelously performed five flights and beamed incredible images from Mars back to Earth. 


NASA also has the Perseverance rover conducting land-based missions in the search for life. 


In the last couple of months, the Red Planet has become a hotspot for the US and China, with China landing a rover of its own on the planet.


Sudden interest in Mars between both countries is because the planet allegedly has an abundance of rare metals that will power tomorrow's economy.

By Variant Perception


We have seen much commentary that if US 10y yields go back to 2.5% or 3.0%, then equity markets suffer.  We prefer a different way to looking at the problem.  The key is what inflation is doing alongside any move in nominal yields. The below chart shows the % of the US yield curve trading below inflation. We highlight in green the periods when more than 50% of the yield curve is trading below inflation (as is the case today).


Source: Bloomberg, Macrobond and Variant Perception


Typically, negative real yields are very stimulative for equities.  It is only when most of the yield curve is trading above inflation (white bars in right chart above) that equity markets start to face persistent headwinds.


Equity investors do need to worry about rising yields in terms of sector rotation.  Duration is a basic concept for fixed income investors, but for equity investors, it is a less common method to look at portfolio exposures.


We have built a duration calculator for equities, using a combination of a 15-year DCF (consensus earnings forecasts, 2% terminal growth rate, individual cost of equity) and a terminal value duration component. This allows us to see which equities are most sensitive to a move in yields.


For the stocks in the Russell 1000, we calculate the duration of each name and aggregate to find the duration for different sectors. Financials, energy and consumer staples look like relative safe-havens. Info tech, healthcare and consumer discretionaries have the highest durations and are more vulnerable to yield moves.

California, with its relatively large tax burden compared to other states, has seen a taxpayer exodus in recent years and, along with it, billions in taxable gross income.


State-to-state migration data recently released by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shows that California lost an estimated net 70,534 households—or 165,355 taxpayers and their dependents—in the years 2017-2018, with those fleeing taking around $8.8 billion in net adjusted gross income with them.

By Michael Wilson, chief equity strategist of Morgan Stanley


Over the past few weeks, we’ve been spending a lot of time with investors discussing and debating our mid-year outlook. Here are the highlights:



First, investors are definitely more receptive to the mid-cycle transition narrative that we introduced a few months ago. There’s an acknowledgement that something has changed in the market, because more investors are struggling to make money consistently as leadership flip-flops day to day. This is consistent with the typical mid-cycle transition as the market struggles to find the next consensus trade.

For the second month in a row, the US payroll employment report has come in below expectations. The miss this month was not quite as bad as the miss last month, but was still notable. The market was expecting 675K new jobs, but only 559K were added.


Nearly all of the jobs added were in the leisure & hospitality and education categories. This is unsurprising given re-openings will affect those sectors particularly acutely. But, for the second month in a row we also saw fairly weak numbers out of both construction and manufacturing. Construction jobs fell by 20K while manufacturing jobs only rose by 23K after a 32K decline in April. F…]]></summary>

For the past several months, Morgan Stanley's fundamental analysts have been turning increasingly bearish on stocks, with the pessimistic sentiment plateauing earlier this week when chief equity strategist Michael Wilson said that there is far too much optimism in the market, and that while earnings are slowly rising, forward PE multiples are far too high and are set to slide, with "the de-rating about 75% to go or an approximate 15% decline in P/Es from here."

Thanks to some confusing verbal gymnastics by Dr. Anthony Fauci, some in the media are giving the impression that there’s no proof U.S. tax money funded “gain of function” research or that, perhaps, the research didn’t qualify as gain of function. However, the evidence on this point is clear cut.

Donald Trump will return to the political stage Saturday night with a speech at the North Carolina Republican Convention - his first major speech since CPAC in February, but more importantly - his first since he was vindicated over the possibility that COVID-19 escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.







It also comes after anti-Trump GOP Congresswoman Liz Cheney (WY) was outed from her leadership position due to her frequent criticism of Trump.


In a Friday statement, the former president said that it would be "a great honor to be speaking at the North Carolina GOP convention," adding "I understand the place will be packed, all records broken!"


Trump carried North Carolina during both of his presidential bids - visiting the state 14 times during the final year of his presidency. He's scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. to a sold out audience of 1,250 people.

Via WeMeantWell.com,


In the post-vaccination era, why don’t people remove their masks? Learned helplessness, employed as a control tool.







Learned helplessness is well-documented. It takes place when an individual believes he continuously faces a negative, uncontrollable situation and stops trying to improve his circumstances, even when he has the ability to do so. Discovering the loss of control elicits a passive reaction to a harmful situation. Psychologists call this a maladaptive response, characterized by avoidance of challenges and the collapse of problem-solving when obstacles arise. You give up trying to fight back.

Inflation is in the news, but there are a couple of things about inflation that don't get much coverage. Let's start with the trope that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. Actually, no.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong Parking Spot Sells For Record-Breaking $1.3 Million

            
Even as thousands of Hong Kongers flee to the UK or elsewhere to escape China's crackdown on political freedoms, the city-state's property market is breaking yet another record.


Citing a report in the Hong Kong Economic Times, Bloomberg reports that Wharf Holdings and Nan Fung Group sold a parking space for HK$10.2 million ($1.3 million) at the luxury Mount Nicholson residential project, according to a source. The price beat the previous record of HK$7.6 million for a spot in an office tower set back in 2019, before Hong Kong's protest movement triggered a crackdown by Beijing that has engulfed the territory's future in uncertainty, especially since China can simply snatch anyone - foreign nationals or otherwise - from Hong Kong's jurisdiction.







Mount Nicholson has a reputation for being one of the most iconic upscale projects in Hong Kong. At one point, an apartment in the project was the most expensive in Asia before the title was taken by CK Asset Holdings Ltd.’s 21 Borrett Road in February.


As that record-breaking sale might suggest, the parking spot record isn't a total surprise. HK has been seeing a comeback in the luxury home market in recent months, seeing record-breaking transactions as buyer's confidence returns. A house on Hong Kong's famous Peak (a luxury residential area overlooking the rest of the city) just rented for HK$1.6 a month in May.


Still, despite its recent sharp rebound, Hong Kong's economy "isn't out of the woods just yet," according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau. HK's economy grew 7.9% in the first quarter of 2021 vs. a year ago, marking the first economic expansion after six consecutive quarters of contraction. Yau appeared on CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" Thursday morning to discuss it.





While retail sales have seen a strong rebound, tourism remains weak, and the expansion is on uneven footing, Yau said.

A recent report documented up to 6,000 foreign fishing vessels that disabled their public tracking devices for more than 24 hours along the border of Argentina’s national waters, sounding the alarm that they could be illegally fishing in the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).


“The Chinese fleet was responsible for 66 percent of these incidents,” said the June report by Oceana, a Washington-based non-profit organization dedicated to protecting and restoring the global oceans. The report claims that hundreds of Chinese fishing vessels mainly target shortfin squid, which is vital to both Argentina’s economy and ecosystem.

Taiwan is about to be front and center again this coming week as Washington prepares for its next shot across China's bow - this time by another high level US delegation, something which China has long condemned as "signaling pro-democracy forces" on the island in contradiction to the official One China policy. 


Reuters has confirmed in a weekend report that "Three US senators will visit Taiwan on Sunday and will meet President Tsai Ing-wen to discuss security and other issues, Taiwan's government and the de facto U.S. embassy in Taipei said on Saturday, a trip that will likely irritate China." The meeting is expected to be held at a military wing of the island's main international airport.

Authored by Mark Jeftovic via BombThrower.com,


Earlier today the news started coming out that the US will start treating ransomware on par with terrorism. This is in the wake of a string of catastrophic attacks, not only ransomware but also several supply chain attacks.


There is some concern within crypto-currency circles that this may turn into a new FUD-cycle for Bitcoin. There is already no shortage of lo-res intellects calling for a ban on Bitcoin and crypto-currencies, thinking that even if cryptos could be banned (they can’t) that it would eliminate the problem of ransomware.


It wouldn’t.


Here’s why:


Ransomware attacks are neither enabled nor incentivized by the existence of Bitcoin. …]]></summary>

There's now officially a children's book based on the "Great GME Squeeze of 2021".


Amazon has started selling a book called "Stonks On The Moon!" which tells the story - in children's parlance - of the "mayhem being inflicted on Wall Street by a new wave of retail investors championing the cause of GameStop Corp," according to WeBull.


The story tells the tale of Stonks, a young ape, who is helped along by a character based on Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill in building a rocket to visit the moon. 


According to WeBull, the book's author, who goes by the name "Professor Clark" is actually Dillon Clark, who calls himself "an IT professional at a bank in the middle of Illinois in the middle of a cornfield." 







Clark said: “It's kind of a children's book for adults and children. A kid can read it and be like, ‘Hey, I understand it. I get a good message from it.' But then the adult can read it and be like, ‘Oh, I see what's going on there'.”


“It's been great,” he stated. “All the apes on Reddit have been super, super nice.”


Clark is also holding out hope that Elon Musk will read the audio version: “I think ‘Stonks on the Moon!’ would be awesome if Elon Musk narrated. I've been tweeting at him every day for the last 35 days, and I'm doing it for a year straight.”


The book is 25 pages and already has 35 reviews with an average of 5 stars on Amazon, where it started selling on May 27. 







Meanwhile, the Fed still sees no signs of market excess...

Users in the United States and other countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and Singapore, reported that Bing returned the message “There are no results for tank man” when they tried to search the term.


Meanwhile, rival search engine Google, on the other hand, returned many results for the image when the “tank man” query was entered on Friday.

“The good news is that we did indeed get the rally we were expecting. The not-so-good news is that the rally already consumed a majority of the ‘buy signal.’ Such does not mean the market is about to correct; it does suggest that upside remains limited near term.”

First, on Thursday evening, bitcoin tumbled after the Tesla billionaire issued a cryptic tweet that many interpreted as the billionaire’s breakup with bitcoin.

Instead, the vast majority of the “rulemaking” governing Americans’ day-to-day lives now takes place behind closed doors, deep in the bowels of the administrative state’s sprawling bureaucracy.

Closures due to the Covid pandemic resulted in $9.8 billion in lost construction activity and 74,000 direct and indirect lost jobs in New York City, according to a report by the Building Trades Employers’ Association. The decline in jobs contributed to a $5.5 billion loss in total wages, the report said.

Authored by Ryan McMaken via The Mises Institute,


In twenty-first century America, millions of Americans—Christians and social conservatives especially—are finding that the nation’s most influential institutions appear to be implacably hostile toward them.


These institutions include universities, public schools, the news media, and government bureaucracies. Moreover, corporate America has increasingly embraced a posture of hostility toward groups considered to be “right wing” or conservative.







Recent examples are numerous, to say the least. Major League Baseball, for instance, recently moved its all-star game out of the state of Georgia with the explicit purpose of punishing voters and po…]]></summary>

More than a year since the virus pandemic began, New York City's economy is roaring back open. But at least one segment of the metro area's economy remains in dire straits: the office space market. 


According to Bloomberg, citing a commercial real estate brokerage report by Colliers, Manhattan's supply of office space continues to hit new records even as leasing increases. 


The availability rate rose for a 12th straight month in May to 17%; inventory since the pandemic began jumped 70% to a whopping 92 million square feet. 


Colliers had some good news. It said demand is coming back with leases increasing 8% versus last May, while the average asking rents rose 0.4% to $73.26 a square foot.

After more than two years of UFO 'evidence' via the New York Times detailing dozens of encounters between Navy pilots and unidentified aerial phenomena, the punchline - according to an upcoming government report, is: 'we don't think it's aliens, but it's not Americans' - and therefore America should probably spend untold billions on figuring out how to make 90-degree turns at mach 5 and disappear into the ocean, after disabling a nuclear installation.


Or, as journalist Caitlin Johnstone puts it: The MSM is wasting no time using the UFO report to promote an arms race.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Most Americans believe that the coronavirus pandemic originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, with almost a quarter saying they believe it was released on purpose, according to a YouGov poll.







A total of 58% of Americans agree that its is ‘definitely or probably true’ that the virus came out of the Wuhan lab.

Only 13% are still buying the ‘it mutated naturally from bats’ claim.


Indeed, YouGov notes “When it comes to the more specific circumstances of the virus’ emergence, 24% think it was created in a laboratory and was released on purpose, 18% think it was lab-created and escaped by accident, while a further 12% think it was a naturally occurring disease that was being examined in a laboratory but was released by accident.”


This is despite a massive co-ordinated attempt by the establishment media and big-tech to censor and dismiss the lab leak idea as a crazy ‘conspiracy theory’.

Authored by Charles Kennedy via OilPrice.com,


Commodity traders are in a rush to ship as much Venezuelan heavy crude to China as possible before a new fuel tax kicks in, causing a 40-50-percent rise in prices, Reuters reports, citing industry insiders and shipping data.







Over the last 12 months, China has seen a 13-fold increase in imports of bitumen blends, some 90 percent of which was actually heavy crude from Venezuela, according to data from cargo tracker Vortexa Analytics. The crude was labeled as Malaysian bitumen blend to avoid sanction action from the United States.


According to Vortexa, the average daily rate of Venezuelan oil imports into China over the past year was some 324,000 barrels, which represented about two-thirds of Venezuela's total exports of crude during the period.


However, things are about to change as China plans to introduce a tax on bitumen blend imports later this month. This will increase prices by 40 to 50 percent, and the flow of Venezuelan oil may well thin considerably.



"While not all of the 350,000 to 400,000 bpd of the additional bitumen flowing into China will disappear overnight, a large proportion of it will be at risk," an Energy Aspects analyst told Reuters.



U.S. sanctions have reduced Venezuelan oil output to some half a million barrels daily over the two years since they were introduced.







Even though the Biden administration has extended a sanction waiver for several U.S. oil companies, including Chevron and Halliburton, PDVSA is struggling to maintain production.


Earlier this year, the state-owned oil major calculated it would need investments of $58 billion to boost production to where it was before Hugo Chavez rose to power in the late 90s. In 1998, Venezuela was pumping 2.3 million barrels of crude daily. The company said it planned to seek investments from both local and foreign companies to that end.

Ahead of the G-20 summit in the UK later this month, finance ministers from the G-7 are reportedly on the cusp of a deal for a minimum corporate tax rate of "at least 15%", while differences remain about how megacap tech firms should be taxed. The group will hold a series of virtual and in-person meetings over the weekend where talks will continue.


According to Bloomberg, the ministers are meeting on Friday and Saturday in London, and will likely release a statement over the weekend once they have settled on a mutually-agreeable framework. However, a deal involving just the members of the G-7 won't amount to much, since developed economies with competitive corporate tax rates (li…]]></summary>

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Senator Rand Paul, who has constantly challenged the contradictory and unscientific statements of Dr Fauci, as well as pointing out Fauci’s involvement in funding gain of function research with coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, appeared vindicated in an interview Thursday following disturbing revelations from released emails, which Paul urged should be the final nail in Fauci’s coffin.







Speaking to Laura Ingraham, Paul asserted that “The emails paint a disturbing picture, a disturbing picture of Dr. Fauci, from the very beginning, worrying that he had been funding gain-of-function research. He knows it to this day, but hasn’t admitted it.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[22.4 Down, 14.7 Up, 7.6 To Go: "The Fed Faces A Difficult Decision"

            
After today’s mixed US payrolls report, today’s Chart of the Day from DB's Jim Reid shows we are still 7.6 million jobs away from where we were when the pandemic hit. 


We lost 22.4 million in the first 2 months and have gained 14.7 million over the last 13 months. 2021 has "only" seen an average monthly payrolls increase of 478k though May.







And while some saw only disappointment in the May jobs data, it was a truly Goldilocks report: as Reid says, "there was clearly something for everyone in the report. The Fed will continue to suggest they are a long way from their employment goals and the inflationists will cite the higher earnings in the release as evidence that it's hard to find employees at the right price."


Meanwhile, according to BofA, the report leaves the Fed "to remain patient, slowly and carefully taking baby steps to set the stage for tapering but unlikely to send an explicit signal until the September FOMC meeting."


Maybe, Reid asks, you can have a relatively slow jobs recovery and inflation.



"If that does happen then the Fed will have difficult decisions to make at some point." 



On that, the DB strategist concludes that "next week's US CPI will be the most watched economic report of the year so far."

Real Vision editors Max Wiethe and Jack Farley make sense of a truly odd week, one that began with the reappearance of memestock mania and ended with the S&P 500 flirting with all-time highs (and with the VIX very close to a pre-pandemic low). Farley and Wiethe cover today’s strong rally in stocks as well as bonds, on the release of the U.S. non-farm payrolls data which missed economist expectations. Farley inspects Bill Ackman’s latest plans to acquire a slice of Universal Music Group via his SPAC, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings ($PSTH), and Wiethe looks forward to next week’s Fed meeting and release of the latest inflation data.

Jerome Powell might be done as a useful Federal Reserve Chairman.  Not that Fed Chairs provide a use that’s of any real value.  They mainly excel at destroying the wealth of wage earners and savers for the benefit of member banks.


But as Powell loses a grip on price inflation the business of supplying credit at a fixed rate of return becomes less fruitful.  Consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), is rising at an annual rate of 4.2 percent.  That’s well above interest rate of a 30 year fixed mortgage, which is currently 3.1 percent.


It doesn’t take much imagination to foresee a CPI over 6 percent.  At that rate of price inflation, what good t…]]></summary>

One of the most significant events of the last two decades has been largely memory-holed: the October, 2001 anthrax attacks in the U.S. Beginning just one week after 9/11 and extending for another three weeks, a highly weaponized and sophisticated strain of anthrax had been sent around the country through the U.S. Postal Service addressed to some of the country's most prominent political and media figures.

They picked and chose which businesses could stay open without much rationale. They sent the infected into nursing homes occupied by the weak and vulnerable.


Their rules for prosecuting those who violated social distancing, sheltering in place, mask wearing or violent protesting often hinged on political grounds. Their spending measures on “infrastructure” and “health care” were excuses to lard up redistributive entitlements.

Update (1800ET): Just when you thought it was safe to turn off your AMC-focused mind, after an extremely volatile trading day, AMC filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC in connection with the Company’s 2021 Annual Meeting scheduled for July 29, 2021.


The preliminary proxy statement, which is subject to SEC review, includes the following important proposals:




	
Increase authorized share capital by 25 million shares (effective in 2022)

This will hardly come as a surprise to anyone who followed the manic reddit-driven action over the past 48 hours: according to Goldman's Prime Brokerage, we just witnessed the "largest US single stock short covering since mid-March amid a sharp rally in High Retail Sentiment stocks" and while US stocks saw modest net buying yesterday, it was driven by risk-off flows "with short covers outpacing long sales 3 to 1."


The catalyst is well known: a furious, face-ripper of a rally in the heavily-shorted meme stocks, which pushed the Goldman Retail Sentiment Basket, (GSCBHTBR) i.e., the retail favorite stocks up +25% yesterday and up +61% over the last 7 sessions!

Isn’t is amazing how quickly things seem to change when it’s in the interest of those that think they run the world? For years we’ve been trying to get access to Hillary Clinton’s missing e-mails as Secretary of State but to no avail. However, at the most opportune time in the collapsing COVID story, Dr. Anthony Fauci’s emails are uncovered and broadcast to the world.


The same mechanism, FOIA, that Hillary has stonewalled us on for six years uncovers Fauci’s emails in six weeks?







Doesn’t that strike you as just the slightest bit odd?

Someone should put Elon Musk on notice: the legacy automakers have officially entered the EV sales fray.


And domestic U.S. automakers have officially hit the ground running.


Ford announced on Thursday that U.S. sales were up 4.1% to 161,725 units in May, while YTD sales were up 11.3%. The "everything bubble" created by Central Banks helped truck sales rise 11.6% over the same period and SUV sales to rise 48.6%. These numbers were despite the auto industry continuing to grapple with a semiconductor shortage - one that had even left Ford trucks stranded on the side of the road, waiting for parts, earlier this year. 


But the standout in Ford's report? EV sales were up 184% to 10,364 units. The company al…]]></summary>

It appears the Biden administration has realized their ambitious tax hikes have a snowball's chance in hell of passing, given the slim majority Democrats hold in both chambers of Congress - which include two serious moderates (Manchin and Sinema) and a parliamentarian who won't let them get away with forcing legislation through via reconciliation (a simple majority).


Now, according to the Washington Post, Biden has outlined a plan for $1 trillion in new spending financed through tax changes which would not focus on raising the top corporate rate - a major concession to Republicans who opposed an earlier proposal to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.

For about 1 in 4, Social Security provides at least 90 percent of their income.


How many retired workers are getting less than $1,000 per month in Social Security benefits? The question came up and I was curious enough to find the answer, and download the data into an Excel spreadsheet which I saved as a PDF that you can review here. Note that this data is for the 46.5 million retired workers only, and does not include benefits paid to survivors, spouses, disabled, etc.


This led to a deep dive into the basic numbers of Social Security beneficiaries and expenses, which are summarized in the chart below. Here are the basics:

President Biden repeatedly insists that his infrastructure plan will create millions of jobs and labor unions will be the big winners. But interviews with economists, union leaders, government officials and trade groups as well as basic math suggest otherwise.


The once dominant trade and construction unions no longer have enough members outside of their strongholds on both coasts and in the Midwest to claim most of the projected infrastructure jobs. By some estimates, two-thirds of these jobs will go to nonunion workers who dominate the construction markets in most states.

Pouring more fuel on what was already today's dumpster fire of a market, Bloomberg reported that according to a memo it had seen, Jefferies told clients its prime brokerage arm will no longer allow the execution of short sells in meme stocks such as AMC, GameStop and MicroVision.


“Until further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options in GME, AMC and MVIS,” the memo noted. The firm will no longer allow the execution of short sells of those securities, the memo continued, noting that other stocks may be added to that list.


The news comes in a rollercoaster session for AMC which after plunging as much as 30% on news it was selling 11.55MM shares in an At The Market offering, reversed all losses after announcing it had completed the offering, gaining as much as 10% before again reversing the move and last seen down about 9% at $57. Expect much more drama here.

“Charter rates for short employment … have gone out of control,” said Alphaliner in its new weekly report.



“Depending on the sources, the ship would have obtained anything between $100,000 and $145,000 per day, an absolute historic high. The name of the charterer has not been fully confirmed, although it is believed to be a forwarder.”

Fox News' Tucker Carlson ripped "the utter fraudulence of Tony Fauci" Wednesday night, after BuzzFeed and the Washington Post obtained thousands of pages of emails through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, revealing that the nation's top virologist was telling the public one thing, while furiously working on damage control and narrative-shaping as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded.







According to Carlson, Americans assumed "that the man in charge of protecting the US from COVID must be rational and impressive," adding "We also assumed he must be honest. But we were wrong.

Authored by Adam Andrzejewski via RealClear Policy (emphasis ours),


New York City had more than 114,000 municipal workers earning $100,000 or more in 2019. That is up sharply from 76,166 employees with pay exceeding $100,000 in 2016.







Data comes a year before the pandemic hit and is the latest year available.


These were not just high-level employees like agency commissioners or deputy mayors. NYC employees included thermostat repairmen making up to $198,630; regular laborers hauling away $213,169; electricians taking home $253,132; and plumbers pocketing up to $286,245.


The cost of benefits would be additional and is not included in these figures.


These large paychecks are only sustainable because Congress bailed out New York City for $4.3 billion in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The federal bailout more than covered the overstated deficits of the city.


City officials estimated a $5.5 billion gap, but actual revenues came in $2.7 billion higher. Using $1.2 billion from reserves, and finding $1 billion in unspecified labor savings, among other things closed the budget gap.


Therefore, the federal money now exists for extra spending.


In December, Fitch Ratings downgraded New York City’s bond rating and issued a negative outlook. That was after Moody’s Investors Service lowered the credit ratings of both the state and city in October.

I’ve been learning as much as I can about the new UFO narrative the political/media class have been pushing in conjunction with the US military to prepare for the Senate report that’s due to be released this month.


One of the disconcerting things I’ve been seeing again and again from all the major players in this new narrative like Lue Elizondo and Christopher Mellon is the absurd assertion that not only is it entirely possible that the unknown phenomena allegedly being regularly witnessed by military personnel are extraterrestrial in origin, but that if they are extraterrestrial they may want to hurt us.

Landlords across the country, the least-pitied group of Americans, were handed a loss on Wednesday after  a federal appeals court in Washington DC denied a request to resume evictions amid a contentious dispute over a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) moratorium during the pandemic.







To recap, last month US District Judge Dabney Friedrich struck down the CDC moratorium on evictions, finding that the agency had overstepped its authority - yet agreeing to block her own ruling from taking immediate affect in order for the Biden administration to launch an appeal, according to The Hill.

Authored by Andy Puzder via RealClearPolitics.com, 


In a speech last week introducing his proposed $6 trillion 2022 budget, President Biden claimed that the benefits of the Republican Party’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act “went to the wealthiest 1% of America.”


It’s not the first time he’s made this claim.


In his first speech to a joint session of Congress, Biden described the TCJA as a “huge windfall” for “those at the very top.” 


To right that wrong, he proposes getting rid of loopholes and raising the top tax rate from its current 37% to 39.6%.


Why? So that “the wealthiest 1% of Americans” will “pay their fair share,” a phrase that the president and his fellow Democrats repeat with abandon.

Oh how the mighty continue to fall.


Katerra, the construction giant that was backed by SoftBank, has officially told its employees that it is shutting down its operations. Katerra “had promised to shake up the construction industry with its efficient factories, prefab parts and modular construction units,” Bloomberg had reported on the company in the past.


But now the only thing it's shaking up are the lives of the 8,000 employees it had globally, as of last year, according to TechCrunch, who pointed out that the company had already struggled "to find a viable business in cheaply building properties for real estate developers".


The company was then beset by climbing labor and material costs associated with the pandemic (and perhaps now, the hyperinflation that's succeeding the pandemic). 


"So, you guys use a lot of lumber, or no?"


SoftBank tried to bail out the struggling company, offering $200 million on top of the billions it had already invested in the company, to buy a majority stake. But, not unlike the WeWork IPO, Katerra couldn't be saved. 


Bloomberg reports that the company is now likely going to walk away from "dozens" of projects it has already committed to. 


Among those being laid off are 117 workers in Seattle, according to The Seattle Times. The losses are expected to take effect on June 4. 


CEO Masayoshi Son had called Katerra one of his "regrets" in an interview with Barron's last month. The company had raised more than $2 billion since its founding in 2015.

The Chamber’s report released Tuesday found that the United States had a record 8.1 million vacant job openings in March—the last month where data was available—noting it was an increase of 600,000 from February.


But, the Chamber stressed that there “are approximately half as many available workers for every open job,” or 1.4 available workers per job opening, across the country “and the ratio continues to fall.” Compared with the previous 20 years, the…]]></summary>

Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


On Tuesday, the new head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency suggested more Israeli covert attacks and assassinations inside Iran should be expected even as the US and other world powers are negotiating a revival of the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA.


"The Iranian program will continue feeling Mossad’s might. We are well acquainted with the nuclear program and its various components, we know personally the factors that operate in it and also the forces that drive them," David Barnea said at his swearing-in ceremony, as quoted by Israel’s Ynet.







Barnea said the JCPOA negotiations show that Israel might have to act alone against Iran. "The agree…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Step Aside AMC: Here Are The Most Shorted Stocks Right Now

            
Four months after the Reddit crew sparked a historic market-wide short squeeze across a handful of small and mid-cap companies, which knocked out some of the most respected hedge funds in the world with Melvin Capital requiring a multi-billion bailout from Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen, the squeeze is back sending heavily shorted names like AMC, whose short interest we pointed out last week was off the charts...

... and which has exploded higher, a squeeze which has now shifted over to names such as Bed Bath and Beyond and various other small and mid-cap names.







Of course, there is no mystery what's behind this: just like in late January when the meme squeeze phenomenon first emerged, the common theme here is that all these stocks are extremely heavily shorted, and retail investors are seeking to squeeze the shorts once again and thus time with even more stimmy power.


To be sure, one look at the chart of the most heavily shorted names shows what's going on.







So, just like in late January, we have compiled a list of the most heavily shorted names. It may come as a surprise to some that the former leaders here, GME and AMC are not even in the top 30.


So which companies are? Below we have screened for the most shorted Russell 2000 names (based on SI as a % of float), and which we will use to constitute our latest and greatest short basket.







If the performance of our previous most shorted index is any indication, going long a market cap-weighted basket of these names - and especially the smaller, less liquid ones - could turn out to be the trade of the year, if not a lifetime.

We have a pretty good idea of what's behind the latest reddit meltup.


Unlike the March and April, when hedge funds remained largely inert on a net basis, still smarting from the bruising their short books suffered during the January and February meme stock meltups, May saw a renewed push to short beaten down names, with Goldman's Prime Brokerage reporting that its book was net sold for a second straight month, driven by short sales outpacing long buys 1.3 to 1.


According to GS Prime, trading flows in Single Names remained especially active both long and short, and made up approx. 85% of the global gross activity, the balance going to ETFs. That said, while macro products (Index and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oil Algos Confused After Big Crude Draw, Product Build

            
Oil prices rallied on the day as signs of a demand recovery from the US to Europe stoke optimism among producers and analysts in the crude market, combined with waning hopes for an Iran nuke deal.


Oil is in “strong demand right now,” with economies around the world opening up, Daniel Yergin, the oil historian and vice chairman at consultant IHS Markit Ltd., said in a Bloomberg Television interview.



"Oil is bid on the Iran timeline to adding barrels getting kicked further into the future--sometime between August and the fall," says Bob Yawger at Mizuho.



After last week's across-the-board draws, analysts expected another week of demand dominance.

Gasoline +2.51mm (-1.1mm exp)

	

	

	
Distillates +1.585mm (-1.6mm exp)

	


While crude stocks tumbled more than expected, gasoline and distillate stocks unexpectedly rose last week...

WTI hovered just below $68.80 ahead of the API print and barely budged on the mixed data...







“There’s plenty of room for upside here,” said Bob Yawger, head of the futures division at Mizuho Securities.


“Summer and the reopening of the economy is bullish for demand,” while “it looks much less likely we’ll have Iranian barrels any time soon than it did last week.”


But, the question now is whether oil prices can hold their gains "amid strong demand, despite plenty of downside risk on the supply side," said Robbie Fraser, global research & analytics manager at Schneider Electric, in a daily report.

The Department of Homeland Security on Friday issued a new warning bulletin, alerting Americans that domestic extremists may well use violence on the 100th Anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre. This was at least the fourth such bulletin issued this year by Homeland Security (DHS) warning of the same danger and, thus far, none of the fears it is trying to instill into the American population has materialized.

"Most people haven’t had a forty-plus year career, and they’ve only seen declining inflation over the last 30-plus years. So this is going to be a pretty big shock", Fink said, his warning falling on deaf ears.

The first thing any economist should do wen reading a budget proposal is to analyse the basic macro assumptions and the results presented by the administration. When both are poor, the budget should be criticised. This is the case of the Biden Budget Plan.







Same growth, a lot more debt and less employment.

Authored by Jamie Joseph via The Epoch Times,


Los Angeles is set ablaze up to 24 times a day. The cause? Thousands of homeless encampments...







This year, fires started in homeless encampments have accounted for 54 percent of the blazes battled by the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), according to officials—a sharp uptick compared to 2020.


As the county grapples with more than 66,000 people living on its streets, critics are pointing to the growing number of fires caused by the homeless as another indication that officials are mishandling the crisis. And in parts of the city where the homeless are concentrated, residents and business owners say their concerns are not being heard.

U.S. troops tasked with guarding nuclear bombs in Europe accidentally leaked highly sensitive information about these weapons on popular educational websites, according to Bellingcat.


Military personnel used popular learning websites such as Quizlet, Chegg Prep, and Cram to remember complex security protocols, exact locations, and other top-secret information. 


So how did Bellingcat's Foeke Postma uncover the leaked documents? Well, a simple search on the study websites revealed various sets of flashcards.

One suspects that historians and economists will consistently agree on one irrefutable fact: nations that allow their economies to bathe in red ink are destined to fail. This failure takes many roads and differs in timing, but massive, uncontrolled national deficits eventually reduce a nation state to being a pauper, a pariah -- and pathetic.


Enter Joe Biden's "American Jobs Plan," a $2.3 trillion spending scheme that takes some Americans' most fevered fantasies and wraps them inside an "infrastructure" label in an effort to convince Capitol Hill that the spending is all about roads and bridges.

A man in eastern China contracted what appears to be the first human case of H10N3, a type of avian influenza, according to Chinese regime officials.







The 41-year-old man, who was not named, was hospitalized in late April with H10N3 in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, located near Shanghai, according to China’s National Health Commission in a statement on its website.


The commission said that no other cases have been reported.



“This infection is an accidental cross-species transmission,” its statement said, while also claiming that “the risk of large-scale transmission is low,” according to a Chinese-to-English translation.

The Biden administration has scrapped FBI background checks for caregivers at its overpacked child migrant shelters (or as AOC no longer calls them, 'concentration camps'), alarming child welfare experts who say this compromises safety, according to the Chicago Tribune.







The move comes as Biden turns to "tent camps, convention centers and other huge facilities" which are operated by private contractors paid by the Department of Health and Human Services. In March, the administration announced that it would open eight new emergency sites across the Southwest, which will add 15,000 new beds - doubling capacity.

In January, 2020, when the World Health Organization insisted that COVID-19 wasn't transmissible between humans, and Dr. Anthony Fauci said that the risk to the American public from the virus was "low," officials at the National Institutes of Health were scrambling to perform damage control after a controversial - and now withdrawn - study suggested that there were HIV-like 'insertions' included in SARS-CoV-2.







The study, "Uncanny similarity of unique inserts on the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag," posited that segments of the virus's RNA had no relation to other coronaviruses such as SARS, and instead appeared to be closer to HIV.

A state bullion depository would not only create a safe place to store precious metals; it would increase the state’s financial independence. It could also facilitate the everyday use of gold and silver in financial transactions in Tennessee and set the stage to undermine the Federal Reserve’s monopoly on money.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEC Blasted Tesla In May 2020 For Failing To Oversee Musk's Tweets

            
In previously undisclosed documents, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, securities regulators told Tesla last year that CEO Elon Musk's use of Twitter had twice violated a court-ordered policy requiring his tweets to be preapproved by company lawyers.







In letters sent to Tesla in 2019 and 2020, the SEC reportedly said tweets that Musk wrote about Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price hadn't undergone the required preapproval by Tesla's lawyers.


As a reminder, Musk had publicly mocked the SEC even after settling the previous fraud claims with the agency.







Specifically, The Wall Street Journal reports that the SEC told Tesla in May 2020 that:



the company had failed “to enforce these procedures and controls despite repeated violations by Mr. Musk.”



The letter, signed by a senior SEC official in its San Francisco office, added:



“Tesla has abdicated the duties required of it by the court’s order.”



This perhaps explains why Musk himself was quick to admit in May 2020 that "no", his twitter remarks were not vetted.


Given the fact that we are just discovering these details now - at least 13 months after they occurred - as far as we can see, nothing at all has been done to either re-enforce the SEC-ordered oversight by Tesla lawyers, or to slow Musk's roll in tweeting frequency and absurdity (cough Dogecoin cough)...



Is the SEC going to - wait for it - tell Tesla to preclear Musk's tweets (again)?

— zerohedge (@zerohedge) February 25, 2021


...we can only imagine how long it will be before some actual actions are taken... or enforcements hardened over the carmaker's incessant need to 'share'.

By now, even the shoeshine boy knows that central banks are one-print trick pony farcical joke, one which is exposed not just by cryptos which have emerged as a clear alternative to fiat currencies, but by central banks themselves who are adopting their own digital currencies knowing well that the days of traditional paper money are numbered.


And yet within the giant Venn Diagram of the "big farce", there is a smaller Venn Diagram, which is basically everything and anything Turkey-related, and whose farcical content is exponentially more concentrated because while central banks have become the laughing stock of the financial world in its twilight days before the upcoming grea…]]></summary>

Amazon Sidewalk, the company's new shared mesh network that helps devices like Amazon Echo devices, Ring Security Cams, outdoor lights, motion sensors, and Tile trackers work better around the house and beyond, will be switched on next week. Tens of millions of Americans own Amazon devices, and the experimental network will turn users into guinea pigs next week, according to ArsTechnica.


On June 8, users who don't opt-out will be automatically enrolled in "Sidewalk." The mesh network, created by Echoes, cameras, and other smart devices under the Amazon brand, will use a small amount of bandwidth and broadcast to nearby neighbors and or city streets.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


More than 100 employees at Houston Methodist Hospital filed a lawsuit against their employer for requiring all staff members to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in order to keep their jobs.







Saying the COVID-19 vaccines are experimental and they don’t want to be “guinea pigs,” the 117 employees argued in court that it’s unlawful for their employers to require them to take the shots.



“Methodist Hospital is forcing its employees to be human ‘guinea pigs’ as a condition for continued employment,” their lawsuit (pdf) states. They wrote that the hospital’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate “requires the employee to subject themselves to medical…]]></summary>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who increasingly looks to be on his way out of power, said on Tuesday that's he's willing to worsen relations with the US under the Biden administration if it means preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.


"An Iranian nuclear bomb is a threat for the continuation of the Zionist project and we must fight it relentlessly," he said at a ceremony on the occasion of Israel's new Mossad chief David Barnea taking the helm. "If we have to choose between friction with our great friend the U.S. and the elimination of this existential threat, the elimination of the threat will come first," Netanyahu asserted.

In a decision that echos the WHO's decision back in early 2020 to rename the novel coronavirus to "COVID-19", the agency has decided to change the names of the most prominent mutant strains of the coronavirus to letters from the Greek alphabet.







Using letters like Alpha, Beta and Gamma (instead of B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) to refer to the variants will make it "easier and more practical" to discuss them with non-scientific audiences, the WHO said in a statement. COVID strains believed to be more infectious are deemed "of interest" and "of concern" by the WHO.

By Joe Carson, former chief economist at Alliance Bernstein


In Q1 2021, the US economy registered double-digit annualized growth in nominal GDP, a rare occurrence. Yet, an even more rare event is that corporate operating profits did not increase in the quarter when GDP growth increased double-digits.


How can companies' operating earnings be flat when nominal growth is booming? How does the GDP measure of operating square with S&P 500 firms reporting substantial gains in Q1, far exceeding analysts' estimates?

In a seeming repeat of the Trump admin attempt to impose a full naval blockade on Venezuela to prevent fuel and oil imports and exports, especially involving Iranian tankers, the US military is said to be actively monitoring two Iranian naval vessels which are believed headed toward Venezuela.


Washington has reportedly warned the Maduro government against receiving the warships, which likely have elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force members aboard. The two "rogue states" (as the US sees them) have become increasingly close especially under the prior four Trump years as they cooperated in circumventing US sanctions, and have grown militarily more cooperative.

Australia and New Zealand have managed to keep COVID cases and deaths at a minimum thanks largely to their isolated status, which has enabled both countries to "raise the drawbridge", so to speak, keeping out most foreigners since the start of the crisis.







But even with Australia's notoriously stringent COVID-19 restrictions, a few cases have managed to slip by. In the face of the biggest cluster uncovered in months, Melbourne and the surrounding Victoria State entered their 4th lockdown last week. Though it was only supposed to last a week, that could soon change as more cases are confirmed.

Three weeks before China admitted that a mysterious virus was circulating in the city of Wuhan, a 61-year-old woman who lived about a mile from several bat research facility was known as "Patient Su" at a local hospital, according to the Daily Mail.


Her identity was accidentally revealed after a leading Chinese official sent a screen-grab to a medical journal which partially revealed personal information, including the fact that she was admitted to the Rongjun Hospital in Wuhan, and "almost certainly lived in the Kaile Guiyan community on Zhuodaoquan Street, about 600 metres from the medical centre."

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is tasked with assessing all commercial or pedestrian traffic entering the United States by airplane, overland vehicle, ship or on foot. However, in Mexico, about 10 different organizations are tasked with implementing customs clearance, issuing permits and certificates of imports/exports and protecting the border, including the Mexican army, the Guardia Nacional and the federal Tax Administration Service (SAT).

Brace for more pessimistic news about the global semiconductor shortage...


Intel is now going on the record and doubling down on statements that its CEO made on 60 Minutes earlier this year, stating that it could take "several years" for the current supply shortage of semiconductors to be resolved. 


CEO Pat Gelsinger said that the pandemic-inspired "work from home" trend caused a "cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors", according to Reuters. 


"But while the industry has taken steps to address near term constraints it could still take a couple of years for the ecosystem to address shortages of foundry capacity, substrates and components," Gelsinger commented.

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the lead Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Sunday said it was “more likely than not” that COVID-19 originated from a lab accident, calling it the “worst cover-up in human history.”



“I do think it’s more likely than not it emerged out of the lab, most likely accidentally,” McCaul said during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.”


“Let me say, this is the worst cover-up in human history that we’ve seen resulting in 3.5 million deaths, creating economic devastation around the globe.”

On Memorial Day, the media do their usual sacralizing of war. Instead, it should be a day for the ritualized scourging of politicians.


During the last 70 years, their lies have resulted in the unnecessary deaths of almost 100,000 American soldiers and millions of foreigners. And yet, people still get teary-eyed when politicians take the stage to talk about their devotion to the troops.







On Memorial Day 2011, for instance, the Washington Post included numerous touching photographs of graves, recent widows or fatherless kids by the headstones, and stories of the troops’ sacrifices. The Post buried a short article in the middle of the A-Section (squee…]]></summary>

Former Trump National Security Adviser Micheal Flynn made an off-the-cuff statement over the weekend that a Myanmar-like military coup not only could happen, but "should happen" in the US.







Speaking at the Dallas "For God & Country Patriot Roundup," branded by Business Insider and MarketWatch as a "QAnon conference" (because a quilt with a "Q" on it was auctioned off at the event), Flynn was asked during a Q&A session "I want to know why what happened in Myanmar can’t happen here?"


To which Flynn - who spent 33 years as an Army intelligence officer - replied: "No reason. I mean, it should happen."

After it was revealed that the FBI pressured Flynn into pleading guilty amid threat of going after his son, leading the DOJ to drop its case against him (which a judge finally closed eight months later), Flynn has become an icon among former President Trump's most ardent supporters.


According to the New York Times, "He was one of the most extreme voices in Mr. Trump’s 77-day push to overturn the election," and suggested using the military to rerun the vote in key battleground states - which then-President Trump could have imposed martial law to enact.


"People out there talk about martial law like it’s something that we’ve never done," Flynn told Newsmax several months ago, noting that the military had taken over for civilian authorities dozens of times in US history.

North Korea has blasted what it's calling a "hostile policy" in the wake of the Biden White House lifting restrictions on South Korea's ballistic missile program, which is now authorized to develop missiles capable of traveling beyond prior limitations. 


During a May 21 US-South Korea summit the US side announced Seoul is now free to pursue missiles with unlimited ranges, but the statement out of a Pyongyang official said this will inevitably lead to an "acute and instable situation", according to the Associated Press. Previously the US imposed a limit of a 500 mile range (800km) on the south's missiles on concerns of a regional arms race.

On this solemn day there will be cemeteries all across the nation where loved ones will pay their humble respects and quiet tribute to a father, mother, sister, or brother. The loss may be fresh, or it may only be a distant but still painful memory. When I visit Arlington National Cemetery, I often see the tokens (flowers, stones, and photos) of remembrance left beh…]]></summary>

With at least 24 GOP-led states set to end federal unemployment assistance before they're set to expire on Sept. 6, million of Americans are going to need to dust off those resumes and start helping reduce the massive job shortage after being paid to stay home for over a year.







The benefits set to lapse include not only the additional $300 weekly federal supplement, but programs for gig workers and others who typically don't qualify for aid "(Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, or PUA) and for the long-term unemployed (Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, or PEUC) in most cases," according to CNBC, which has provided this handy guide to states set to end benefits, and when:

Authored by Mark Hendrickson via The Mises Institute,


To most people, “inflation” signifies widespread rising prices. Economists have long argued, as a matter of technical accuracy, that “inflation” denotes an increasing money supply. Frankly, though, most people don’t care what happens to the supply of money, but they care a lot about the prices they pay, so I’ll focus primarily on the numerous rapidly rising prices Americans are paying today.







Following are several examples of the current inflation:

Belgium has recalled its ambassador to South Korea after his wife allegedly assaulted two employees of a shop in Seoul, an incident that elicited widespread public anger in South Korea.


According to the AP, the Belgian Embassy said Foreign Affairs Minister Sophie Wilmès had decided that it was in the best interest of bilateral relations to terminate Ambassador Peter Lescouhier's tenure as Belgium's ambassador to Seoul, a position he has held for three years. It's been said that he will depart this summer, but an exact date hasn't been released.

Authored by Patricia Tolson via The Epoch Times,


On Monday, May 31, Americans from sea to shining sea will observe Memorial Day. However, veterans are quick to remind you: “It’s not about us.”



“Monday is not about us,” Sergeant J.O. Batten, Commander of VFW Post 8713 in Brooksville, Florida told The Epoch Times.


“It’s about the men on that wall out there. A lot of people don’t realize that.”



Batten, a United States Marine, served in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969.







“The wall” is a granite monument, which stands guard at the front door of VFW. It bears the names of a group of men known as “The Brooksville Eight,” men who were killed in action during the Vietnam War.

The title of our recently published mid-year outlook – Now the Hard Part – captures the conundrum market participants face: early-cycle timing, mid-cycle conditions and late-cycle valuations.







It is unusual to see this confluence, especially because it was only a little over a year ago that global risk markets were reeling and recording cyclical lows. Thus, despite our economists' call for strong global economic growth supported by the largest fiscal stimulus, the largest monetary easing and the highest consumer savings rates in post-war history, the investment recommendations from our strategists have a more subdued tone…]]></summary>

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday walked back comments made by the agency’s chief, who suggested earlier in the day that the federal government was “taking a very close look” at the idea of requiring vaccine passports to enter or leave the United States.



“Looking ahead to summer, Europe and other countries are going to open up. Could we see vaccine passports to travel internationally either into or out of the U.S.?” an ABC “Good Morning America” host asked Alejandro Mayorkas, head of the DHS.


“We’re taking a very close look at that,” Mayorkas responded.

A search is ongoing for three crew members reported missing from a roll-on/roll-off (ro/ro) vessel that sank off the coast of Japan early Friday morning.  The MV Byakko sank at about 2:40 a.m. local time after colliding with the chemical tanker Ulsan Pioneer just before midnight in the Seto Inland Sea, Reuters reported. The Byakko reportedly sank about 2.5 miles off the coast of Imabari.


Nine of the Byakko’s 12 crew members were said to have been rescued by the Japanese coast guard and nearby ships.

Just a couple months before that—in the earliest days of the COVID-19 scare—Congress passed a $2.2 trillion bill called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. The money was supposed to go to the millions of isolated Americans who had their paychecks interrupted during the pandemic.

Government bodies have been asked to check and report on employees who own Teslas in Zhejiang and Guangxi. Employees are being "forbidden" from driving into certain official areas, due to supposed security risks, the report notes. 


Other official Chinese bodies are following suit. The China Meteorological Administration, for example, has already told its employees not to b…]]></summary>

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


That the era of stability has ended and a new era of increasingly chaotic volatility has begun is not on anyone's radar as a possibility.


The standard debate about the future of the economy is: which will we get, high inflation or a deflationary collapse of defaults and asset bubbles popping?


The debate goes round and round in widening circles of complexity as analysts delve into every nuance of the debate.


A recent conversation with my friend A.T. raised a third possibility few seem to consider: increasingly chaotic volatility will be the new normal, as wild swings between inflation and deflation will increase in amplitude and feroci…]]></summary>

Get ready for $5 per gallon gasoline - especially if you live in California.


At least, that was the contention of a new WSJ op-ed that claims higher taxes and environmental regulations are both driving up the price of gas. 


Author Allysia Finley notes that the average cost at the pump in California is now $4.18 a gallon, pointing out that in 2017, Democrats in the state's legislature raised a tax on each gallon by 20.8 cents over three years. 


California drivers are now paying an astonishing average of 63 cents a gallon in state and local taxes, compared an average of 36.8 cents elsewhere in the country. 


The reasoning for the price hike was to repair the state's infrastructure, but …]]></summary>

The “Everything Bubble” has jumped from hyperbole to literal truth in just a couple of years, as more and more assets enter “crazy expensive/extremely reckless” territory. The latest addition to the list is collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), which are created when a bank lends money to a less-than-creditworthy company and then bundles that loan with a bunch of similar loans into bonds for sale to yield-starved pension funds and bond funds.


There’s a legitimate place in the market for this kind of security, as long as everyone understands the risks. But in financial bubbles, banks’ insatiable hunger for fees combines with bond buyers’ desperate need for income to cloud everyone’s jud…]]></summary>

Wholesaling real estate is the process of finding a deeply discounted home and passing it along to an end investor. Bearing fast cash, wholesalers are flooding low-income neighborhoods, seeking distressed homeowners who want to sell quickly. Record low mortgage rates, low housing inventory, and a real estate frenzy have increased the amount of wholesaling conducted nationwide since the pandemic as many were lured in by YouTube tutorials. 


The entire strategy behind wholesaling is finding a discounted property, get it under contract, and then flip it to an interested buyer for a quick profit. Bloomberg reports some wholesalers are using strong-arm tactics and misinformation to force sales. Wholesaling…]]></summary>

Davos really do think they are too clever by half. Despite prognostications to the contrary, negotiations with Iran over a new JCPOA are nearing completion which Biden/Obama will sign off on after putting up a bit more token resistance to lifting sanctions.


Why do I say this? Nordstream 2.


Biden backed down on Nordstream 2 and, at The Davos Crowd’s insistence, he will back down on the JCPOA.







Davos needs cheap energy into Europe. That’s ultimately what the JCPOA was all about. The basic framework for the deal is still there. While the U.S. will kick and scream a bit about sanctions relief, Iran will be back into the oil market and make it possible for Europe to on…]]></summary>

The US Air Force (USAF) is experimenting with the idea to harvest space solar power that will be beamed back to Earth as usable energy. 


The US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) shared a video on YouTube describing how the solar power satellite Arachne would work. 







AFRL Director Brig. Gen. Heather Pringle, quoted by Breaking Defense, said the critical design review of Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research Project (SSPIDR) would be conducted this summer. 


SSPIDR aims to use an Arachne satellite that would convert energy generated from the sun to radio frequency and beam it down to a land-based antenna. Once the radio frequency hits the antenna, it will be converted to useable power. 


If SSPIDR is successful, it could one day give the US military a great advantage on the modern battlefield and an unlimited source of energy for forward operating bases. This will also allow for bases to power future weapons, such as lasers and rail guns. 


At the moment, the military requires massive supply chains and convoys to receive not just energy power generation equipment but also fuel to power generators at remote bases. 


"Ensuring that a forward operating base maintains reliable power is one of the most dangerous parts of military ground operations. Convoys and supply lines are a major target for adversaries," the narrator of a new AFRL video said. 





Well, this appears to be one way the military is attempting to "go green."

Ransomware has seeped into the mainstream consciousness thanks to the recent shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline. Crippled by a ransomware attack, Colonial ended up paying a $4.4 million ransom in bitcoins to free itself from its attackers. In the meantime, the U.S. Eastern Seaboard suffered from gasoline shortages.







What is ransomware? It is malicious software that takes control of a computer, say, by encrypting files or threatening to publicly expose data. The ransomware operator only releases that control after receiving a ransom payment, usually Bitcoin but sometimes Monero.

Putin reportedly welcomed Lukashenko to the Friday meeting with the remarks: "Thank you for coming here, as we agreed even before the current outburst of emotions," He emphasized further, "Yes, it is an outburst of emotions," before saying, "But we have topics to discuss without these developments."

Finally, after a week of false starts, the “buy signals” kicked in, and the markets mustered a rally. As we stated last week:



“With markets deeply oversold on a short-term basis and with signals at levels that generally precede short-term rallies, the rally on Thursday and Friday was not unexpected. Notably, the S&P 500 held support at the 50-dma and rallied back into the previous trading range. 


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq triggered its short-term “buy signal,” which will likely provide some relative outperformance over the S&P 500. It will be important for the Nasdaq to hold above the 50-dma into next week“

The above number is often used, even by conservatives and libertarians, as justification for the initial lockdowns.

The oil falling from the sky was the result of a "flare incident" that took place Limetree Bay refinery; the incident shot oil up into the sky and it was carried west by the wind before raining down on parts of the island, according to CNN. 


As a result of the incident, the US Environmental Protection Agency ordered an emergency, 60-day shutdown of the plant, citing an "imminent risk" to public health, the report says.

A north Missouri businessman who was involved in the largest organic fraud scheme in American history has been sentenced to probation and fined. According to KTTN, federal prosecutors in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sentenced Steven Whiteside of Chilicothe to three years probation and a fine of 45-thousand dollars.







Two other Northwest Missouri men were sentenced to federal prison for their roles in the 142-million dollar grain fraud scheme, which federal prosecutors describe as the “Field of Schemes.”

Change the incentives, and the outcomes change.


Ecologist Howard Odum provided a profound insight into human expansion, stagnation and collapse. He argued that humans are wired to maximize power output (i.e., consumption) rather than maximize efficiency.


In other words, humans are wired to strip the tree of every ripe fruit and throw a party, have more children and use the surplus food to feed an army of conquest. Efficient use of resources is simply not part of what I term Wetware 1.0, the set of tools that was selected and optimized over the past 200,000 years for small hunter-gatherer tribes roaming an apparently near-infinite worl…]]></summary>

China launched an automated cargo rocket hauling supplies for the country's new space station late Saturday from the tropical island of Hainan in the South China Sea. 


A Long March-7 Y3 rocket carrying the Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft blasted off at 8:55 pm local time from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, state-run media Global Times reported.

The Tianzhou spacecraft is tasked with refueling the Tianhe space station core cabin for maintenance in orbit and also provides living necessities for future crewed missions at the space station. 







The Chinese space agency expects 11 launches through the end of this year to deliver two more modules for the Tiangong Space Station, additional supplies, and a three-member crew. Today's launch marks the second within a month. 







Apart from launch and eventual docking at the new space station, the rocket itself is set to fall back to Earth in an uncontrolled manner. Well, that's at least what happened earlier this month after the launch. There was no statement from Beijing about reentry plans for the rocket. 


Beijing isn't part of the International Space Station (ISS), primarily due to the U.S. The ISS has been in low Earth orbit for a little more than 22 years and could reach its lifespan by the end of this decade. Russia has already announced it would be withdrawing from the ISS to build its own.

A new grading policy, put forth by the Baltimore City School Board, Tuesday, will allow students who are struggling and failing classes to move up to the next grade level due to the virus pandemic, according to local news Fox 45. 


Instead of holding back students, Baltimore City Public School System's (BCPSS) new grading policy will push up struggling students who failed classes during the pandemic and have their educational status tested during the fall semester to determine what skills they missed during virtual learning classes. 







Chief Academic Officer Joan Dabrowski said the new policy is intended to "avoid the punitive approach of failing students."

Last year, we discussed the controversy over the acting Northwestern Law Dean declaring publicly to “I am James Speta and I am a racist.”


He was followed by Emily Mullin, executive director of major gifts, who announced, “I am a racist and a gatekeeper of white supremacy. I will work to be better.” 


The public confessions reflect the view that all white people are racist due to their race and privilege — a view contested by some as itself a form of racial intolerance or bias.


Now one of Brandeis’ Assistant Deans, Kate Slater, has triggered a similar controversy after declaring “all white people are racists.”

According to JPMorgan's Daniel Silver, as of this moment some 23 - all republican - states have announced at least some form of early reduction in pandemic-related unemployment insurance benefits ahead of the September expiration at the federal level. These programs, he suggests, are likely limiting labor supply, generating a potential economic argument for ending these programs early.


A glance at the following chart - which shows the number of US job opening vs the number of Americans who remain on some form of Pandemic unemployment benefit, would suggest that Silver is right.

The US dollar is on the verge of breaking down to the lowest level since 2014. 







This is not all that surprising. After all, the US money supply continues to grow at a rapid pace relative to other countries and quantitative easing is likely to continue at full pace through the end of 2021. Meanwhile, other countries like the UK, Canada and others are already telegraphing rate hikes. Not only that, but the US budget deficit as a percent of GDP – which has a tight correlation with the level of the US dollar index – is set to explode through 2022 and beyond. The ballooning budget deficit suggests a level of 70 or 80 on the US dollar index ov…]]></summary>

Technical problems onboard a massive crude tanker Friday led to the shutdown of Turkey's Bosphorus Strait. 


The vessel veered off course in the Bosphorus Strait, a narrow waterway that divides the city of Istanbul and connects the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.







The crude oil tanker RAVA disrupted vessel activity for three hours Friday as tugboats had to intervene and prevented the vessel from plowing into the shoreline of Istanbul's Yenikoy district. The entire operation took eight tugs and five other vessels. The straight was reopened later in the day.

Democrat lawmakers in particular have long pushed for massively increased federal aid for public housing across the country following a decades-long decline amid a perpetual funding crisis that's left large mid-20th century urban housing complexes derelict and crumbling.


Nowhere has the crisis been felt more than (as expected) New York City, where most of the some 325 housing projects owned by New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) are dilapidated to the point of becoming uninhabitable, for years if not decades facing interminable problems like mold and rats, water leaks and damaged roots, as well as no heat, elevators going out, and lead paint hazards.

That’s quite an achievement.  Especially when you consider the state’s rainy-day fund will hit an all-time high of $4.5 billion.  Federal coronavirus stimulus is also bringing $6 billion into the state.

A study on Lifetime Earnings in the United States over Six Decades is worth a close look.


The study shows the United States shows a "wage stagnation of average earnings and a rise in income inequality since the 1970s." The charts are based on US Social Security Administration (SSA) records over 57 years.

Evanston, Illinois made headlines earlier this year by becoming the first city in the US to authorize "reparations" in the form of payments to compensate Black Americans for abuses done to family members. The Chicago suburb' City Council voted back in March to distribute $400K to eligible black households, with each qualifying family receiving up to $25K for homeownership and or improvement grants, as well as mortgage assistance.


But while proponents on the left praised the move as unprecedented, it turns out that those who designed the proposal were careful to ensure the word "reparations" was nowhere near it. In fact, a lengthy Bloomberg piece telling the story of how the proposal came to be s…]]></summary>

US embassies and consulates across the globe this week flew Black Lives Matter (BLM) flags after being authorized and encouraged to do so for the first time ever in a memo by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. It's now expected to be a regular practice, particularly in instances of race-related events or memorials.


Just ahead of the May 25 one-year anniversary of George Floyd's death, a State Department memo was sent to all diplomatic staff worldwide saying that it "supports the use of the term 'Black Lives Matter' in messaging content". It further encouraged speeches and commemorative events related to diplomatic engagements on the anniversary "and beyond". Subsequently on Tuesday BLM flags were photographed flying …]]></summary>

What kind of abysmal social and economic conditions would make at least five separate counties of US voters want to flee a state to join the borders of another state? Well, all it takes is a cult of insane Marxists running the entire state into the ground from the safety of their metropolitan communes while demanding that people submit their undying fealty to the draconian medical mandates of an elitist minority. Yeah, things have to get pretty bad to inspire so many people into leaving and taking half the state with them.

As demands to cancel the Tokyo Olympics intensify, Japan on Friday extended a state of emergency in Tokyo and eight other prefectures until June 20 as hospitals struggle to handle a rise in COVID-sickened patients.







The state of emergency had previously been slated to end on May 31, but strains on the medical system are still too intense for Japanese officials to be entirely comfortable with the current situation. Japan has seen a record number of COVID patients in critical condition in recent days, even as the number of new infections has slowed. This has prompted worries about infectious new COVID "variants" spreading in the country with the start of the Olympics just a few weeks away.

Sen. Paul has been arguing with Dr. Fauci about the merits of the research and whether they're outweighed by the risks of deadly lab leaks for weeks now.

One industry that did not suffer was that which was and is devoted to writing scientific papers on the Coronavirus. Talk about boom times! A report from October 2020 estimates that 87,000 studies have been written and published in some form on the topic. It’s surely more than 100,000 by now.

Election season in Mexico has always been a dangerous game, with politicians regularly knocked off by cartels seeking to install 'friendly' candidates by process of elimination. 







Since the start of the electoral process in Sep. 2020, eighty-eight politicians have been murdered nationwide, according to TeleSur. The most recent, Citizens Movement (MC) candidate Alma Barragan, was shot to death while driving by unidentified assailants, just a few hours after she attended a campaign event. Barragan marks the third murdered candidate in Guanajuato alone ahead of the region's June 6 election.

Among the "new" things that Americans will notice during this year's post-Covid Memorial Day will be skyrocketing prices at the pump.


Drivers are in store for the highest prices in seven years this summer, Reuters writes this week, as retail gas prices are the most expensive since 2014 at about $3.04 per gallon. 







And those prices have nowhere to go but up, as a year's worth of pent up demand for leisure activities, vacation and summer sun come to fruition over the next three or four months. This could drive up prices even further during peak travel weeks during the summer.

Joe Biden is cruising, in a happy-place few politicians reach. Outside of a few grumpy right-wing outlets he faces almost no hostile press questioning, political threats within his own party are minimal, and his approval rating, if one believes the latest Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, hovers at an astonishing 64%.





Biden has the press paper-trained to a degree we haven’t seen in modern times. Not even at the height of the media’s drooling love affair with Barack Obama — a phenomenon I confess I was part of — did we ever see such enthusiastic, reflexive backing of White House messaging.

Authored by Peter Schiff via SchiffGold.com,


It’s dawning on many investors that our post-Covid financial problems may not be as easily solved as Washington claims...







The latest clue that trouble is brewing has come from the sudden and dramatic arrival of inflation. On May 12, it was revealed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) had risen 4.2% year-over-year, the fastest pace since 2008.


Some tried to downplay concern by pointing out that the gains resulted from the “base effect” of comparing current prices with the artificially depressed “Covid lockdown” prices of March and April of last year. But that ignores the more alarming trend of near-term price acceleration.

America's top virologist, Anthony Fauci, argued in 2012 that the risks of a lab accident sparking a pandemic are outweighed by the potential benefits of manipulating viruses via gain-of-function research, according to previously unsurfaced remarks reported by Sharri Markson via The Australian.







"In an unlikely but conceivable turn of events, what if that scientist becomes infected with the virus, which leads to an outbreak and ultimately triggers a pandemic?"

Update (1330ET): President Biden just released the much-leaked and strawman'd Fiscal Year 2022 budget request to Congress on Friday, the first formal budget of his presidency.


The topline budget request for 2022 is $6 trillion. But of this, as we detailed below, only $300 billion is new spending requested for next year. Instead, the vast majority of it will be spent on programs the government is obligated by law to fund, like Medicare, Social Security and interest on the national debt. 



“Put together, this budget is an agenda for robust, durable economic growth and broadly shared prosperity,” said Shalanda Young, Biden’s acting White House budget director.

It was back in February when we first said that (almost) nobody was paying attention to the "mind-boggling liquidity" that was about to hit the markets in the form of hundreds of billions in cash released from the Treasury's TGA account held at the Fed. This historic liquidity injection by the Treasury and not the Fed (which continues to this day to inject $120BN in liquidity monthly from its ongoing QE) was, as we put it, a form of backdoor QE, which would push asset prices higher and depress real rates.

In what was at least the third flashing-red headline for the day referencing the scandal-plagued Swiss Bank, moments ago Bloomberg reported that Credit Suisse, still humiliated from the billions it lost on Archegos and Greensill and countless subsequent banker terminations and defections, has temporarily barred clients from pulling their cash from a feeder fund that that was sold as an investment option for rich clients at the bank’s wealth arm, and which invests with Renaissance Technologies "after the str…]]></summary>

We may have a little more insight as to reports yesterday that Tesla was pre-paying for semiconductor parts to secure supply. Yesterday, we guessed that Tesla's new "pre-payment" terms could be a result of suppliers showing little patience with the automaker, who has over $6 billion in payables.


But a new report overnight from DigiTimes Asia sheds more light on the situation, leading us to believe that Tesla could simply be short of supplies and desperately in need of parts to be able to hit production targets. 


The report notes that Tesla is "scrambling" for instrument cluster supplies:

With Tesla falling out of favor in China, one domestic EV maker, Li Auto, is predicting a tailwind.


The Chinese Tesla rival, which produces the Li One SUV, predicts that its sales will rise at least 15% in from April to June as a result of Tesla running "foul of angry Chinese customers," SCMP reported on Wednesday. 


The company's Li One SUV competes with Tesla's Model Y. It is an extended-range sport-utility vehicle (SUV) that is priced at 328,000 yuan (US$51,316), according to the report.

Lockheed Martin and General Motors are teaming to develop the next-generation lunar vehicle for NASA's upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon. 


The Artemis program aims to land astronauts on the lunar surface by the midpoint of the decade. For exploration purposes, astronauts will need "surface mobility that is critical to enable and sustain long-term exploration of the lunar surface. These next-generation rovers will dramatically extend the range of astronauts," a Lockheed press release read. 







The new lunar vehicle "may allow astronauts to explore the lunar surface in unprecedented fashion and support discovery in places where humans have never gone before," the defense contract continued.

The COVID-19 pandemic is ending with mass vaccinations. So is the national quarantine. The rioting, looting, and arson that began in the summer of 2020 is finally sputtering out.


The acrimony over the 2020 election is fading. Trump Derangement Syndrome became abstract when Donald Trump left office and was ostracized from social media.


In other words, the American people are slowly regaining their senses after the epidemic of mass hysteria that gripped the nation last year.







But many Americans wonder whether what Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and the hard left wrought last year will last when the nation is no longer gripped by 2020 madness.

By now everyone has seen some iteration of this chart (most recently discussed here), which shows that whereas stocks are generally flat over longer periods of time during the regular "cash", or day session, they tend to melt up during the overnight hours when liquidity is far lower and when the "pajama trades" come out and play.







And while there is no single, widely accepted reason for this "overnight drift", the post-closed meltup phenomenon has been one of the most popular and recurring strategies in equity markets, with many traders selling spoos when the day session begins and then re-buying at the market close in pursuit of scarce alpha.

WeWork co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann may well be remembered as the worst CEO ever. But that hasn't stopped him from collecting billions of dollars in payouts on his way out the door at WeWork, as SoftBank's Masayoshi Son was forced to effectively bribe Neumann to relinquish control of the flailing office rental company.







A legal fight erupted when SoftBank tried to renege on some $3 billion it owed to Neumann and other early investors, but it appears this issue was settled out of court.


But according to the latest documents released by the company, Neumann has just received even more goodies from the firm, including a final "enhanced" package worth roughly one qua…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['It Would Be Detrimental To A Lot Of Companies': Jamie Dimon Slams Biden Tax Plan

            
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon went scorched earth on President Biden's tax plan, which would raise the current corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, arguing that it would result in capital flight out of the United States.







"The tax increase is actually four times what the tax decrease was from 2017," Dimon said during a Thursday virtual hearing before the US House Committee on Financial Services. "You all know the phrase the devil is in the details, well the details here are all that matter, not the top line of 28%."


"If you want to have a healthy, growing, competitive America against the rest of the world, you need a global, competitive tax rate," Dimon added. "It would be detrimental to a lot of companies, it would push a lot of capital overseas."





Dimon cast doubt on the Biden tax plan earlier this month, calling it 'a little crazy,' however today's comments mark the strongest pushback yet from the top banker.


"We’re just throwing money. It doesn’t work," Dimon said in a recorded interview for the JPMorgan general membership meeting on May 6, adding "I’m concerned about how the money’s going to be spent."


"We already waste tremendous sums of money."

China's recent aggressive crackdown on soaring commodity prices (going as far as dragging the PBOC's monetary regime into it, with the central bank stating this morning that the surging yuan is in no way a response to explosive commodity prices, honestly), has provided the world's deflationists with some hope that the recent huge spike in commodity prices may be coming to an end.

Grocery and liquor stores would be barred from selling beer, wine and liquor after 10 p.m. if Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot gets her way. She said the move would curb crime by stopping gatherings outside liquor stores and help recovering bars and restaurants.







Mayor Lightfoot introduced an amendment Wednesday that would permanently ban Chicago stores from selling beer, wine and other alcoholic drinks after 10 p.m.

A Russian Navy surveillance ship parked in international waters off Kauai, an island in the Central Pacific, part of the Hawaiian archipelago, has delayed a Missile Defense Agency missile test, according to Honolulu Star-Advertiser. 


The US Pacific Fleet confirmed Wednesday that it "is aware of the Russian vessel operating in international waters in the vicinity of Hawaii, and will continue to track it through the duration of its time here." 


The ship has been operating in international waters just 13 nautical miles west of Kauai for several days. The vessel is not broadcasting an automatic identification system signal. 



"Through maritime patrol aircraft, surface ships and joint capabilities, we can closely monitor all vessels in the Indo-Pacific area of operations," US Pacific Fleet's statement continued. 



U.S. Naval Institute News first identified the presence of the spy ship, indicating it was a Russian Navy Vishnya-class auxiliary general intelligence (AGI) ship Kareliya (SSV-535). Honolulu Star-Advertiser then expanded on this and said the vessel is in the vicinity of the Pacific Missile Range and has "delayed" a missile test. 







The question remains: Why does a Russian signals intelligence vessel sit off the coast of Kauai? Is Moscow sending the Biden administration a message of new strength in the Pacific?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Retail Investors Storm Back Into The Market: This Is What They Are Buying

            
It was less than than three weeks ago when we first noted that retail participation in stock trading had seemingly collapsed after a wild start to the year, with JPMorgan reporting that US retail investors share in equity trading declined sharply in March after a strong January and February, and a record high share of 28% in December.







And while April and the start of May exhibited a similar continued decline in both retail participation and performance of "retail favorite" stocks, which underperformed the broader market by 8% since mid-March, things have changed dramatically in the past two weeks and as Goldman notes in a new piece discussing the "Recent performance of stocks with high levels of retail activity", stocks with high retail trading volumes have outperformed by 5% since May 12th, with half of this outperformance occurring yesterday (Wednesday). 


Echoing JPMorgan's observations, Goldman then notes that while declines in daily trades at retail brokers showed significant declines last week (DARTs), leading to fresh concerns that retail trading activity was on the decline - with many going so far as to conclude that retail investors were no longer investing their stimmies - this too appears to have been the wrong conclusion, as the rise in retail stocks yesterday and especially today, when both GME and AMC have soared...







... suggesting it may be too early to call an end to elevated retail activity.







So what are retail investors buying? Based on Goldman's “small-lot trading” analysis, these are the 50 stocks where retail was the most active yesterday in shares and options.







Not enough? Here are the stocks with high “small lot” trading activity in Options

Authored by Jeff Harris via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace & Prosperity,


You would think that during the worst Pandemic since the 1918 Spanish Flu life insurance companies would be hedging their bets to avoid major losses from Covid-19. 


I haven’t written a life policy for several years so I was wondering what was going on?


I called one of the brokers I deal with that interacts with hundreds of big life insurers to get an inside look into how the Covid crisis has changed their business.





Imagine my surprise when she said it was pretty much business as usual!


Last year when the hysteria was just getting ramped up she did say the companies temporarily tightened up underwriting and reduced the amount of coverage they would offer. But as time went by and the hard data came rolling in those same companies went back to business as usual.
I asked her specifically if life insurers wanted a Covid test as part of the underwriting process and she said none that she was aware of.


Hmm, that’s pretty interesting isn’t it?


The most lethal pandemic in decades descends on the globe with deadly mutations taking millions of innocent lives and the life insurance companies couldn’t care less.
I also asked if the cost per thousand of coverage had increased due to Covid and again she said no.


Rates were pretty much the same as they were before the Covid Pandemic ravaged the earth.


Life Insurance companies are very risk adverse. 


They don’t like losing money to unnecessary claims.


The fact they’re treating Covid as a nonevent should be an indicator that something is very wrong with the whole narrative.

Campbell said this week that the U.S. was "entering a period of intense competition with China as the government running the world’s second-biggest economy becomes ever more tightly controlled by President Xi Jinping," according to Bloomberg.

Real Vision managing editor Ed Harrison welcomes Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, back to the Daily Briefing to update viewers on how the bond market is reacting to the re-opening of the economy and the sustained dovishness of the Federal Reserve. Bianco analyzes how the Fed’s bias towards employment within its dual mandate is impacting inflation expectations and bond yields, and he and Harrison discuss today’s jobless claims within that context as well as ballooning budget deficits and central bank balance sheet expansion.

We knew it would be a crazy day for today's reverse repo early this morning, when the overnight GCF repo rate traded at -0.01% and refused to rise, an indication that there was far too much money chasing good collateral.







Looking at the scramble for repo, interbroker dealer Wrightson ICAP said on Thursday morning that it saw Reverse Repo volumes rising to around $470 billion Thursday, though the risks are “still tilted to the high side.”


They were, because moments ago the Fed announced that at 1:15pm some 50 counterparties (up from 46 on Wednesday) parked $485.329BN in reserves with the Fed (in exchange for the generous rate of 0.000%), which was up $35BN overnight, up $134BN in the past wee…]]></summary>

On Wednesday Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced efforts to combat the growing trend of rampant and unpredictable blackouts experienced across parts of the country of over 80 million people at the start of a hot summer, particularly in already strained major cities. By many accounts what was somewhat already a "norm" under American sanctions has come early this year - namely the sporadic blackouts, increasingly angering the population just ahead of a key presidential election in June.

There's been a lot of speculation this year about what it might take for western governments like the US to meet the carbon emissions targets laid out in the Paris Accords, which President Biden has enthusiastically rejoined. One study by the IEA concluded that all oil and gas firms would have to halt new projects in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

After nearly 18 months of punishing anyone who suggested that COVID-19 might have originated in a Wuhan lab, Facebook has decided to stop removing posts which claim the virus was man-made or manufactured, a company spokesperson told Politico on Wednesday.







The move comes after the Wall Street Journal reported that three lab workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were hospitalized in late 2019 with symptoms consistent with the virus - building on previous reporting by the Washington Post's Josh Rogin.

Authored by Mark Glennon via Wirepoints.org,


Most Illinoisans are unaware, but their General Assembly is poised to pass a resolution for a state constitutional amendment, the consequences of which are hard to overstate. It would vastly expand union power, permanently, particularly public union power that is already extreme.







Limited media coverage so far characterizes the amendment mostly as an attempt to permanently ban right-to-work and lock in current worker protections. That would be bad enough, since the majority of states are now right to work including nearby competitors Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana and Iowa. And Illinois is already an outlier in how much power it has given to …]]></summary>

Summary: Chinese equities were rallying 3.6% today on signals from the Chinese government to curb inflationary pressures from rising commodity markets reducing inflation expectations and boosting the earnings outlook. US equities are currently valued at a valuation premium to Chinese equities which suggest historically that Chinese equities could outperform over the next 26 weeks. The two country's technology sectors are equally valued on a 2-year forward basis on EV/EBITDA but with a valuation skew on Chinese technology mega caps making them more attractive on valuation. The long-term growth outlook is better for Chinese technology companies and thus we expect the market to beg…]]></summary>

Dozens of people are missing in north-western Nigeria after a boat carrying 200 capsized on Wednesday, according to Reuters, citing a state spokesperson.



"The boat was ferrying about 200 passengers" coming from the neighboring country of Niger, said Yahaya Sarki, a spokesperson for the governor of Kebbi.


"Their locally made wooden boat capsized mid-water," Sarki said. "Bodies are still being recovered. We can't ascertain the number for now."



The boat was reportedly overloaded when it suddenly snapped into two in the middle of the Niger River. 







Reports of how many people on board vary from news agency to news agency—some say between 160 and 200.


Authorities in Kebbi State told the BBC that first responders had been dispatched to the scene to search for survivors. 



"A rescue operation is underway, but only 22 survivors and one dead body have been recovered," a local official reportedly said.



Qasimu Umar Wara, a resident of Wara town, told Reuters the passengers were returning from a newly-discovered gold vein in Niger. 



"They usually go there in the evenings and return to Wara in the morning," he said. "Most of them are petty traders, food vendors and the local miners."



The wooden boat is reportedly rated for 80 passengers, and the accident is likely due to overloading.

It's bad enough that Melinda reportedly divorced Bill over his insistence on maintaining ties with Jeffrey Epstein, something that has stoked speculation about whether Gates might face more sexual harassment allegations (sure enough, reports have emerged claiming he was essentially pushed out at Microsoft over improper behavior involving a female subordinate) or that he might be caught up in the…]]></summary>

Following calls last summer from groups such as Black Lives Matter to “defund the police,” a number of city officials are now walking back statements to go through with cutting funding to law enforcement due to surges in crime levels.


The Minneapolis City Council several months ago voted to approve $6.4 million more in funding to the police department, coming after a number of councilmembers last year pledged to completely abolish the department.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


A professor with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine has said that there is a general dismissal of the fact that more than half of all Americans have developed natural immunity to the coronavirus and that it constitutes “one of the biggest failures of our current medical leadership.”







Dr. Marty Makary made the comments during a recent interview, noting that “natural immunity works” and it is wrong to vilify those who don’t want the vaccine because they have already recovered from the virus.


Makary criticised “the most slow, reactionary, political CDC in American history” for not clearly communicati…]]></summary>

According to a report from The New York Times, US troops are expected to be out of Afghanistan by early to mid-July, well before the September 11th deadline set by President Biden.


Unnamed US officials told the Times that Washington’s allies are also expected to be out by July, although Germany is apparently struggling to keep up the pace. US Central Command on Tuesday said the Afghanistan withdrawal process was about 16 to 25 percent complete.

Activist firm Engine No. 1 has won at least two seats on the board of Exxon Mobile Corp. following a multi-month battle over the oil giant's board of directors to change the company's path towards one centered around achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner, according to WSJ.







Engine No. 1, an upstart hedge fund, owns a tiny 0.02% stake in Exxon, has gone on a blitz against the company since December to shift away from fossil fuels to a zero-carbon world. The fund was founded by veteran hedge fund investor Chris James.

Just a few weeks ago, the market was rife with speculation that amid galloping inflation, the Fed would almost certainly breach the topic of the infamous taper during its June 16 FOMC meeting, and if not then, then no later than the September 22 meeting, which takes place just after the late-August Jackson Hole central banker outing in which most of the Fed's "radical" ideas in the past decade have been introduced.

Five people were arrested overnight in Portland, Oregon after a riot broke out on the anniversary of George Floyd’s death.


The quintet was part of a crowd who set a fire in a dumpster next to the Justice Center, a building that houses a jail and law enforcement offices, while chanting “Burn the building down,” according to a Portland Police Bureau incident summary and photographs and video footage from the scene.

IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told Financial Times that Iran has reached uranium purity levels that "only countries making bombs are reaching" after routinely ramping up enrichment since Trump pulled out of the Obama-era JCPOA back in May 2018.

The long-awaited, though partial, release of a memorandum from the Justice Department this week left many “frustrated,” as predicted by the Washington Post, in Washington. The reason is what it did not contain.  Critics had sought the memo as the “smoking gun” to show how former Attorney General Bill Barr scuttled any obstruction charges against Donald Trump.


Instead, the memo showed the opposite. 







The staff of the OLC actually found that the allegations did not meet the standard of obstruction even without any defenses or privileges related to Trump’s office.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It Reeks Of Deflation After Second Stellar Treasury Auction In A Row

            
After yesterday's blockbuster 2Y auction which pushed bond yields sharply lower and which we said was an indication that the inflationary storm has passed with bond traders no longer expecting any rate hikes for the foreseeable future, moments ago the stench of deflation was positively rancid after today's $61BN 5-Year auction was just as almost as solid as Tuesday's auction.


Printing at a high yield of 0.788%, the 2Y auction stopped 5.5bps below April's auction and also stopped through the When Issued 0.794% by 0.6bps, the first stop through for the tenor since Jan 2021.


Meanwhile, and like yesterday, the Bid to Cover jumped, rising from 2.31 last month to 2.49 today, the highest since Sept 2020 and obviously well above the six-auction average of 2.34.


The internals were also stellar with Indirects taking down a whopping 64.4%, the highest foreign award since August 2020 and far above the 57.9% recent average. And with Directs taking down a lower than average 14.9%, Dealers were left holding 20.8% of the auction, the lowest since August.







Overall, a stellar bond auction, and one which together with yesterday's 2Y auction suggests that demand for tomorrow's 7Y issuance will be vastly greater compared to the dismal 7Y bond sale in late February when the bellybuster auction was nearly a flop and sparked a major bond and stock market selloff.

The U.S. Department of Commerce says it will seek to double tariff rates on most Canadian softwood lumber, angering home builders. New rates vary by company. West Fraser goes from 9 percent to 11.4 percent, Canfor from 4.6 to 21 percent, Resolute Forest from 20.3 to 30.2 percent, and J.D. Irving from 4.2 to 15.8 percent.


The overall increase is from 9 percent to 18.32 percent.


Home builders, who had been urging for a removal of tariffs, expressed their disappointment.

Authored by Janita Kan via The Epoch Times,


Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on Monday said he was willing to support a Democrat-led bill that was passed by the House to create an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 breach of the U.S. Capitol.







Romney answered that he “would support the bill” when asked by reporters how he would vote if Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) starts a debate on the House bill, according to multiple congressional reporters. He is the first Republican in the Senate to do so.


The Utah senator’s comments come on the same day that Schumer vowed to bring the bill for a vote on the Senate floor.

Last week's good news of easing vessel congestion earlier this month outside the busiest U.S. gateway for trade with Asia showed a glimmer of hope that supply chain disruptions could subside had flipped last week as more containerships join the queue.  


Bloomberg data shows the number of containerships queuing off the coast of Los Angeles reached the highest in two weeks.


As of Sunday, 21 containerships were anchored waiting for entry into L.A.-Long Beach, compared with 19 a week earlier. The bottleneck peaked at around 40 vessels in the queue in early February and has steadily declined ever since, but the latest data shows progress could be reversing.

If you want to act in movies or on television in Hollywood, you must be a member of the Screen Actors Guild. That’s why the accession of a “SAG” card is such a momentous achievement for actors. It means they’re Hollywood legal as it were.







So why does acting professionally require union membership? The answer is very simple: SAG wants to prevent those yearning to be stars from flooding the market, and subsequently bidding starting wages down to zero.


It’s as old as the hills for actors and actresses to wistfully proclaim that “I just want a chance to show them what I can do.” Since they’re all looking for a break, it’s not unreasonable to specula…]]></summary>

Ever since China started allowing American money managers access to the hundreds of millions of middle class Chinese investors and savers via "joint ventures" with domestic firms, some of the biggest US buy-side firms, including BlackRock and Vanguard, have already launched their Chinese operations.


And now, after months of cajoling local regulators, it appears Goldman Sachs has just won approval to launch a wealth management venture of its own alongside ICBC, one of China's largest banks, the FT says.


So pretty soon, the Chinese elite will have the opportunity to join their American peers by becoming Goldman clients.

Subway franchisees recently started pushing the company to dramatically reduce the ongoing fees they pay the company in a bid to keep more of them in business.







But Subway is moving in the other direction. The sandwich giant’s newest franchise agreement increases their ongoing royalty payments by 25%, numerous sources told Restaurant Business. The result would send higher what many say is an already unusually high royalty rate at a time when the chain is closing more than 1,000 locations a year.

Oil prices ended marginally lower after a choppy day of investors tempering expectations of an early return of oil exporter Iran to international crude markets (bullish) and US virus cases falling rapidly ahead of Memorial Day travels (bullish) battling with the overall weakness in economic data and slop in US equity markets and lower bond yields (bearish).



"Oil prices... remain at high levels as the high season for oil demand is approaching and as restrictions are lifted in much of Europe and the United States," said Louise Dickson, oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy.



The swings in crude and product stocks in the last couple of weeks have been noisy thanks to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown. This week we should start to put that behind us, although product stocks may still be impacted.


API




	
Crude -439k (-1mm exp)

	

	

	
Cushing -1.153mm

	

	

	
Gasoline -1.986mm (-1.1mm exp)

	

	

	
Distillates -5.137mm (-2mm exp)

	


Analysts expected inventory draws across the board this week, and they were right with Gasoline stocks down notably more than expected for the 7th straight week...

WTI hovered around $65.90 ahead of the API data and pushed back above $66 after the print.








"Crude prices are in wait-and-see mode until the fifth round of negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal are done," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, noting "Energy traders need to know how much Iranian crude is going to hit the market."



Iran may have some 69 million barrels of oil in floating storage waiting on tankers to travel to buyers when U.S. sanctions on its crude oil exports are removed, estimates from E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers cited by Bloomberg showed on Tuesday.

SPACs have officially fallen out of favor. 


The SPAC bubble burst started with fallen angel Nikola Motors and has since continued, with short sellers and market skeptics unveiling the less than savory elements to numerous names brought public through the merger-style transaction that allows companies to go public quicker, and with less red tape, than the traditional IPO process.


Chamath Palihapitiya, once heralded as the "king of SPACs" is now more likely to be seen as the face of a SPAC bubble that looks as though it is in the process of popping. 


As a result of the bubble bursting, banks are starting to "pass" on funding SPAC transactions. One recent example was Si…]]></summary>

Don't look now but the meme stocks are back.


Having crept higher in recent days, both Gamestop and AMC, the two most popular meme stocks which shook the hedge fund industry in February when several prominent hedge funds suffered massive losses on their shorts, have exploded higher today, with GME up as much as 18%...







... and AMC close behind, up 14%.







The move may be a ramp in sympathy because while GME short interest is a pale shadow of its former glorious self...

Secretary of State Antony Blinken's Mideast trip where he first met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Tuesday was supposed to focus on maintaining the Israel-Gaza truce and finding a lasting solution toward preventing a future flair up of violence. 


However, an emboldened Netanyahu bluntly shared his thoughts on the impending restoration of the Iran nuclear deal while standing next to Blinken during the press conference that followed their meeting. As expected Netanyahu urged the US to stay away from the deal, forcing Blinken to quickly contradict the Israeli leader, leading to an awkward exchange among the close allies. It took a mere 90 seconds for Netanyahu…]]></summary>

Authored by Gary Galles via The Mises Institute,


It seems that every time something adverse happens in the labor market, it restarts the partisan battle between those currently in and out of power as to who is a better steward of the economy.







That was illustrated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics's (BLS) release of the job numbers for April, which made headlines when job growth, which was expected to surge, came in “unexpectedly” low. The 266,000 jobs created were only a quarter of some forecasts, which topped 1 million. Further, March job creation was also revised down by 146,000. And unemployment ticked up for the first time since the lockdown, despite a reportedly massive shortage of workers, as illustrated b…]]></summary>

What is a Quantum Computer?


The New Scientist answers the question What is a Quantum Computer?



Classical computers, which include smartphones and laptops, encode information in binary “bits” that can either be 0s or 1s. In a quantum computer, the basic unit of memory is a quantum bit or qubit.


For instance, eight bits is enough for a classical computer to represent any number between 0 and 255. But eight qubits is enough for a quantum computer to represent every number between 0 and 255 at the same…]]></summary>

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


Despite relentless positive promotion by the media and political elites, support for Black Lives Matter in America has dropped to a two year low.







An essay written by academics Jennifer Chudy and Hakeem Jefferson published by the New York Times analyzes how support for BLM soared to +20% in mid-2020 but rapidly dropped to only +5% – which is where it was in mid-2019.


The authors note that the figures serve to contradict “the idea that the country underwent a racial reckoning.”

Via Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com,


Economist John Williams, founder of ShadowStats.com, says the Federal Reserve has painted itself into such a tight corner with the economy it really has only two choices.  Williams says it comes down to “Inflation or Implosion.”







What would happen to the financial system if the Fed stopped printing massive amounts of money for stimulus and debt service?  Williams explains,



“You could see financial implosion by preventing liquidity being put into the system.  The system needs liquidity (freshly created dollars) to function. Without that liquidity, you would see more of an economic implosion than you have already seen.  In fact, I will contend that…]]></summary>

President Biden, a self-described 'devout Catholic,' will become the first US official in two decades not to attend Notre Dame's commencement ceremony, citing a 'scheduling conflict' according to the Catholic News Agency.







The news comes after 4,600 "members of the Notre Dame community" signed a petition urging college president Fr. John Jenkins not to invite Biden - the second Roman Catholic president, over his stance on abortion, according to Fox News. Of note, Biden was told in February by US Archbishop Joseph Naumann to stop calling himself a 'devout catholic' over his pro-abortion views.

Thanks to its very name - renewable energy - we can picture a time in the not-too-distant future when our need for non-renewable fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal will vanish. Indeed, the Biden administration has announced a breakthrough target of 2035 for fully eliminating U.S. reliance on those non-renewable fuels for the generation of electricity. That would be accomplished by “deploying carbon-pollution-free electricity-generating resources,” primarily the everlasting power of the wind and sun.

There's a lot of noise from the Biden administration, who claim to be addressing gun violence as an epidemic, but their efforts have only been for optics, as very little action has been taken so far. This past weekend, a dozen mass shootings were recorded across the country, according to CNN. 


Nonprofit research group Gun Violence Archive (GVA) reported that at least 12 mass shootings were observed in eight states, including Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia, Texas, and Minnesota.



This is the second straight year that the month of May has had 60+ mass shootings. https://t.co/xUBTCOf9xW

Inflation came in hot in April. Initially gold sold off on the news. But over the following week, there appears to have been something of a pivot in the market. Gold and the dollar both started behaving as one would expect in an inflationary environment. Peter Schiff said it looks like investors are starting to worry the Fed won’t fight inflation after all.







The markets have been by and large operating on the assumption that the Fed would stick to its playbook and tighten monetary policy to deal with increasing consumer prices. But Peter has been saying there is no way the Fed could fight inflation if it wants to. Inflation is propping up the economy. If the Fed raised rates and…]]></summary>

The Biden Administration is discussing hiking corporate taxes to pay for the proposed infrastructure spending package. While the goal is to ensure the “rich pay their fair share,” a look at history suggests changing tax rates will have very little impact on economic outcomes.

The fallacy of tax cuts,

	

	

	
Why tax cuts wouldn’t change corporate behavior; and,

New York City is officially back: almost 30 people were shot in New York City this past weekend - and that number was only up until about 2PM on Sunday. 


29 victims in total had been struck by gunfire by early evening Sunday, according to the New York Post, with one reported fatality. 


“These kids are having running gun battles and innocents are getting shot,” one veteran NYPD officer told the Post. “Nobody is interested in hearing how many shots are fired but if people knew how many shootings occurred where there are no victims — it’s by the grace of God."


Among those struck by gunfire over the weekend were a Manhattan federal prosecutor, Mollie Bracewell, who was dining outside in Brooklyn’s Prospect Heights, and Benjamin Bustamante, an innocent bystander walking nearby. 







The weekend hadn't even ended before one officer said "there were just two more right now", referring to additional shootings late Sunday. 


Shootings took place at Beach 30th Street and Seagirt Boulevard in Far Rockaway, Queens, among other locations throughout the city.


Two people were shot in that area after a "gang dispute" spilled out of a nearby park, the report says. 


And if "diversity" in your violent crimes is a major concern, as we know it probably is for Mayor De Blasio, it should be noted that in addition to the shootings, there was a fatal stabbing in Northern Brooklyn and a man who was beaten to death in the Northeast Bronx over the weekend as well.

Submitted by Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research


The inflation of the 1970s/early 1980s is a big topic just now, but a deep dive into the historical CPI data shows the world was very different then. The CPI peak in 1974 felt awful because food/clothing was 33 pct of the index and prices were up 8-12 pct. Those items are just 14 pct of CPI now. May 1980’s 13-14 pct CPI inflation was driven by high mortgage rates, no longer even used in CPI. Bottom line: look forward, not backwards, and consider energy stocks, gold, “B”, and even US stocks as inflation hedges.

During today's CoinDesk Consensus 2021 Conference, Ray Dalio said that not only would he rather own bitcoin than bonds - and for the world's largest risk parity hedge fund which traditionally hedges its equity exposure using a balanced 60/40 bond/stock split that's saying a lot - but putting all doubt to rest, he said that "I have some bitcoin."

Back in December, vol-specialist hedge fund One River Asset Management surprised its peers when long before Elon Musk arrived on  the scene, it became one of the first major asset managers to disclose it had purchased $600 million in bitcoin and ethereum and said it would own more than $1 billion in cryptos in early 2021. It wasn't along in this pioneering effort: Brevan Howard Asset Management co-founder Alan Howard had taken an ownership stake in One River Digital and was helping provide the company with backend trading services. Another prominent backer was British hedge fund Ruffer, which last December also revealed that 2.5% of its total AUM were in bitcoin.

What followed was a thorough critique from Rosenberg, who just a couple of months ago was warning that rising Treasury yields would soon push the market to a "breaking point," of what he sees as flaws in the market's pricing of lasting inflationary pressures.

They always do. European and Asian countries lost more citizens than they had since WWII. The US lost more than in any war. Children fell behind. Economic costs spiraled, leaving each nation’s finances forever changed. Monetary and fiscal policy merged in the West. Inflation reappeared. Despots tightened their grip.

Apples-to-apples, consumer price inflation nowadays is running close to the high inflation readings of the late 1970s. That should be a red flag for policymakers as monetary decisions are focused on actual outcomes, not forecasted. But reported inflation statistics do not show the 1970s inflation-style inflation because they no longer include actual house prices.

There’s a wide range of views out there at the moment, with the noisiness of the data giving everyone something to hang their hat on. In short, it’s the perfect time to step back and debate the longer-term outlook.

Earlier this month, just hours after Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) dragged Anthony Fauci over pandemic misinformation - and the fact that Fauci's NIH funded risky collaborations at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - the nation's top virologist (and highest-paid government employee) furiously backpedaled over the origins of the pandemic in what we can only assume was an effort to redirect attention from his own culpability.







Recall that since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, Fauci parroted CCP talking points - insisting that the virus couldn't possibly have come from a Chinese lab.

Authored by Tom Luongo via Gold, Goats, 'n Guns blog,


Last week both Martin Armstrong and Alistair MacLeod wrote about the changes to the Basel III rules and how they will greatly affect the physical and paper gold markets if implemented in their current form.


MacLeod’s article from last week is an excellent primer on the definitions and inner workings of the rules, the gold market and the changes to the rules.  The short redux is that the advantage to using unallocated accounts, savings accounts which are linked to gold by holding futures contracts, will end.


We’ve discussed parts of this in the past.  The process of creating fake supply to control the price of gold is on the line with these rule changes.

A prominent crypto analytics firm has issued a new report suggesting the Islamic Republic was able to successfully weather the Trump-era sanctions storm of the past few years by generating up to a billion dollars a year through mining cryptocurrencies. 


Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic concluded that a whopping 4.5% of all global bitcoin mining takes place in Iran alone. The Iranian government itself has acknowledged these attempts to beat the near total economic embargo on the country, which has been in effect and progressively ramped up since Trump pulled out of the Obama-era JCPOA nuclear deal in May 2018.

The cost of living numbers prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are highly misleading. Currently, the government understates inflation by using a formula based on the concept of a “constant level of satisfaction” that evolved during the first half of the 20th century in academia. This extended into the BLS re-weightings sales outlets such as discount or mass merchandisers with Main Street shops. Those promoting this change claimed it was simply another way to measure inflation and it still reflected the true cost of living.

It appears that Iran may be applying some last-minute leverage just ahead of the final round of nuclear talks in Vienna, and at a moment it's being widely reported that the main parties, including the US, are on the cusp of agreeing on a deal as final documents are being drafted. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Sunday announced that IAEA inspectors will no longer have access to surveillance images of the country's nuclear sites. 


"From May 22 and with the end of the three-month agreement, the agency will have no access to data collected by cameras inside the nuclear facilities agreed under the agreement," Qalibaf said as announced in state television.

It's never just one thing. This week Elon Musk, China, and pipeline cyber attackers all contributed to another crash, but, as Decrypt's Jeff John Roberts details below, there's cause for optimism.


It began with Elon Musk bashing Bitcoin, and ended with a renewed crypto crackdown in China. Those came as book-ends to a spate of other bad news in cryptoland, including a stomach-churning market crash and anger over Bitcoin's role in facilitating a massive cyber attack on an east coast oil pipeline. All of this saw Bitcoin limp into the weekend well below the $40,000 mark as the entire crypto industry licked its wounds.

Transitory or not transitory, that is the question.


The challenges from cracking supply-chains and the resulting strain on production and inventory are being felt widely. If you are looking to furnish a home, you have probably dealt with major delays in the delivery of your new sofa and may instead be sitting on beanbags. If you are looking to buy a car, you might be walking out with the sticker price and the wrong color. And good luck if you are trying to rent a car: if only Hertz had waited a year to file for bankruptcy it would be worth tens of billions today.

“Well, that follow-through failed to occur.Not only did the “buy signal” not trigger, but the market also broke down through the previous consolidation range. As I said, it did not work out as planned. The last exposure we took on is now pressuring the portfolio momentarily, but we should benefit from the turn if we are correct.”

New policies will artificially deflate “breakthrough infections” in the vaccinated, while the old rules continue to inflate case numbers in the unvaccinated.







The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) is altering its practices of data logging and testing for “Covid19” in order to make it seem the experimental gene-therapy “vaccines” are effective at preventing the alleged disease.
