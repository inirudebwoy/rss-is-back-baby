Japanese newswire Kyodo just confirmed that Japan plans to extend its state of emergency which covers Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures. The third state of emergency has been in place since April 25 and had been set to expire on May 11, but officials are concerned that the brief shutdown hasn't been sufficient to suppress infections, especially as cases start to accelerate across Asia.

As it's now May, it's worth examining the “sell in May and go away” adage.


Today’s Chart of the Day looks at the average daily path of the S&P 500 using data back to 1928. It shows that using 93 years of data, the “average” year does see its first notable correction in mid-May with the index only surpassing these levels again by early July.

We've all known that nationalizing student loan debt would turn out to be a terrible decision (just as it is when the government nationalizes any industry). We have been saying it on this site for years: it skews the market, offers capital to people who don't have the means to pay it back and allows universities to price gouge, leading to a lower quality of education.

As Bill and Melinda Gates divorce shocks corporate America, even capturing the attention of main street given their status as a preeminent global power couple, many observers have been looking for parallels between the Gates split and the "de-coupling" of Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos.

Authored by Burak Bekdil via The Gatestone Institute,


His critics often joke that when President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan pledges democratic reforms, one should run away immediately. His latest charm offensive in November, aimed at repairing Turkey's badly-strained ties with the West and Western institutions, has proven that the joke still holds value.

Authored by 'FreeSpeechFan' via TheDuran.com,


It is comforting that the Fourth turning is part of a natural cycle but also very disturbing that it is a period of crisis. As we know from previous cycles, many people suffer and die during a fourth turning.  However, I think we all know that a crisis is upon us as the corruption, collusion, scheming, propaganda, and self interest reaches its peak.

For nearly a century, gold had been pegged at roughly $20.67/oz. Then in 1934, FDR banned private holdings, confiscated people’s gold, and set the value at $35/oz for use in international trade/settlement. It remained anchored at that price for decades.
