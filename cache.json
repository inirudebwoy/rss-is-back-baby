We can't ascertain the number for now.\"\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boat was reportedly overloaded when it suddenly snapped into two in the middle of the Niger River. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nReports of how many people on board vary from news agency to news agency—some say between 160 and 200.\n\r\n\r\nAuthorities in Kebbi State told the BBC that first responders had been dispatched to the scene to search for survivors. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A rescue operation is underway, but only 22 survivors and one dead body have been recovered,\" a local official reportedly said.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQasimu Umar Wara, a resident of Wara town, told Reuters the passengers were returning from a newly-discovered gold vein in Niger. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They usually go there in the evenings and return to Wara in the morning,\" he said. \"Most of them are petty traders, food vendors and the local miners.\"\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wooden boat is reportedly rated for 80 passengers, and the accident is likely due to overloading. \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nWed, 05/26/2021 - 18:00",
