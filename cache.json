In the first 48 hours of release, the company received 44,500 pre-orders, according to CEO Jim Farley. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nNow, the pre-order count has reached 100,000 and continues to climb, according to Engadget. The F-Series line is America's best-selling truck for more than four decades. Millions of loyal Ford customers would never buy a Chevy, nevertheless, a Tesa or some other startup with a limited track record. \n\r\n\r\nBy comparison, since 2019, Tesla's Cybertruck has accumulated over 1 million Cybertruck reservations. Ford has a much larger following than Tesla and could surpass reservations. \n\r\n\r\nBesides Ford's loyal customer base, spanning generations, President Sleepy Joe gave the car company free press last month when he was seen driving around in the vehicle on a closed course. \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\"This sucker is quick,\" Biden said at the press conference. \n\r\n\r\nReservations require a $100 refundable deposit. Ford has said the F-150 Lightning deliveries should begin in the spring of 2022. The Cybertruck is expected to be released in late 2022 but really, who knows. \n\r\n\r\nThose who made reservations for the Ford electric truck will only have to wait about 10-12 months until delivery. Meanwhile, those who made Cybertruck reservations have been waiting for a couple of years. \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nThu, 06/10/2021 - 20:10",

The risks of another heat wave are increasing for next week. \n\r\n\r\nThe hottest and most fire-prone months are nearing as a second heat wave of the season could arrive as early as next week. \n\r\n\r\nHow the season turns out may depend on the immediate climate in the state.

In many parts of the state, temperature anomalies, the difference from an average, or baseline, temperature, could be +14 degrees. Forecasts suggest Bakersfield and Fresno could reach triple digits. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nProspects of the next heat wave come as the Drought Monitor (dated June 3) shows much of California, nevertheless, the West Coast, is experiencing some level of drought. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia could be headed for a dangerous wildfire season with conditions already parched. \n\r\n\r\nFurther, we want to monitor power prices in the state as grid demand could overwhelm supply, and power companies could issue rolling blackouts to conserve power or prevent wildfires. \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nThu, 06/10/2021 - 13:50",

Since the weekend, a heat wave blanketed the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast but will subside by midweek. \n\r\n\r\nGary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy, said energy demands are way \"above normal\" for this time of year because of increasing air-conditioning use. New England's grid operator could reach its summer peak in June instead of August, typically the hottest part of summer.\n\r\n\r\nMonday's highs were 90-95 degrees in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area to New York City to Boston. \n\r\n\r\nGrid operator PJM Interconnection LLC, a regional transmission organization serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, issued a hot weather alert Monday. PJM requested owners of transmission lines and power plants to delay maintenance. \n\r\n\r\nOn-peak electricity prices for Bloomingdale, Massachusetts, energy prices per megawatt-hour spiked on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nPeak energy prices for New York City also spiked. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe heat wave is expected to dissipate by mid-week as Mid-Atlantic and Northeast temperatures will be around average or slightly below normal as a cold front rolls in through the weekend. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nTue, 06/08/2021 - 19:45",

Paul Knight, assistant portfolio manager of U.S. large-cap equity at the Employees Retirement System of Texas for his observation). Indeed, the correlation between the spreads and the dollar in the past year is running at 0.57, reflecting its influence on the currency. Taken together with 10-year differentials , the two points of the curve delineate the trajectory of the dollar by more than four-fifths.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nTo be sure, it wasn’t always like this. Take a look at this chart above that encompasses a longer time frame, which shows the Dollar Index ignoring the movement in spreads. That was a time clearly before the pandemic when the U.S. economy was still in the midst of its longest post-war expansion, with central banks not anywhere near controlling the yield curve, de facto or de jure.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nMon, 06/07/2021 - 19:40",

The mission is to fly Ingenuity 350 feet south from its current location on the floor of Jezero Crater. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This will mark the second time the helicopter will land at an airfield that it did not survey from the air during a previous flight,\" NASA wrote. \"Instead, the Ingenuity team is relying on imagery collected by the HiRISE camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that suggests this new base of operations is relatively flat and has few surface obstructions.\"\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 22, Ingenuity flew its sixth mission that did not go so well. The solar-powered helicopter experienced glitches that interrupted internal systems. There was no mention of what caused the glitches; the craft was able to land safely. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nIngenuity has marvelously performed five flights and beamed incredible images from Mars back to Earth. \n\r\n\r\nNASA also has the Perseverance rover conducting land-based missions in the search for life. \n\r\n\r\nIn the last couple of months, the Red Planet has become a hotspot for the US and China, with China landing a rover of its own on the planet.\n\r\n\r\nSudden interest in Mars between both countries is because the planet allegedly has an abundance of rare metals that will power tomorrow's economy. \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSun, 06/06/2021 - 16:30",

The below chart shows the % of the US yield curve trading below inflation. We highlight in green the periods when more than 50% of the yield curve is trading below inflation (as is the case today).\n\r\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Macrobond and Variant Perception\n\r\n\r\nTypically, negative real yields are very stimulative for equities.  It is only when most of the yield curve is trading above inflation (white bars in right chart above) that equity markets start to face persistent headwinds.\n\r\n\r\nEquity investors do need to worry about rising yields in terms of sector rotation.  Duration is a basic concept for fixed income investors, but for equity investors, it is a less common method to look at portfolio exposures.\n\r\n\r\nWe have built a duration calculator for equities, using a combination of a 15-year DCF (consensus earnings forecasts, 2% terminal growth rate, individual cost of equity) and a terminal value duration component. This allows us to see which equities are most sensitive to a move in yields.\n\r\n\r\nFor the stocks in the Russell 1000, we calculate the duration of each name and aggregate to find the duration for different sectors. Financials, energy and consumer staples look like relative safe-havens. Info tech, healthcare and consumer discretionaries have the highest durations and are more vulnerable to yield moves. \n\r\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Macrobond and Variant Perception\n\r\n\r\n \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSun, 06/06/2021 - 15:10",

The price beat the previous record of HK$7.6 million for a spot in an office tower set back in 2019, before Hong Kong's protest movement triggered a crackdown by Beijing that has engulfed the territory's future in uncertainty, especially since China can simply snatch anyone - foreign nationals or otherwise - from Hong Kong's jurisdiction.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nMount Nicholson has a reputation for being one of the most iconic upscale projects in Hong Kong. At one point, an apartment in the project was the most expensive in Asia before the title was taken by CK Asset Holdings Ltd.’s 21 Borrett Road in February.\n\r\n\r\nAs that record-breaking sale might suggest, the parking spot record isn't a total surprise. HK has been seeing a comeback in the luxury home market in recent months, seeing record-breaking transactions as buyer's confidence returns. A house on Hong Kong's famous Peak (a luxury residential area overlooking the rest of the city) just rented for HK$1.6 a month in May.\n\r\n\r\nStill, despite its recent sharp rebound, Hong Kong's economy \"isn't out of the woods just yet,\" according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau. HK's economy grew 7.9% in the first quarter of 2021 vs. a year ago, marking the first economic expansion after six consecutive quarters of contraction. Yau appeared on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" Thursday morning to discuss it.\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nWhile retail sales have seen a strong rebound, tourism remains weak, and the expansion is on uneven footing, Yau said.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSat, 06/05/2021 - 17:00",

The crude was labeled as Malaysian bitumen blend to avoid sanction action from the United States.\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Vortexa, the average daily rate of Venezuelan oil imports into China over the past year was some 324,000 barrels, which represented about two-thirds of Venezuela's total exports of crude during the period.\n\r\n\r\nHowever, things are about to change as China plans to introduce a tax on bitumen blend imports later this month. This will increase prices by 40 to 50 percent, and the flow of Venezuelan oil may well thin considerably.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"While not all of the 350,000 to 400,000 bpd of the additional bitumen flowing into China will disappear overnight, a large proportion of it will be at risk,\" an Energy Aspects analyst told Reuters.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S. sanctions have reduced Venezuelan oil output to some half a million barrels daily over the two years since they were introduced.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nEven though the Biden administration has extended a sanction waiver for several U.S. oil companies, including Chevron and Halliburton, PDVSA is struggling to maintain production.\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, the state-owned oil major calculated it would need investments of $58 billion to boost production to where it was before Hugo Chavez rose to power in the late 90s. In 1998, Venezuela was pumping 2.3 million barrels of crude daily. The company said it planned to seek investments from both local and foreign companies to that end.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nFri, 06/04/2021 - 15:14",

NYC employees included thermostat repairmen making up to $198,630; regular laborers hauling away $213,169; electricians taking home $253,132; and plumbers pocketing up to $286,245.\n\r\n\r\nThe cost of benefits would be additional and is not included in these figures.\n\r\n\r\nThese large paychecks are only sustainable because Congress bailed out New York City for $4.3 billion in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The federal bailout more than covered the overstated deficits of the city.\n\r\n\r\nCity officials estimated a $5.5 billion gap, but actual revenues came in $2.7 billion higher. Using $1.2 billion from reserves, and finding $1 billion in unspecified labor savings, among other things closed the budget gap.\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, the federal money now exists for extra spending.\n\r\n\r\nIn December, Fitch Ratings downgraded New York City’s bond rating and issued a negative outlook.

          "description": "SEC Blasted Tesla In May 2020 For Failing To Oversee Musk's Tweets\r\n\r\n            \nIn previously undisclosed documents, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, securities regulators told Tesla last year that CEO Elon Musk's use of Twitter had twice violated a court-ordered policy requiring his tweets to be preapproved by company lawyers.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nIn letters sent to Tesla in 2019 and 2020, the SEC reportedly said tweets that Musk wrote about Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price hadn't undergone the required preapproval by Tesla's lawyers.\n\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, Musk had publicly mocked the SEC even after settling the previous fraud claims with the agency.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically, The Wall Street Journal reports that the SEC told Tesla in May 2020 that:\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe company had failed “to enforce these procedures and controls despite repeated violations by Mr. Musk.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter, signed by a senior SEC official in its San Francisco office, added:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Tesla has abdicated the duties required of it by the court’s order.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis perhaps explains why Musk himself was quick to admit in May 2020 that \"no\", his twitter remarks were not vetted.\n\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that we are just discovering these details now - at least 13 months after they occurred - as far as we can see, nothing at all has been done to either re-enforce the SEC-ordered oversight by Tesla lawyers, or to slow Musk's roll in tweeting frequency and absurdity (cough Dogecoin cough)...\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the SEC going to - wait for it - tell Tesla to preclear Musk's tweets (again)?\n\r\n— zerohedge (@zerohedge) February 25, 2021\n\r\n\n...we can only imagine how long it will be before some actual actions are taken... or enforcements hardened over the carmaker's incessant need to 'share'.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nTue, 06/01/2021 - 17:47",

Gen. Heather Pringle, quoted by Breaking Defense, said the critical design review of Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research Project (SSPIDR) would be conducted this summer. \n\r\n\r\nSSPIDR aims to use an Arachne satellite that would convert energy generated from the sun to radio frequency and beam it down to a land-based antenna. Once the radio frequency hits the antenna, it will be converted to useable power. \n\r\n\r\nIf SSPIDR is successful, it could one day give the US military a great advantage on the modern battlefield and an unlimited source of energy for forward operating bases. This will also allow for bases to power future weapons, such as lasers and rail guns. \n\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the military requires massive supply chains and convoys to receive not just energy power generation equipment but also fuel to power generators at remote bases. \n\r\n\r\n\"Ensuring that a forward operating base maintains reliable power is one of the most dangerous parts of military ground operations. Convoys and supply lines are a major target for adversaries,\" the narrator of a new AFRL video said. \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nWell, this appears to be one way the military is attempting to \"go green.\" \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSun, 05/30/2021 - 11:30",

          "description": "China Successfully Launches Cargo Rocket With Supplies For New Space Station\r\n\r\n            \nChina launched an automated cargo rocket hauling supplies for the country's new space station late Saturday from the tropical island of Hainan in the South China Sea. \n\r\n\r\nA Long March-7 Y3 rocket carrying the Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft blasted off at 8:55 pm local time from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, state-run media Global Times reported. \n\r\n\r\n\r\nChina launched the cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-2 on Saturday, which is scheduled to dock with the space station core module Tianhe to deliver supplies, equipment and propellant. #GLOBALink pic.twitter.com/GElRRa7NZd\n\r\n— China Xinhua News (@XHNews) May 29, 2021\n\r\n\nThe Tianzhou spacecraft is tasked with refueling the Tianhe space station core cabin for maintenance in orbit and also provides living necessities for future crewed missions at the space station. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese space agency expects 11 launches through the end of this year to deliver two more modules for the Tiangong Space Station, additional supplies, and a three-member crew. Today's launch marks the second within a month. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nApart from launch and eventual docking at the new space station, the rocket itself is set to fall back to Earth in an uncontrolled manner. Well, that's at least what happened earlier this month after the launch. There was no statement from Beijing about reentry plans for the rocket. \n\r\n\r\nBeijing isn't part of the International Space Station (ISS), primarily due to the U.S. The ISS has been in low Earth orbit for a little more than 22 years and could reach its lifespan by the end of this decade. Russia has already announced it would be withdrawing from the ISS to build its own. \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSat, 05/29/2021 - 17:00",
