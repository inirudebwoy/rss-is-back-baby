          "description": "The Tyranny Of The Minority Is Just As Dangerous As The Tyranny Of The Majority\r\n\r\n            \nAuthored by Michael Rectenwald via The Mises Institute,\n\r\n\r\nIn a previous installment, I pointed out that in On Liberty, John Stuart Mill advocated for minority opinion to be specially “encouraged and countenanced,” and thus that Mill was not an absolute free market thinker where opinion is concerned. Mill suggested that minority opinion should not only be tolerated but requires special encouragement in order to gain a fair hearing. Such special encouragement would amount to the subsidization of opinion, most likely by the state. Thus, Mill did not argue for a free and fair “marketplace of ideas.”\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nIt should be noted here that “the marketplace of ideas” is not only an analogy, where co…",

Readers may recall this was one of the weather disturbances we kept a close eye on earlier in the week. \n\r\n\r\n\"It is too soon to determine what, if any, impacts could occur there next week given the uncertainty in the long-range forecast,\" the NHC said. \n\r\n\r\nElsa is about 680 miles east of the Windward Islands as of 1100 ET. Tropical storm warnings have been posted for Barbados, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the Grenadines. Watches are in effect for Guadeloupe. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe storm is moving westward at 28 mph with sustained winds of about 45 mph.\n\r\n\r\nBy the weekend, the storm is expected to move across Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Cuba. There's a possibility it may shift direction northwestward into the Gulf of Mexico with a trajectory that could impact South Florida on Monday and or Tuesday.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nA lot of uncertainty surrounds Elsa's path late weekend into next week.

The decision also delivers a blow to the FTC and the states, which claimed Facebook violated antitrust laws by buying photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp in order to cut off emerging competitive threats and protect its monopoly.\n\r\n\r\nBoasberg’s decision to toss the Facebook complaints shows the hurdles U.S. antitrust enforcers face in trying to take on the internet giants. Officials on their own can’t break up companies or impose other remedies, but instead must persuade judges to take action. The process can take years.\n\r\n\r\nFacebook stock surged more than 3% on the news, sending the stock to a new all time high...\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n... and pushing the company's market cap above $1 trillion for the first time ever, where FB joins the other quatro comas FAAMG club members.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe full opinion is below (pdf link).\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\ngov.uscourts.dcd.224921.73.0 by Zerohedge\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nMon, 06/28/2021 - 15:15",

Already, power prices are creeping higher early Sunday morning, and one would expect prices to increase over the coming days during peak hours. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, an unprecedented heat wave is striking the Northwest where temperatures are 10 to 20 degrees above average - many homes in those states don't have air condition. \n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the western half of the US has been experiencing a megadrought producing fallow lands that may spark a grasshopper plague which would decimate crops. \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSun, 06/27/2021 - 13:30",

This is a much lower figure than the 66-bcf build analysts forecasted on Reuters polls. The primary reason for the low storage build among utilities is that power generators burned a tremendous amount of gas to keep Americans air conditioners on as a heat wave and megadrought transformed the western half of the U.S. into a furnace. \n\r\n\r\nLast week, U.S. liquefied natural gas exports fell 9.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) primarily due to short-term maintenance outages at Gulf Coast ports. However, exports have been soaring in the last couple of months, with averages of 10.8 bcfd in May and a record 11.5 bcfd in April. \n\r\n\r\nData provider Refinitiv projected gas demand, including exports would increase from 88.2 bcfd this week to 93.1 bcfd next week\n\r\n\r\nTurning to our note on Jan. 13, titled \"Goldman Flips On NatGas, Warns Of Bullish \"Perfect Storm,\"\" it seems as Goldman Sachs' Samantha Dart was right about \"significant upside to NYMEX gas prices this summer\" as prices hit 29-month highs. \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nThu, 06/24/2021 - 19:45",

Go to India if you want, or somewhere to America. But for as long as you are here and you are a human being and can carry the virus, you should get vaccinated.\"\n\r\n\r\nDuterte demanded the government identify those who refuse to get vaccinated. \"I will order their arrest, to be honest,\" he said.\n\r\n\r\nDuterte's straightforward comments come as low turnout at several vaccination locations across Manila was observed on Monday. \n\r\n\r\nAs of Sunday, the Philippines had 2.1 million people fully vaccinated - with ambitious goals of immunizing 70 million people by the end of the year, in a country of about 110 million. \n\r\n\r\nBesides jail, Duterte could take a softer approach and follow the route the US government took to increase vaccinations by offering lottery tickets, monetary prizes, trucks, guns, food, and all sorts of other goodies to entice people to get vaccinated. \n\r\n\r\nHowever, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra countered Duterte's remarks and said in a statement there's no law forcing citizens to get vaccinated. \n\r\n\r\nLater this month, the Philippines is expecting donated shots from the US to arrive. \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nTue, 06/22/2021 - 17:45",

          "description": "Top Quant Strategy Just Suffered Its Biggest Ever Monthly Loss\r\n\r\n            \nWith all the drama and focus on  the inflation story, especially after last week's transitory hawkish pivot by the Fed, SocGen's Andrew Lapthorne points out that there have been some even more dramatic moves in factor performance in recent weeks.\n\r\n\r\nTake long/short Value-Momentum, arguably one of, if not the, most popular quant strategies, which had been in the ascendancy this year as both Value and Price Momentum factors converged around the cyclical recovery/inflation theme. But in recent weeks, and especially after last week's FOMC, the strategy suffered a historic reversal, posting its worst monthly decline since 2002 according to Lapthorne's calculations, with the 4.3% loss on Thursday ranking as the 14th worst day for our Value-Momentum factor since 1990.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nAnd, as the next chart show, on a monthly basis, the monthly drawdown in long/short Value-Momentum has been the biggest on record.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nOther quant factors have done better: earnings momentum (bottom-up upgrades and downgrades) remains strong, with 62% of all global estimate changes for 2021 coming through as upgrades and with a high percentage of those upgrades coming through in the reflation sectors (Industrials, Basic Materials, Financial and Energy).\n\r\n\r\nSo, while markets have cooled on the reflation theme in recent weeks, the profit momentum story is still aligned, and while the copper price has retracted back to mid-April levels, the oil price is now above pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, Lapthorne concludes, the rate of increase is slowing (it had to at some stage), base effects from last year’s slump will be behind us, and we are entering a period when company reporting is typically quieter. So macro noise looks set to dominate for some time.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nTue, 06/22/2021 - 13:45",

Starting today, Monday, June 21, Prime members will have 48 hours to scour \"more than 2 million deals\" in order to save some money while spending it.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nOriginally conceived in 2015 to celebrate Amazon's 20th anniversary, Statista's Felix Richter notes that Prime Day has quickly evolved into a major shopping event, rivaling Black Friday and Cyber Monday. For Amazon, it has become a great vehicle to boost sales in the slower summer months, explaining why the event has been extended from 24 hours in 2015 and 2016, to 30 hours in 2017, 36 hours in 2018 and finally 48 hours since 2019.\n\r\n\r\nAs the following chart, based on estimates from Digital Commerce 360, shows, Prime Day sales have grown significantly over the years. In 2020, total merchandise volume, including first and third-party sales passed the $10 billion milestone for the first time, and there's little reason to doubt that 2021 will mark another record in terms of Prime Day sales. After all, the number of Prime members worldwide has grown from 150 million in January 2020 to more than 200 million in April 2021.\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nYou will find more infographics at Statista\n\r\n\r\nAmazon Prime Day deals are only available to members, creating an incentive for consumers to sign up for the program or stay onboard.

The description in the listing calls the house a \"slice of hell\" after a departing tenant went ape shit during an eviction.\n\r\n\r\n\"Now it's every landlord's nightmare and needs someone with firm resolve to appreciate its potential. If you dream of owning your own little slice of hell and turning it into a piece of heaven, then look no further!\" the listing said. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nPhotos uploaded to Redfin for the property located at 4525 Churchill Ct, Colorado Springs, show widespread vandalism with spray-painted floors, walls, doors, and cabinets, along with hammer holes in the drywall. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\"There is not one surface of the home that has not been enhanced with black spray paint or a swinging hammer - damage done by an angry departing tenant who didn't want to pay rent. But don't let that slow you down. It's not nearly as daunting as the freezer in the basement that's full of meat and hasn't had electricity to it for over a year,\" the listing continued. \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nThe listing even warns prospective buyers to \"wear your mask\" before entering the home. \n\r\n\r\nAt $590,000, the list price is about a 16% discount of what it could sell for if the house was in tip-top shape. \n\r\n\r\nAccording to The Denver Post, the price tag to fix the damages ranges between $150,000 to $230,000. This is the perfect fixer-upper for someone trying to buy a suburban house during one of the worst housing shortages. \n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, millions of Americans face an eviction crisis in the coming months as pandemic safety nets expire. \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSat, 06/19/2021 - 20:00",

A genuine wonder drug in other realms, ivermectin has all but eliminated parasitic diseases like river blindness and elephantiasis, helping discoverer Satoshi Ōmura win the Nobel Prize in 2015. As far as its uses in the pandemic went, however, research was still scant. Could it really be a magic Covid-19 bullet?\n\r\n\r\nKory had been trying to make such a case, but complained to the Senate that public efforts had been stifled, because “every time we mention ivermectin, we get put in Facebook jail.” A Catch-22 seemed to be ensnaring science. With the world desperate for news about an unprecedented disaster, Silicon Valley had essentially decided to disallow discussion of a potential solution — disallow calls for more research and more study — because not enough research and study had been done. Once, people weren’t allowed to take drugs before they got FDA approval.

It's one small step toward widespread adoption, as autonomous vehicles aren't currently legal in the province. \n\r\n\r\nThe proposed regulation will be sent for approval by the Standing Committee of Shenzhen People’s Congress at the end of June.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nXiao Jianxiong, founder of Shenzhen-based self-driving company Autox Technologies Inc., says the highlight of the regulation is the issuance of special license plates. \n\r\n\r\nIf the regulation passes, the \"Shenzhen government will issue a list of ICVs that can be sold, driven on roads and used for transportation business,\" the report says.\n\r\n\r\nThere's currently no national standards on self driving vehicles in China. Since Shenzhen is a special economic zone, it has more leeway to legislate than most other provinces in China. This would make it an obvious starting point for regulations that may wind up eventually spreading across the country - not unlike how California can often lead nationwide regulation in the U.S.\n\r\n\r\nXiao says that the number of self driving cabs could reach 50,000 by 2023 in China.

This has resulted in significant port congestion. The world's largest container line, Maersk, warned last week congestion at Yantian is worse than the shutdown of the Suez Canal in March.\n\r\n\r\nData from flight tracker VariFlight shows 400 inbound and outbound flights were canceled Friday. More are expected Saturday. \n\r\n\r\nChen Bin, deputy director of Guangzhou's health commission, said there was still an elevated threat of a community outbreak. He warned against an easing of lockdown measures and said residents in locked-down areas would be tested regularly to prevent a spread. \n\r\n\r\nSo if you were hoping the logistical nightmare in China would be over in the intermediate timeframe, think again. \n\r\n\r\nMore than 60,000 factories are situated in Guangdong, and about a third of China's exports and one-third of the world's production of shoes, textiles, and toys move through airports and seaports in the region.\n\r\n\r\n \n\r\n\r\n \n\r\n\r\n \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSat, 06/19/2021 - 11:00",

The SNFA usually consisted of a rotating force of about six to 10 ships from NATO countries that would sail around the region.\n\r\n\r\nIf the US established such a naval force for the Pacific, it would likely include Washington’s European allies and regional ones such as Japan and Australia.\n\r\n\r\nThe idea grew from a 100-day task force review of the Pentagon’s China policy that was led by Ely Ratner, a special advisor to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.\n\r\n\r\nRatner is a China hawk who came from the interventionist Center for a New American Security think tank. He was appointed to his position to appease China hawks who did not believe Austin had enough experience dealing with Asia.\n\r\n\r\nLast week, Austin ordered the Pentagon to adopt initiatives recommended by the China task force review. Most of the recommendations are being kept classified, but Austin’s directive ordered the military to start acting like China is the top \"threat\" facing the US instead of just talking about it.\n\r\n\r\nA US official told Defense One that the task force found a \"say-do-gap\" between what the Pentagon is saying about China and the action it is taking.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nThu, 06/17/2021 - 20:00",

However, he makes several errors in his analysis of Bitcoin. \n\r\n\r\nHe is wrong about its scarcity and its ability to hedge inflation, but his largest mistake is his guiding principle: that Bitcoin (unlike gold) has no fundamental value.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nFor example, Schiff is quick to point out that gold has uses…",

Second, the Ford F-150 Lightning now has 100,000 reservations in just the 3 short weeks since its introduction. \n\r\n\r\nEmma Bergg, Ford spokeswoman, told the Detroit Free Press on Thursday: \"We're super excited about the demand. Reservations are getting added all the time.\"\n\r\n\r\n \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Lightning was released 3 weeks ago and packs 563 horsepower and 775 lb.-ft. of torque. In the first 48 hours after its release, the company received 44,500 pre-orders. President Biden was at the truck's release last month and even gave the Lightning a test drive and some free press. \"This sucker is quick,\" Biden said, after taking off in the truck on a closed course. \n\r\n\r\nBy comparison, since 2019, Tesla's Cybertruck has accumulated over 1 million reservations. \n\r\n\r\nTesla's official website doesn't denote an expected delivery date. As of May, it was expected that the Cybertruck would begin production in \"late 2021\". \n\r\n\r\nFord, meanwhile, is taking $100 refundable deposits for the Lightning and the truck starts at $39,974.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSat, 06/12/2021 - 17:00",

Estimates on the higher-end put China’s nuclear stockpile at 350 warheads. Russia has about 6,350 warheads, while the US has 5,800.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nDespite the numbers, the US complains that Beijing does not want to enter arms control talks. But China has no motivation to do so unless the US and Russia make an effort to reduce their arsenals. Regardless, the US continues to blame the issue on China.\n\r\n\r\n\"To date, China has rebuffed US efforts to initiate bilateral talks on risk reduction and strategic stability,\" Robert Wood, the US ambassador for disarmament, said at the conference.\n\r\n\r\nBesides having way more nuclear weapons than Beijing, the US is also encircling China with military hardware. The US has plans to deploy medium-range missiles near China that were previously banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the US withdrew from in 2019.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nWang took a shot at the US for its plans to further militarize Asia which he characterized as undermining regional stability.\n\r\n\r\n\"China opposes the development and deployment of regional and global missile defense systems by a certain country that undermine strategic stability, and China opposes the deployment of land-based intermediate-range ballistic missiles by the same country in the neighborhood of other countries,\" he said.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSat, 06/12/2021 - 13:30",

Meteorologists at BAMWX have published data on surface soil moisture over 20 years. Surface soil moisture is the water that is in the upper 4 inches and available for various types of plants. They found that the 2021 moisture deficit for early June is the worst it has ever been in two decades. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nBAMWX's Vince Bryan says the moisture deficit in the soil is \"a concern\" as it may impact plant development. Soil moisture plays a crucial role in agricultural monitoring, drought and flood forecasting, forest fire prediction, and water supply management. \n\r\n\r\nSoil moisture observations can alert of impending drought, such as what's been underway in the Western US this year. \n\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that soil moisture deficits can dry crops and make them more vulnerable to pests. Even short-term drought can cause damage to crops, mainly during critical stages of crop development, such as after planting or during flowering. \n\r\n\r\nIf the drought persists, crop yields could come underestimates this year and result in elevated agricultural prices. \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSat, 06/12/2021 - 09:55",

Instead of pulling over, she continued down the highway, moving over to the right lane and slowing down with her hazard lights on.\n\r\n\r\nWhile the woman claims she was looking for a safe place to pull over, the officer ran out of patience. In the video the Arkansas State Police trooper is seen using a PIT maneuver \"which caused Harper’s car to crash into the concrete median and flip,\" according to Fox 16. \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n“In my head I was going to lose the baby,” Harper told Fox 16.

In the first 48 hours of release, the company received 44,500 pre-orders, according to CEO Jim Farley. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nNow, the pre-order count has reached 100,000 and continues to climb, according to Engadget. The F-Series line is America's best-selling truck for more than four decades. Millions of loyal Ford customers would never buy a Chevy, nevertheless, a Tesa or some other startup with a limited track record. \n\r\n\r\nBy comparison, since 2019, Tesla's Cybertruck has accumulated over 1 million Cybertruck reservations. Ford has a much larger following than Tesla and could surpass reservations. \n\r\n\r\nBesides Ford's loyal customer base, spanning generations, President Sleepy Joe gave the car company free press last month when he was seen driving around in the vehicle on a closed course. \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\"This sucker is quick,\" Biden said at the press conference. \n\r\n\r\nReservations require a $100 refundable deposit. Ford has said the F-150 Lightning deliveries should begin in the spring of 2022. The Cybertruck is expected to be released in late 2022 but really, who knows. \n\r\n\r\nThose who made reservations for the Ford electric truck will only have to wait about 10-12 months until delivery.

The risks of another heat wave are increasing for next week. \n\r\n\r\nThe hottest and most fire-prone months are nearing as a second heat wave of the season could arrive as early as next week. \n\r\n\r\nHow the season turns out may depend on the immediate climate in the state. Extreme heat and drought are several factors that may produce dry fuels and eventually spark fires. \n\r\n\r\nForecast temperature anomalies daily are expected to jump for the southern part of the state by Tuesday/Wednesday and then the whole state by Friday. In many parts of the state, temperature anomalies, the difference from an average, or baseline, temperature, could be +14 degrees. Forecasts suggest Bakersfield and Fresno could reach triple digits. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nProspects of the next heat wave come as the Drought Monitor (dated June 3) shows much of California, nevertheless, the West Coast, is experiencing some level of drought. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia could be headed for a dangerous wildfire season with conditions already parched. \n\r\n\r\nFurther, we want to monitor power prices in the state as grid demand could overwhelm supply, and power companies could issue rolling blackouts to conserve power or prevent wildfires. \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nThu, 06/10/2021 - 13:50",

Since the weekend, a heat wave blanketed the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast but will subside by midweek. \n\r\n\r\nGary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy, said energy demands are way \"above normal\" for this time of year because of increasing air-conditioning use. New England's grid operator could reach its summer peak in June instead of August, typically the hottest part of summer.\n\r\n\r\nMonday's highs were 90-95 degrees in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area to New York City to Boston. \n\r\n\r\nGrid operator PJM Interconnection LLC, a regional transmission organization serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, issued a hot weather alert Monday. PJM requested owners of transmission lines and power plants to delay maintenance. \n\r\n\r\nOn-peak electricity prices for Bloomingdale, Massachusetts, energy prices per megawatt-hour spiked on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nPeak energy prices for New York City also spiked. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe heat wave is expected to dissipate by mid-week as Mid-Atlantic and Northeast temperatures will be around average or slightly below normal as a cold front rolls in through the weekend. \n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nTue, 06/08/2021 - 19:45",

Paul Knight, assistant portfolio manager of U.S. large-cap equity at the Employees Retirement System of Texas for his observation). Indeed, the correlation between the spreads and the dollar in the past year is running at 0.57, reflecting its influence on the currency. Taken together with 10-year differentials , the two points of the curve delineate the trajectory of the dollar by more than four-fifths.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nTo be sure, it wasn’t always like this.

The below chart shows the % of the US yield curve trading below inflation. We highlight in green the periods when more than 50% of the yield curve is trading below inflation (as is the case today).\n\r\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Macrobond and Variant Perception\n\r\n\r\nTypically, negative real yields are very stimulative for equities.  It is only when most of the yield curve is trading above inflation (white bars in right chart above) that equity markets start to face persistent headwinds.\n\r\n\r\nEquity investors do need to worry about rising yields in terms of sector rotation.  Duration is a basic concept for fixed income investors, but for equity investors, it is a less common method to look at portfolio exposures.\n\r\n\r\nWe have built a duration calculator for equities, using a combination of a 15-year DCF (consensus earnings forecasts, 2% terminal growth rate, individual cost of equity) and a terminal value duration component. This allows us to see which equities are most sensitive to a move in yields.\n\r\n\r\nFor the stocks in the Russell 1000, we calculate the duration of each name and aggregate to find the duration for different sectors. Financials, energy and consumer staples look like relative safe-havens. Info tech, healthcare and consumer discretionaries have the highest durations and are more vulnerable to yield moves. \n\r\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Macrobond and Variant Perception\n\r\n\r\n \n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSun, 06/06/2021 - 15:10",

Learned helplessness, employed as a control tool.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nLearned helplessness is well-documented. It takes place when an individual believes he continuously faces a negative, uncontrollable situation and stops trying to improve his circumstances, even when he has the ability to do so.

Psychologists call this a maladaptive response, characterized by avoidance of challenges and the collapse of problem-solving when obstacles arise.

The price beat the previous record of HK$7.6 million for a spot in an office tower set back in 2019, before Hong Kong's protest movement triggered a crackdown by Beijing that has engulfed the territory's future in uncertainty, especially since China can simply snatch anyone - foreign nationals or otherwise - from Hong Kong's jurisdiction.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nMount Nicholson has a reputation for being one of the most iconic upscale projects in Hong Kong. At one point, an apartment in the project was the most expensive in Asia before the title was taken by CK Asset Holdings Ltd.’s 21 Borrett Road in February.\n\r\n\r\nAs that record-breaking sale might suggest, the parking spot record isn't a total surprise. HK has been seeing a comeback in the luxury home market in recent months, seeing record-breaking transactions as buyer's confidence returns. A house on Hong Kong's famous Peak (a luxury residential area overlooking the rest of the city) just rented for HK$1.6 a month in May.\n\r\n\r\nStill, despite its recent sharp rebound, Hong Kong's economy \"isn't out of the woods just yet,\" according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau. HK's economy grew 7.9% in the first quarter of 2021 vs. a year ago, marking the first economic expansion after six consecutive quarters of contraction. Yau appeared on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" Thursday morning to discuss it.\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nWhile retail sales have seen a strong rebound, tourism remains weak, and the expansion is on uneven footing, Yau said.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSat, 06/05/2021 - 17:00",

The crude was labeled as Malaysian bitumen blend to avoid sanction action from the United States.\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Vortexa, the average daily rate of Venezuelan oil imports into China over the past year was some 324,000 barrels, which represented about two-thirds of Venezuela's total exports of crude during the period.\n\r\n\r\nHowever, things are about to change as China plans to introduce a tax on bitumen blend imports later this month. This will increase prices by 40 to 50 percent, and the flow of Venezuelan oil may well thin considerably.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"While not all of the 350,000 to 400,000 bpd of the additional bitumen flowing into China will disappear overnight, a large proportion of it will be at risk,\" an Energy Aspects analyst told Reuters.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S. sanctions have reduced Venezuelan oil output to some half a million barrels daily over the two years since they were introduced.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nEven though the Biden administration has extended a sanction waiver for several U.S. oil companies, including Chevron and Halliburton, PDVSA is struggling to maintain production.\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, the state-owned oil major calculated it would need investments of $58 billion to boost production to where it was before Hugo Chavez rose to power in the late 90s. In 1998, Venezuela was pumping 2.3 million barrels of crude daily. The company said it planned to seek investments from both local and foreign companies to that end.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nFri, 06/04/2021 - 15:14",

That is up sharply from 76,166 employees with pay exceeding $100,000 in 2016.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nData comes a year before the pandemic hit and is the latest year available.\n\r\n\r\nThese were not just high-level employees like agency commissioners or deputy mayors. NYC employees included thermostat repairmen making up to $198,630; regular laborers hauling away $213,169; electricians taking home $253,132; and plumbers pocketing up to $286,245.\n\r\n\r\nThe cost of benefits would be additional and is not included in these figures.\n\r\n\r\nThese large paychecks are only sustainable because Congress bailed out New York City for $4.3 billion in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The federal bailout more than covered the overstated deficits of the city.\n\r\n\r\nCity officials estimated a $5.5 billion gap, but actual revenues came in $2.7 billion higher. Using $1.2 billion from reserves, and finding $1 billion in unspecified labor savings, among other things closed the budget gap.\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, the federal money now exists for extra spending.\n\r\n\r\nIn December, Fitch Ratings downgraded New York City’s bond rating and issued a negative outlook.
