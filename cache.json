Go to India if you want, or somewhere to America. But for as long as you are here and you are a human being and can carry the virus, you should get vaccinated.\"\n\r\n\r\nDuterte demanded the government identify those who refuse to get vaccinated.¬†\"I will order their arrest, to be honest,\"¬†he said.\n\r\n\r\nDuterte's straightforward comments come as low turnout at several vaccination locations across Manila was observed on Monday.¬†\n\r\n\r\nAs of Sunday, the Philippines had 2.1 million people fully vaccinated - with ambitious goals of immunizing 70 million people by the end of the year, in a country of about 110 million.¬†\n\r\n\r\nBesides jail, Duterte could take a softer approach and follow the route the US government took to increase vaccinations by offering lottery tickets, monetary prizes, trucks, guns, food, and all sorts of other goodies to entice people to get vaccinated.¬†\n\r\n\r\nHowever, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra countered Duterte's remarks and said in a statement there's no law forcing citizens to get vaccinated.¬†\n\r\n\r\nLater this month, the Philippines is expecting donated shots from the US to arrive.¬†\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nTue, 06/22/2021 - 17:45",

But in recent weeks, and especially after last week's FOMC, the strategy suffered a historic reversal, posting its worst monthly decline since 2002 according to Lapthorne's calculations, with the 4.3% loss on Thursday ranking as the 14th worst day for our Value-Momentum factor since 1990.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nAnd, as the next chart show, on a monthly basis, the monthly drawdown in long/short Value-Momentum has been the biggest on record.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nOther quant factors have done better: earnings momentum (bottom-up upgrades and downgrades) remains strong, with 62% of all global estimate changes for 2021 coming through as upgrades and with a high percentage of those upgrades coming through in the reflation sectors (Industrials, Basic Materials, Financial and Energy).\n\r\n\r\nSo, while markets have cooled on the reflation theme in recent weeks, the profit momentum story is still aligned, and while the copper price has retracted back to mid-April levels, the oil price is now above pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, Lapthorne concludes, the rate of increase is slowing (it had to at some stage), base effects from last year‚Äôs slump will be behind us, and we are entering a period when company reporting is typically quieter. So macro noise looks set to dominate for some time.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nTue, 06/22/2021 - 13:45",

Starting today, Monday, June 21, Prime members will have 48 hours to scour \"more than 2 million deals\" in order to save some money while spending it.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nOriginally conceived in 2015 to celebrate Amazon's 20th anniversary, Statista's Felix Richter notes that Prime Day has quickly evolved into a major shopping event, rivaling Black Friday and Cyber Monday. For Amazon, it has become a great vehicle to boost sales in the slower summer months, explaining why the event has been extended from 24 hours in 2015 and 2016, to 30 hours in 2017, 36 hours in 2018 and finally 48 hours since 2019.\n\r\n\r\nAs the following chart, based on estimates from¬†Digital Commerce 360, shows, Prime Day sales have grown significantly over the years. In 2020, total merchandise volume, including first and third-party sales passed the $10 billion milestone for the first time, and there's little reason to doubt that 2021 will mark another record in terms of Prime Day sales. After all, the number of Prime members worldwide has grown from 150 million in January 2020 to more than 200 million in April 2021.\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nYou will find more infographics at Statista\n\r\n\r\nAmazon Prime Day deals are only available to members, creating an incentive for consumers to sign up for the program or stay onboard.

The SNFA usually consisted of a rotating force of about six to 10 ships from NATO countries that would sail around the region.\n\r\n\r\nIf the US established such a naval force for the Pacific, it would likely include Washington‚Äôs European allies and regional ones such as Japan and Australia.\n\r\n\r\nThe idea grew from a 100-day task force review of the Pentagon‚Äôs China policy that was led by Ely Ratner, a special advisor to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.\n\r\n\r\nRatner is a China hawk who came from¬†the interventionist Center for a New American Security think tank.¬†He was appointed to his position to appease China hawks who did not believe Austin had enough experience dealing with Asia.\n\r\n\r\nLast week, Austin¬†ordered the Pentagon to adopt initiatives recommended by the China task force review. Most of the recommendations are being kept classified, but Austin‚Äôs directive ordered the military to start acting like China is the top \"threat\" facing the US instead of just talking about it.\n\r\n\r\nA US official told¬†Defense One¬†that the task force found a \"say-do-gap\" between what the Pentagon is saying about China and the action it is taking.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nThu, 06/17/2021 - 20:00",

However, as Visual Capitalist's Dorothy Neufeld notes, other variables, such as a growing money supply and rising raw materials costs, could factor into rising inflation.\n\r\n\r\nTo show current price levels in context, this Markets in a Minute chart from¬†New York Life Investments¬†shows the history of inflation over 100 years.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nU.S. Inflation: Early History\n\r‚Ä¶",

We've documented¬†(read¬†here¬†&¬†here)¬†this spring of a \"megadrought\" sweeping across states like California and Nevada as risks of a second Dust Bowl increase by the day.¬†\n\r\n\r\nBut in this note, let's dive deeper into the drought and how it's impacting farmers and the potential consequences it could have on crops. Meteorologists at¬†BAMWX¬†have published data on surface soil moisture over 20 years. Surface soil moisture is the¬†water¬†that is in the upper 4 inches and available for various types of plants. They found that the 2021 moisture deficit for early June is the worst it has ever been in two decades.¬†\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nBAMWX's Vince Bryan says the moisture deficit in the soil is \"a concern\" as it may impact plant development. Soil moisture plays a crucial role in agricultural monitoring, drought and flood forecasting, forest fire prediction, and water supply management.¬†\n\r\n\r\nSoil moisture observations can alert of impending drought, such as what's been underway in the Western US this year.¬†\n\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that soil moisture deficits can dry crops and make them more vulnerable to pests. Even short-term¬†drought¬†can cause damage to¬†crops, mainly during critical stages of¬†crop¬†development, such as after planting or during flowering.¬†\n\r\n\r\nIf the drought persists, crop yields could come underestimates this year and result in elevated agricultural prices.¬†\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSat, 06/12/2021 - 09:55",

In the first 48 hours of release, the company¬†received¬†44,500 pre-orders, according to CEO Jim Farley.¬†\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nNow, the pre-order count has reached 100,000 and continues to climb, according to¬†Engadget. The F-Series line is America's best-selling truck for more than four decades. Millions of loyal Ford customers would never buy a Chevy, nevertheless, a Tesa or some other startup with a limited track record.¬†\n\r\n\r\nBy comparison, since 2019, Tesla's¬†Cybertruck¬†has accumulated over 1 million Cybertruck reservations. Ford has a much larger following than Tesla and could surpass reservations.¬†\n\r\n\r\nBesides Ford's loyal customer base, spanning generations, President Sleepy Joe gave the car company free press last month when he was seen driving around in the vehicle on a closed course.¬†\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\"This sucker is quick,\" Biden said at the press conference.¬†\n\r\n\r\nReservations require a $100 refundable deposit. Ford has said the F-150 Lightning deliveries should begin in the spring of 2022. The Cybertruck is expected to be released in late 2022 but really, who knows.¬†\n\r\n\r\nThose who made reservations for the Ford electric truck will only have to wait about 10-12 months until delivery. Meanwhile, those who made Cybertruck reservations have been waiting for a couple of years.¬†\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nThu, 06/10/2021 - 20:10",

Paul Knight, assistant portfolio manager of U.S. large-cap equity at the Employees Retirement System of Texas for his observation). Indeed, the correlation between the spreads and the dollar in the past year is running at 0.57, reflecting its influence on the currency. Taken together with 10-year differentials , the two points of the curve delineate the trajectory of the dollar by more than four-fifths.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nTo be sure, it wasn‚Äôt always like this. Take a look at this chart above that encompasses a longer time frame, which shows the Dollar Index ignoring the movement in spreads.

The below chart shows the % of the US yield curve trading below inflation. We highlight in green the periods when more than 50% of the yield curve is trading below inflation (as is the case today).\n\r\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Macrobond and Variant Perception\n\r\n\r\nTypically, negative real yields are very stimulative for equities.¬† It is only when most of the yield curve is trading above inflation (white bars in right chart above) that equity markets start to face persistent headwinds.\n\r\n\r\nEquity investors do need to worry about rising yields in terms of sector rotation.¬† Duration is a basic concept for fixed income investors, but for equity investors, it is a less common method to look at portfolio exposures.\n\r\n\r\nWe have built a duration calculator for equities, using a combination of a 15-year DCF (consensus earnings forecasts, 2% terminal growth rate, individual cost of equity) and a terminal value duration component. This allows us to see which equities are most sensitive to a move in yields.\n\r\n\r\nFor the stocks in the Russell 1000, we calculate the duration of each name and aggregate to find the duration for different sectors. Financials, energy and consumer staples look like relative safe-havens.

The price beat the previous record of HK$7.6 million for a spot in an office tower set back in 2019, before Hong Kong's protest movement triggered a crackdown by Beijing that has engulfed the territory's future in uncertainty, especially since China can simply snatch anyone - foreign nationals or otherwise - from Hong Kong's jurisdiction.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nMount Nicholson has a reputation for being one of the most iconic upscale projects in Hong Kong. At one point, an apartment in the project was the most expensive in Asia before the title was taken by CK Asset Holdings Ltd.‚Äôs 21 Borrett Road in February.\n\r\n\r\nAs that record-breaking sale might suggest, the parking spot record isn't a total surprise. HK has been seeing a comeback in the luxury home market in recent months, seeing record-breaking transactions as buyer's confidence returns. A house on Hong Kong's famous Peak (a luxury residential area overlooking the rest of the city) just rented for HK$1.6 a month in May.\n\r\n\r\nStill, despite its recent sharp rebound, Hong Kong's economy \"isn't out of the woods just yet,\" according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau. HK's economy grew 7.9% in the first quarter of 2021 vs. a year ago, marking the first economic expansion after six consecutive quarters of contraction. Yau appeared on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" Thursday morning to discuss it.\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nWhile retail sales have seen a strong rebound, tourism remains weak, and the expansion is on uneven footing, Yau said.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nSat, 06/05/2021 - 17:00",

The crude was labeled as Malaysian bitumen blend to avoid sanction action from the United States.\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Vortexa, the average daily rate of Venezuelan oil imports into China over the past year was some 324,000 barrels, which represented about two-thirds of Venezuela's total exports of crude during the period.\n\r\n\r\nHowever, things are about to change as China plans to introduce a tax on bitumen blend imports later this month. This will increase prices by 40 to 50 percent, and the flow of Venezuelan oil may well thin considerably.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"While not all of the 350,000 to 400,000 bpd of the additional bitumen flowing into China will disappear overnight, a large proportion of it will be at risk,\" an Energy Aspects analyst told Reuters.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S. sanctions have¬†reduced¬†Venezuelan oil output to some half a million barrels daily over the two years since they were introduced.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nEven though the Biden administration has extended a sanction waiver for several U.S. oil companies, including Chevron and Halliburton, PDVSA is struggling to maintain production.\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, the state-owned oil major calculated it would need investments of $58 billion to boost production to where it was before Hugo Chavez rose to power in the late 90s. In 1998, Venezuela was¬†pumping¬†2.3 million barrels of crude daily. The company said it planned to seek investments from both local and foreign companies to that end.\n\r\n\r\n      Tyler Durden\r\nFri, 06/04/2021 - 15:14",

The federal bailout more than covered the overstated deficits of the city.\n\r\n\r\nCity officials estimated a $5.5 billion gap, but actual revenues came in $2.7 billion higher.
