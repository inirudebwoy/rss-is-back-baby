                    <span>Mach 30 Wind Tunnel Propels China Decades Ahead In Global Hypersonic Race 

            
Following conflicts over trade, technology, and capital markets, the US and China are locked in a great power competition, as some describe it as Thucydides Trap. We believe the battleground for global supremacy is heating up on the hypersonic front. 


According to South China Morning Post (SCMP), researcher Han Guilai, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said a new wind tunnel in Beijing will &quot;soon be unveiled&quot; and put China decades ahead of the West in hypersonic technology. 


Guilai told an online lecture in late May that the JF-22 wind tunnel, in Beijing&#x27;s Huairou district, was capable of simulating flights at 30 times the speed of sound. He said this would put China &quot;about 20 to 30 years a…</span>

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


A top senator in Pennsylvania said Saturday that he supports an audit of the 2020 presidential election.



“I support the call for an election audit, in order to answer any lingering questions that still remain about the fairness of the 2020 elections in Pennsylvania. This is the best path forward to address the legitimate concerns of the large majority of my constituents who voted to reelect President [Donald] Trump, as well as all Pennsylvanians,” state Sen. David Argall, a Republican who chairs the Pennsylvania Senate’s State Government Committee, told The Epoch Times in an emailed statement.

Last week, when Biden released his $6 trillion budget, we asked if it was a joke that the BIden budget saw just 2.1% inflation in 2021 and 2022.

Fast forward to this weekend, when Fed Chair Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen addressed our rhetorical concern, and following the G7 finmin meeting in London where the world&#x27;s most advanced nations agreed to impose a 15% minimum corporate tax rate (with zero enforcement provisions), said that contrary to the Biden Budget, inflation could climb as high as 3% this year in what the WaPo said was &quot;the first time the Biden administration projected …</span>

As small businesses complain that it has never been harder for them to hire workers according to a recent NFIB survey, many are facing growing pressure to survive. As the American economy continues to reopen, some fear it might not happen soon enough to save thousands of small businesses. Data from Alignable&#x27;s June Revenue Poll shows that 35% of all small business owners are still at risk of closing permanently by the end of the summer.


Among the 3,772 small business owners in the 10 days ended June 1, Alignable&#x27;s June Revenue Poll showed a myriad of factors - including the remaining closures and restrictions, growing inflationary pressures on prices, rising gas and transportation prices and la…</span>

Picking up on a joke we made earlier this week when we called Joe Biden the Six Trillion Dollar Man (in homage to a very deflationary Lee Majors) in response to the 12 zeroes contained in his budget, in his latest Weekly Kickstart note Goldman&#x27;s David Kostin writes that...

Surging construction costs to build a new home is not sustainable and is becoming a pain in the arse for homebuilders and prospective homebuyers. From concrete to lumber to copper pipes to paint and even appliances, costs have surged over the past year.

The housing boom sparked by the Federal Reserve during the virus pandemic was built on historically low mortgage rates (thanks to Powell) and accelerated by a combination of record-low inventory as city-dwellers moved to rural areas amid the remote-work phenomenon.

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


The Georgia Republican Party on Saturday approved a resolution censuring Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, local media reported.


The Georgia GOP during a convention approved a resolution that says Raffensperger, a Republican, failed to perform his duties in “accordance with the laws of the Constitution of the State of Georgia,” WSB-TV reported.







The document says the failure stemmed from Raffensperger entering into a settlement agreement with the Democratic Party of Georgia, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.


The agreement saw Raffensperger agree to promote …</span>

In the latest surreal and brazen example of federal government overreach, the FBI is demanding that USA Today turn over the IP addresses of all individuals who accessed a public online article during a specific time period. 


The subpoena was issued in April but is only in recent days being made public after the newspaper&#x27;s parent company Gannett sought to fight it in court. It&#x27;s being widely condemned as an outrageous instance of abuse not only of press freedom, but of the public&#x27;s right to access information and media as well as breach of both the 1st and 4th Amendments.

The number of COVID-19 deaths in Alameda County, California, fell by about 25 percent after health officials changed their methodology for total mortality count, removing those that were not a “direct result” of the disease, or “in whom death caused by COVID-19 could not be ruled out.”

Political rancor and tensions surround the 2020 election had many US companies trying to distance themselves from the process by halting political donations. This included one of the biggest sectors for buying influence, the arms industry.


After a few months to reexamine things, the arms companies are back to throwing money around, donating in large quantities to members of both parties involved in military spending, and trying to ensure that they stay on good terms with everyone responsible for their business’ contracts.

                    <span>NASA&#x27;s Mars Helicopter Prepares For 7th Flight On Sunday

            
Liftoff of NASA&#x27;s Mars helicopter Ingenuity will occur no later than today if all goes to plan, according to a NASA press release. 


Ingenuity, a small robotic helicopter weighing no more than 4 pounds, is preparing for its seventh flight today. The mission is to fly Ingenuity 350 feet south from its current location on the floor of Jezero Crater. 



&quot;This will mark the second time the helicopter will land at an airfield that it did not survey from the air during a previous flight,&quot; NASA wrote. &quot;Instead, the Ingenuity team is relying on imagery collected by the HiRISE camera aboard NASA&#x27;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that suggests this new base of operations is relatively flat and has few surface obstructions.&quot;



On May 22, Ingenuity flew its sixth mission that did not go so well. The solar-powered helicopter experienced glitches that interrupted internal systems. There was no mention of what caused the glitches; the craft was able to land safely. 







Ingenuity has marvelously performed five flights and beamed incredible images from Mars back to Earth. 


NASA also has the Perseverance rover conducting land-based missions in the search for life. 


In the last couple of months, the Red Planet has become a hotspot for the US and China, with China landing a rover of its own on the planet.


Sudden interest in Mars between both countries is because the planet allegedly has an abundance of rare metals that will power tomorrow&#x27;s economy.

In a surprise aggressive move, American and British troops are landing on the beaches in Normandy today. 







Germany’s Transocean News Service reports that Germans vacationing in the sleepy hamlets of this coastal region were awakened by the ships, planes, guns, and bombs of this sneak attack. A few brave German tourists quickly ran to bunkers and began returning fire to protect their French brothers and sisters.


Germany has already been subject to a horrifying 363 air raids by the Allied air forces in an attempt to terrorize its citizens. British bombers have already dropped over 45,000 tons of bombs while American aircraft dropped 23,000 tons. Nearly 1.7 mill…</span>

                    <span>The Importance Of Equity Duration

            
By Variant Perception


We have seen much commentary that if US 10y yields go back to 2.5% or 3.0%, then equity markets suffer.  We prefer a different way to looking at the problem.  The key is what inflation is doing alongside any move in nominal yields. The below chart shows the % of the US yield curve trading below inflation. We highlight in green the periods when more than 50% of the yield curve is trading below inflation (as is the case today).

Typically, negative real yields are very stimulative for equities.  It is only when most of the yield curve is trading above inflation (white bars in right chart above) that equity markets start to face persistent headwinds.


Equity investors do need to worry about rising yields in terms of sector rotation.  Duration is a basic concept for fixed income investors, but for equity investors, it is a less common method to look at portfolio exposures.


We have built a duration calculator for equities, using a combination of a 15-year DCF (consensus earnings forecasts, 2% terminal growth rate, individual cost of equity) and a terminal value duration component. This allows us to see which equities are most sensitive to a move in yields.


For the stocks in the Russell 1000, we calculate the duration of each name and aggregate to find the duration for different sectors. Financials, energy and consumer staples look like relative safe-havens. Info tech, healthcare and consumer discretionaries have the highest durations and are more vulnerable to yield moves.

Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),


California, with its relatively large tax burden compared to other states, has seen a taxpayer exodus in recent years and, along with it, billions in taxable gross income.


State-to-state migration data recently released by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shows that California lost an estimated net 70,534 households—or 165,355 taxpayers and their dependents—in the years 2017-2018, with those fleeing taking around $8.8 billion in net adjusted gross income with them.

We have written extensively in the past few months (here, here, here, and here) discussing the costs (both fiscally and to freedom) and consequences (both intended and unintended) of the so-called &quot;For The People&quot; Act, it appears at least one Democrat politician has decided that the power grab is too much.







In a sweeping op-ed in the Charleston Gazette-Mail, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) explained why he will vote against the sweeping election reform overhaul bill, putting the fate of the legislation in jeopardy in the evenly split Senate.

                    <span>&quot;Shot Heard Around The World&quot; - El Salvador President Pushes Bill To Adopt Bitcoin As Legal Tender

            
In a pre-recorded video, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele made a somewhat shocking announcement in the final hours of the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami on Saturday afternoon.







Bukele said Saturday he will send a bill to the Central American country&#x27;s Congress next week to make bitcoin legal tender.



#Bitcoin has a market cap of $680 billion dollars.

If 1% of it is invested in El Salvador, that would increase our GDP by 25%.

On the other side, #Bitcoin will have 10 million potential new users and the fastest growing way to transfer 6 billion dollars a year in remittances.

“Drift. Apathy. Distrust,” barked Biggie Too, feeling it, already in a groove.  “Frustration. Irritation. Uneasy anticipation,” continued the chief global strategist for one of Wall Street’s Too-Big-To-Fail affairs.


“Biggie got this deep dark feeling he’s way too early,” whispered Too, lips pursed, right at home in 3rd person. “We lost our faith in politicians and the media. Institutions. Now we’re losing trust in science, our scientists, Biggie sees them cracks spreading,” said Biggie, pointing to his bank of screens, Fauci getting Fox’d.

If you had said during the beginning of the pandemic we&#x27;d be talking about whether or not retailer GameStop and dying movie chain AMC would be moved from the Russell 2000 up to the large cap Russell 1000 - instead of being dropped from the index altogether - people would have assumed you were joking.


But now that question is legitimately on the table thanks to the astronomical run in both names and the upcoming Russell Reconstitution, according to Bloomberg.


The reconstitution, which takes place on June 25, is going to affect more than $10 trillion in investors&#x27; assets and exchange volumes are usually &quot;among the heaviest of the year&quot; around the time it happens.

By Michael Wilson, chief equity strategist of Morgan Stanley


Over the past few weeks, we’ve been spending a lot of time with investors discussing and debating our mid-year outlook. Here are the highlights:



First, investors are definitely more receptive to the mid-cycle transition narrative that we introduced a few months ago. There’s an acknowledgement that something has changed in the market, because more investors are struggling to make money consistently as leadership flip-flops day to day. This is consistent with the typical mid-cycle transition as the market struggles to find the next consensus trade.

Authored by Bryce Coward via Knowledge Leaders Capital blog,


For the second month in a row, the US payroll employment report has come in below expectations. The miss this month was not quite as bad as the miss last month, but was still notable. The market was expecting 675K new jobs, but only 559K were added.


Nearly all of the jobs added were in the leisure &amp; hospitality and education categories. This is unsurprising given re-openings will affect those sectors particularly acutely. But, for the second month in a row we also saw fairly weak numbers out of both construction and manufacturing. Construction jobs fell by 20K while manufacturing jobs only rose by 23K after a 32K decline in April. F…</span>

For the past several months, Morgan Stanley&#x27;s fundamental analysts have been turning increasingly bearish on stocks, with the pessimistic sentiment plateauing earlier this week when chief equity strategist Michael Wilson said that there is far too much optimism in the market, and that while earnings are slowly rising, forward PE multiples are far too high and are set to slide, with &quot;the de-rating about 75% to go or an approximate 15% decline in P/Es from here.&quot; As a result, in Wilson&#x27;s view - which is rapidly emerging as the most bearish on Wall Street - &quot;earnings revisions will not be able to offset that de-rating, leaving the overall market vulnerable to a 10-15 % correction over the…</span>

A person believed to be among the highest-ranking defectors ever to the United States from the People’s Republic of China has been working with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for months, sources inside the intelligence community have told RedState on condition of anonymity.







The defector has direct knowledge of special weapons programs in China, including bioweapons programs, those sources say.


The information provided to RedState corroborates and clarifies Thursday evening’s reporting by journalist Adam Housley.

                    <span>An Inconvenient Truth: EVs May Offer A &quot;Negligible&quot; CO2 Difference From ICE Vehicles

            
Are the carbon footprints of EVs really as drastically lower than that of internal combustion engine vehicles? When considering the amount of carbon and CO2 created from assembling lithium ion batteries, one firm thinks the difference could be &quot;negligible&quot;.


Such was the topic of a new blog post by natural resource investors Goehring &amp; Rozencwajg (G&amp;R), a &quot;fundamental research firm focused exclusively on contrarian natural resource investments with a team with over 30 years of dedicated resource experience.&quot;


The firm, established in 2015, posted a blog entry entitled &quot;Exploring Lithium-ion Electric Vehicles’ Carbon Footprint&quot; this week, where they call into question a former ICE vs. …</span>

1. U.S. Taxpayer Money Did Go to Controversial ‘Gain of Function’ Research


Thanks to some confusing verbal gymnastics by Dr. Anthony Fauci, some in the media are giving the impression that there’s no proof U.S. tax money funded “gain of function” research or that, perhaps, the research didn’t qualify as gain of function. However, the evidence on this point is clear cut.


A 2015 published study specifically discloses that the research is gain of function research that took bat coronavirus that was harmless to people—and made it infectious in humans. The study further states that the National Institutes of He…</span>

Last month we noted how hedge fund managers have been descending on Puerto Rico in the hopes of dodging Biden tax hikes, and to take advantage of tax incentives rolled out in 2012 which have lured high net-worth individuals, corporations and cryptocurrency traders alike.







If you fall under any of the above and you&#x27;re falsely claiming to be a resident of Puerto Rico, the IRS has a message for you: &#x27;We&#x27;re waiting for you...&#x27; 


According to Bloomberg Tax, the agency has been the focus of a &quot;sweeping&quot; review to examine individuals who took advantages of the tax incentives. According to the report, &quot;More than 4,000 mainland U.S. residents and firms have moved to the territory between 20…</span>

                    <span>Watch Live: Trump Returns To Political Stage At NC GOP Convention

            
Donald Trump will return to the political stage Saturday night with a speech at the North Carolina Republican Convention - his first major speech since CPAC in February, but more importantly - his first since he was vindicated over the possibility that COVID-19 escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.







It also comes after anti-Trump GOP Congresswoman Liz Cheney (WY) was outed from her leadership position due to her frequent criticism of Trump.


In a Friday statement, the former president said that it would be &quot;a great honor to be speaking at the North Carolina GOP convention,&quot; adding &quot;I understand the place will be packed, all records broken!&quot;


Trump carried North Carolina during both of his presidential bids - visiting the state 14 times during the final year of his presidency. He&#x27;s scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. to a sold out audience of 1,250 people.

                    <span>COVID, Learned Helplessness, And Control

            
Via WeMeantWell.com,


In the post-vaccination era, why don’t people remove their masks? Learned helplessness, employed as a control tool.







Learned helplessness is well-documented. It takes place when an individual believes he continuously faces a negative, uncontrollable situation and stops trying to improve his circumstances, even when he has the ability to do so. Discovering the loss of control elicits a passive reaction to a harmful situation. Psychologists call this a maladaptive response, characterized by avoidance of challenges and the collapse of problem-solving when obstacles arise. You give up trying to fight back.


An example may help: you must keep up with ever-changing mask and other hygiene theatre rules,…</span>

Albuquerque International Sunport received distress calls from the plane after a passenger attempted to breach the cabin, airport spokeswoman Stephanie Kitts, who was quoted by USA Today. 


Cellphone video captured the incident and one brave flight attendant who &quot;tackled and zip-tied the man before anyone was harmed,&quot; said Fox 11 Los Angeles.

                    <span>A Couple Things About Inflation

            
Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


The higher they push phantom &quot;assets&quot; based on exponential increases in leverage, the greater the air gap between essential tangibles and fantasy.


Inflation is in the news, but there are a couple of things about inflation that don&#x27;t get much coverage. Let&#x27;s start with the trope that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. Actually, no.


When nutrient-rich soil and fresh water reserves are depleted, crop yields decline and as human population and appetites for animal protein soar, food becomes scarce. When food becomes scarce, prices rise accordingly. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you do with money supply, prices will rise in relation to everything used as &quot;money:&quot; gold, shells, paper …</span>

                    <span>Hong Kong Parking Spot Sells For Record-Breaking $1.3 Million

            
Even as thousands of Hong Kongers flee to the UK or elsewhere to escape China&#x27;s crackdown on political freedoms, the city-state&#x27;s property market is breaking yet another record.


Citing a report in the Hong Kong Economic Times, Bloomberg reports that Wharf Holdings and Nan Fung Group sold a parking space for HK$10.2 million ($1.3 million) at the luxury Mount Nicholson residential project, according to a source. The price beat the previous record of HK$7.6 million for a spot in an office tower set back in 2019, before Hong Kong&#x27;s protest movement triggered a crackdown by Beijing that has engulfed the territory&#x27;s future in uncertainty, especially since China can simply snatch anyone - foreign nationals or otherwise - from Hong Kong&#x27;s jurisdiction.







Mount Nicholson has a reputation for being one of the most iconic upscale projects in Hong Kong. At one point, an apartment in the project was the most expensive in Asia before the title was taken by CK Asset Holdings Ltd.’s 21 Borrett Road in February.


As that record-breaking sale might suggest, the parking spot record isn&#x27;t a total surprise. HK has been seeing a comeback in the luxury home market in recent months, seeing record-breaking transactions as buyer&#x27;s confidence returns. A house on Hong Kong&#x27;s famous Peak (a luxury residential area overlooking the rest of the city) just rented for HK$1.6 a month in May.


Still, despite its recent sharp rebound, Hong Kong&#x27;s economy &quot;isn&#x27;t out of the woods just yet,&quot; according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau. HK&#x27;s economy grew 7.9% in the first quarter of 2021 vs. a year ago, marking the first economic expansion after six consecutive quarters of contraction. Yau appeared on CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Squawk Box Asia&quot; Thursday morning to discuss it.





While retail sales have seen a strong rebound, tourism remains weak, and the expansion is on uneven footing, Yau said.

Authored by Finn Andersen via The Mises Institute,


Recently, Joe Rogan, one of the largest podcast hosts in the United States (10.6 million YouTube subscribers), expressed the following opinion about the vaccination of young adults:



If you are 21 and ask me if you should get the vaccine, I would say &quot;no&quot;. If you are a healthy person and exercise all the time, and are young and eat well, I don&#x27;t think you have to worry about this.



Joe Rogan is correct about the COVID vaccine for kids &amp; young healthy people.pic.twitter.com/AxGwFxAMVB

An official event at the Yale School of Medicine featured a New York-based psychiatrist telling students she fantasizes about &quot;unloading a revolver into the head of any white person that got in my way.&quot;


Disturbingly the talk entitled &quot;The Psychopathic Problem of the White Mind&quot; was held as part of the continuing program, the Child Study Center Grand rounds. The event was held in April, but audio only late this week of New York-based Dr. Aruna Khilanani gleefully musing about murdering white people became available and was posted on journalist Bari Weiss&#x27;s Substack.

Authored by Rita Li via The Epoch Times,


A recent report documented up to 6,000 foreign fishing vessels that disabled their public tracking devices for more than 24 hours along the border of Argentina’s national waters, sounding the alarm that they could be illegally fishing in the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).


“The Chinese fleet was responsible for 66 percent of these incidents,” said the June report by Oceana, a Washington-based non-profit organization dedicated to protecting and restoring the global oceans. The report claims that hundreds of Chinese fishing vessels mainly target shortfin squid, which is vital to both Argentina’s economy and ecosystem.

Taiwan is about to be front and center again this coming week as Washington prepares for its next shot across China&#x27;s bow - this time by another high level US delegation, something which China has long condemned as &quot;signaling pro-democracy forces&quot; on the island in contradiction to the official One China policy. 


Reuters has confirmed in a weekend report that &quot;Three US senators will visit Taiwan on Sunday and will meet President Tsai Ing-wen to discuss security and other issues, Taiwan&#x27;s government and the de facto U.S. embassy in Taipei said on Saturday, a trip that will likely irritate China.&quot; The meeting is expected to be held at a military wing of the island&#x27;s main international airport.

Authored by Mark Jeftovic via BombThrower.com,


Earlier today the news started coming out that the US will start treating ransomware on par with terrorism. This is in the wake of a string of catastrophic attacks, not only ransomware but also several supply chain attacks.


There is some concern within crypto-currency circles that this may turn into a new FUD-cycle for Bitcoin. There is already no shortage of lo-res intellects calling for a ban on Bitcoin and crypto-currencies, thinking that even if cryptos could be banned (they can’t) that it would eliminate the problem of ransomware.


It wouldn’t.


Here’s why:


Ransomware attacks are neither enabled nor incentivized by the existence of Bitcoin. …</span>

                    <span>&quot;Stonks On The Moon&quot;: There&#x27;s Now A Children&#x27;s Book Based On The GameStop Short Squeeze

            
There&#x27;s now officially a children&#x27;s book based on the &quot;Great GME Squeeze of 2021&quot;.


Amazon has started selling a book called &quot;Stonks On The Moon!&quot; which tells the story - in children&#x27;s parlance - of the &quot;mayhem being inflicted on Wall Street by a new wave of retail investors championing the cause of GameStop Corp,&quot; according to WeBull.


The story tells the tale of Stonks, a young ape, who is helped along by a character based on Keith &quot;Roaring Kitty&quot; Gill in building a rocket to visit the moon. 


According to WeBull, the book&#x27;s author, who goes by the name &quot;Professor Clark&quot; is actually Dillon Clark, who calls himself &quot;an IT professional at a bank in the middle of Illinois in the middle of a cornfield.&quot; 







Clark said: “It&#x27;s kind of a children&#x27;s book for adults and children. A kid can read it and be like, ‘Hey, I understand it. I get a good message from it.&#x27; But then the adult can read it and be like, ‘Oh, I see what&#x27;s going on there&#x27;.”


“It&#x27;s been great,” he stated. “All the apes on Reddit have been super, super nice.”


Clark is also holding out hope that Elon Musk will read the audio version: “I think ‘Stonks on the Moon!’ would be awesome if Elon Musk narrated. I&#x27;ve been tweeting at him every day for the last 35 days, and I&#x27;m doing it for a year straight.”


The book is 25 pages and already has 35 reviews with an average of 5 stars on Amazon, where it started selling on May 27. 







Meanwhile, the Fed still sees no signs of market excess...

Authored by Mimi Nguyen Ly via The Epoch Times,


Microsoft on Friday said that its search engine Bing yielded no results when users entered the query “tank man” in the United States and elsewhere for part of Friday because of “accidental human error.”







Users in the United States and other countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and Singapore, reported that Bing returned the message “There are no results for tank man” when they tried to search the term.


Meanwhile, rival search engine Google, on the other hand, returned many results for the image when the “tank man” query was entered on Friday.


Some social media users raised concerns that Bing, one of the few …</span>

The day after Putin announced the completion of the first leg of the Russia-to-Germany natural gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, declaring that essentially Washington&#x27;s best efforts to halt it via an avalanche of sanctions have been defeated, Germany appears to have seconded his assessment.


German Ambassador to Russia Geza Andreas von Geyr on Saturday in his own statements on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum said that US efforts are illegal, going against international law.

Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,


Over the last few week’s we discussed the ongoing “buy signals” suggesting the market could retest all-time highs. That occurred this week. However, as stated last week:



“The good news is that we did indeed get the rally we were expecting. The not-so-good news is that the rally already consumed a majority of the ‘buy signal.’ Such does not mean the market is about to correct; it does suggest that upside remains limited near term.”








As shown in the bottom panel, the RIA PRO “Money Flow” signal is now into overbought territory. While the markets could undoubtedly break out to new highs next week, the upside remains limited. Such is due to the weekly sig…</span>

While the luminaries of the crypto world are spending millions of dollar to pitch their favorite tokens and technologies at the world&#x27;s largest cryptoconference in Miami (which due to organizational issues has also been compared to the infamous Fyre Festival scam) hoping to push the prices of bitcoin and its peers higher, Elon Musk had other plans.


First, on Thursday evening, bitcoin tumbled after the Tesla billionaire issued a cryptic tweet that many interpreted as the billionaire’s breakup with bitcoin. The tweet, which included the bitcoin logo and a broken-heart emoji, hinted that Musk may have sold some or all of Tesla&#x27;s bitcoin holdings purchased at the start of the year (Musk has yet to confirm or deny that…</span>

Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times,


Minneapolis saw an outbreak of unrest on Friday night, after a vigil and protests over the shooting death of a man by members of a U.S. Marshals task force devolved into chaotic scenes of looting, arson, and vandalism.

The second night of protests followed Thursday’s fatal shooting of 32-year-old Winston Boogie Smith Jr., who was wanted on a weapons violation and fired a gun before two deputies shot him.


Members of the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force were trying to arrest Smith on a warrant for allegedly being a felon in possessi…</span>

Liberals are probably having a meltdown after a George W. Bush-appointed federal judge in California ruled the state&#x27;s ban on assault weapons is unconstitutional. 







U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez of San Diego released a 94-page ruling late Friday, indicating California&#x27;s three-decade ban on assault weapons violates the Second Amendment&#x27;s right to bear arms.

A number of events are coming together which are set to push gold prices higher. Besides a combination of continuing inflationary policies and massive future budget deficits undermining the dollar, by closing down derivative market activities new Basel 3 regulations appear set to deflect some demand into physical metals. Furthermore, liquidity in gold markets will contract, potentially making prices more volatile

The G7 group of advanced economies reached a landmark deal Saturday to end the race to the bottom on taxes. 


Finance ministers - from US, UK, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, and Japan - met in London Saturday and agreed to a minimum global corporation tax rate of at least 15%, and also had put in mechanisms within the deal to ensure multinational companies operating in other countries were paying their fair share of taxes.

As even many casual observers of America’s fractious politics are aware, the overwhelming majority of lawmaking at the federal level no longer takes place in Congress as the Constitution’s framers intended. Instead, the vast majority of the “rulemaking” governing Americans’ day-to-day lives now takes place behind closed doors, deep in the bowels of the administrative state’s sprawling bureaucracy. The brainchild of progressive President Woodrow Wilson, arguments on behalf of the modern administrative state are ultimately rooted in, among other factors, a disdain for the messy give-and-take of republican politics and an epistemological preference for rul…</span>

Cows produce significant amounts of methane as part of their digestive processes. Cow belching, a source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, could be solved by a new methane-absorbing wearable device. 


According to Bloomberg, agriculture behemoth Cargill Inc. tapped UK-based startup Zelp Ltd., which is dedicated to significantly reducing the environmental impact of the livestock industry through smart cow masks that filter methane burps. 







Cargill said Tuesday the devices would be used for its European dairy farmers in 2022. The price of each mask has yet to be publicly discussed, but Zelp said each cow would cost $80 per year as part of an annual subscription fee.

By Construction Dive,




	
Closures due to the Covid pandemic resulted in $9.8 billion in lost construction activity and 74,000 direct and indirect lost jobs in New York City, according to a report by the Building Trades Employers’ Association. The decline in jobs contributed to a $5.5 billion loss in total wages, the report said.

	

	

	
The decline in activity also affected the city&#x27;s Minority and Women Business Enterprises, as more than 85% of MWBEs are expected to be out of businesses in the next six months, according to a New York City Comptroller&#x27;s Office survey cited in the report.

South Korea has become ground zero for speculative crypto traders looking to try and build wealth by hoisting their life savings into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.


This means wild successes when the price bitcoin and other coins moves higher, but also devastating mood swings when cryptos crash.

Authored by Jon Sanders via The American Institute for Economic Research,


If you’re among those of us who aren’t tribally invested in Covid politics but would like good information about when life will resume as normal, chances are you’re interested in herd immunity. You’re likely not interested in having to rely on the Internet Archive for good information on herd immunity. Alas, it’s become a go-to place for retrieving, as it were, previously published information on herd immunity that became inconvenient post-vaccine and then virtually Memory-Holed.

                    <span>Temple Business Dean Asks Judge To Dismiss Charges For Manipulating MBA Ranking Data

            
Former Temple University business school dean Moshe Porat is defending inflating his school&#x27;s ranking to U.S. News and World Report by feeding the periodical false data. 


Porat asked a judge to dismiss fraud charges against him in a May 28 court filing, claiming &quot;that the government hadn’t sufficiently shown that he profited from the alleged scheme,&quot; Bloomberg reports.


This was, of course, while he was running the school&#x27;s Richard J. Fox School of Business, which he headed up for more than 20 years. 


Porat&#x27;s lawyers argued that &quot;the Supreme Court had previously established that a certain amount of monetary gain was necessary to sustain a wire fraud charge&quot; and that such a gain c…</span>

Authored by Ryan McMaken via The Mises Institute,


In twenty-first century America, millions of Americans—Christians and social conservatives especially—are finding that the nation’s most influential institutions appear to be implacably hostile toward them.


These institutions include universities, public schools, the news media, and government bureaucracies. Moreover, corporate America has increasingly embraced a posture of hostility toward groups considered to be “right wing” or conservative.

                    <span>Manhattan Office Supply Continues To Soar Even As City Reopens 

            
More than a year since the virus pandemic began, New York City&#x27;s economy is roaring back open. But at least one segment of the metro area&#x27;s economy remains in dire straits: the office space market. 


According to Bloomberg, citing a commercial real estate brokerage report by Colliers, Manhattan&#x27;s supply of office space continues to hit new records even as leasing increases. 


The availability rate rose for a 12th straight month in May to 17%; inventory since the pandemic began jumped 70% to a whopping 92 million square feet. 


Colliers had some good news. It said demand is coming back with leases increasing 8% versus last May, while the average asking rents rose 0.4% to $73.26 a square foot.

The Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami kicked off today with libertarian and ex-presidential candidate Ron Paul slamming the Federal Reserve and saying that Bitcoin needs be “considered seriously,” given the current state of the economy and the Fed’s monetary policy.

After Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) revealed this week that her grandmother is living in a dilapidated home in Puerto Rico, which she blamed on former President Trump, scores of people began wondering why the well-off Congresswoman (who lied about growing up poor) allowed her abuela to live in squalor while she lives it up in DC.

After more than two years of UFO &#x27;evidence&#x27; via the New York Times detailing dozens of encounters between Navy pilots and unidentified aerial phenomena, the punchline - according to an upcoming government report, is: &#x27;we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s aliens, but it&#x27;s not Americans&#x27; - and therefore America should probably spend untold billions on figuring out how to make 90-degree turns at mach 5 and disappear into the ocean, after disabling a nuclear installation.


Or, as journalist Caitlin Johnstone puts it: The MSM is wasting no time using the UFO report to promote an arms race.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Most Americans believe that the coronavirus pandemic originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, with almost a quarter saying they believe it was released on purpose, according to a YouGov poll.







A total of 58% of Americans agree that its is ‘definitely or probably true’ that the virus came out of the Wuhan lab.



Wuhan virus, most agree.

58% believe China made the virus in a lab, and 24% say it was ‘released on purpose.&#x27; Sound familiar...https://t.co/j0BqPTWxdc pic.twitter.com/tTuWMEtG2C

— Paul Bedard (@SecretsBedard) June 3, 2021


The number represents a nine percent increase on findings from a year ago.


Even 43% of Democrats believe the virus came out of the lab.

Only 13% are still buying the ‘it mutated naturally from bats’ claim.


Indeed, YouGov notes “When it comes to the more specific circumstances of the virus’ emergence, 24% think it was created in a laboratory and was released on purpose, 18% think it was lab-created and escaped by accident, while a further 12% think it was a naturally occurring disease that was being examined in a laboratory but was released by accident.”


This is despite a massive co-ordinated attempt by the establishment media and big-tech to censor and dismiss the lab leak idea as a crazy ‘conspiracy theory’.

I always thought that if you lived through a revolution it would be obvious to everyone. As it turns out, that’s not true. Revolutions can be bloodless, incremental and subtle. And they don’t require a strongman. They just require a sufficient number of well-positioned true believers and cowards, like those sitting in the C-suite of nearly every major institution in American life.

Revered scientific journal The Lancet has created a ‘task force’ to investigate the origins of the coronavirus that caused a global pandemic, yet it has decided to employ as it’s leader the very guy who funded the dangerous gain of function research at the Wuhan lab and subsequently allegedly ‘bullied’ other scientists into avoiding looking into the lab as a potential source of the outbreak.







In the wake of renewed scrutiny of the lab leak hypothesis, the Lancet’s task force will reportedly “focus on analyzing data on all of the theories put forward on the origins of COVID, on the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 was …</span>

Two months ago we first made a remarkable observation: despite some 100 million Americans not in the labor force (of which 94 million do not want a job)...







... there is now a full-blown labor shortage in the US, for one simple reason - trillions in Biden stimulus are now incentivizing potential workers not to seek gainful employment, but to sit back and collect the next stimmy check for doing absolutely nothing in what is becoming the world&#x27;s greatest &quot;under the radar&quot; experiment in Universal Basic Income.

                    <span>Traders Rush To Ship Masked Venezuelan Crude To China

            
Authored by Charles Kennedy via OilPrice.com,


Commodity traders are in a rush to ship as much Venezuelan heavy crude to China as possible before a new fuel tax kicks in, causing a 40-50-percent rise in prices, Reuters reports, citing industry insiders and shipping data.







Over the last 12 months, China has seen a 13-fold increase in imports of bitumen blends, some 90 percent of which was actually heavy crude from Venezuela, according to data from cargo tracker Vortexa Analytics. The crude was labeled as Malaysian bitumen blend to avoid sanction action from the United States.


According to Vortexa, the average daily rate of Venezuelan oil imports into China over the past year was some 324,000 barrels, which represented about two-thirds of Venezuela&#x27;s total exports of crude during the period.


However, things are about to change as China plans to introduce a tax on bitumen blend imports later this month. This will increase prices by 40 to 50 percent, and the flow of Venezuelan oil may well thin considerably.



&quot;While not all of the 350,000 to 400,000 bpd of the additional bitumen flowing into China will disappear overnight, a large proportion of it will be at risk,&quot; an Energy Aspects analyst told Reuters.



U.S. sanctions have reduced Venezuelan oil output to some half a million barrels daily over the two years since they were introduced.







Even though the Biden administration has extended a sanction waiver for several U.S. oil companies, including Chevron and Halliburton, PDVSA is struggling to maintain production.


Earlier this year, the state-owned oil major calculated it would need investments of $58 billion to boost production to where it was before Hugo Chavez rose to power in the late 90s. In 1998, Venezuela was pumping 2.3 million barrels of crude daily. The company said it planned to seek investments from both local and foreign companies to that end.

                    <span>G-7 Nears Deal On New International Corporate Tax Framework Despite Resistance From Ireland

            
Ahead of the G-20 summit in the UK later this month, finance ministers from the G-7 are reportedly on the cusp of a deal for a minimum corporate tax rate of &quot;at least 15%&quot;, while differences remain about how megacap tech firms should be taxed. The group will hold a series of virtual and in-person meetings over the weekend where talks will continue.


According to Bloomberg, the ministers are meeting on Friday and Saturday in London, and will likely release a statement over the weekend once they have settled on a mutually-agreeable framework. However, a deal involving just the members of the G-7 won&#x27;t amount to much, since developed economies with competitive corporate tax rates (li…</span>

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Senator Rand Paul, who has constantly challenged the contradictory and unscientific statements of Dr Fauci, as well as pointing out Fauci’s involvement in funding gain of function research with coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, appeared vindicated in an interview Thursday following disturbing revelations from released emails, which Paul urged should be the final nail in Fauci’s coffin.







Speaking to Laura Ingraham, Paul asserted that “The emails paint a disturbing picture, a disturbing picture of Dr. Fauci, from the very beginning, worrying that he had been funding gain-of-function research. He knows it to this day, but hasn’t admitted it.”

                    <span>22.4 Down, 14.7 Up, 7.6 To Go: &quot;The Fed Faces A Difficult Decision&quot;

            
After today’s mixed US payrolls report, today’s Chart of the Day from DB&#x27;s Jim Reid shows we are still 7.6 million jobs away from where we were when the pandemic hit. 


We lost 22.4 million in the first 2 months and have gained 14.7 million over the last 13 months. 2021 has &quot;only&quot; seen an average monthly payrolls increase of 478k though May.







And while some saw only disappointment in the May jobs data, it was a truly Goldilocks report: as Reid says, &quot;there was clearly something for everyone in the report. The Fed will continue to suggest they are a long way from their employment goals and the inflationists will cite the higher earnings in the release as evidence that it&#x27;s hard to find employees at the right price.&quot;


Meanwhile, according to BofA, the report leaves the Fed &quot;to remain patient, slowly and carefully taking baby steps to set the stage for tapering but unlikely to send an explicit signal until the September FOMC meeting.&quot;


Maybe, Reid asks, you can have a relatively slow jobs recovery and inflation.



&quot;If that does happen then the Fed will have difficult decisions to make at some point.&quot; 



On that, the DB strategist concludes that &quot;next week&#x27;s US CPI will be the most watched economic report of the year so far.&quot;

Real Vision editors Max Wiethe and Jack Farley make sense of a truly odd week, one that began with the reappearance of memestock mania and ended with the S&amp;P 500 flirting with all-time highs (and with the VIX very close to a pre-pandemic low). Farley and Wiethe cover today’s strong rally in stocks as well as bonds, on the release of the U.S. non-farm payrolls data which missed economist expectations. Farley inspects Bill Ackman’s latest plans to acquire a slice of Universal Music Group via his SPAC, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings ($PSTH), and Wiethe looks forward to next week’s Fed meeting and release of the latest inflation data.

Authored by MN Gordon via EconomicPrism.com,


Jerome Powell might be done as a useful Federal Reserve Chairman.  Not that Fed Chairs provide a use that’s of any real value.  They mainly excel at destroying the wealth of wage earners and savers for the benefit of member banks.


But as Powell loses a grip on price inflation the business of supplying credit at a fixed rate of return becomes less fruitful.  Consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), is rising at an annual rate of 4.2 percent.  That’s well above interest rate of a 30 year fixed mortgage, which is currently 3.1 percent.


It doesn’t take much imagination to foresee a CPI over 6 percent.  At that rate of price inflation, what good t…</span>

Despite objections from government scientists and prominent businessmen, Japan is planning to move ahead with the postponed 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo next month. In an interview with the Japanese press, the president of the 2020 Games, Seiko Hashimoto, declared that the games would move ahead as planned, with the Japanese government taking certain precautions to prevent an outbreak of mutant COVID. 







&quot;We cannot postpone again,&quot; Hashimoto told the Nikkan Sports newspaper via Reuters.


Hashimoto, who competed in seven summer and winter Olympics as a cyclist and skater, also told the BBC that while Japanese were understandably worried, they should be reassured …</span>

The COVID-19 epidemic in Guangdong province continues to worsen. The Epoch Times has learned that one of the busiest commercial streets in the mega city of Shenzhen has just been closed due to infection. Meanwhile, in the provincial capital of Guangzhou city, food and medicine shortages have been reported in locked down areas.

In the US, the first winners of the &quot;vaccination lotteries&quot; being adopted by a growing number of states - including West Virginia (which is offering guns, trucks &amp; &quot;piles of cash), California and a handful of others - are taking home life-changing money, all because they decided to get vaccinated.







And according to WSJ, the incentives that these programs create are already having a positive impact on the vaccination rate, which has finally eclipsed 50% of American adults. The program is also having some success in Hong Kong.

A proposed Chinese wind farm in Texas poses national security concerns, warned China-watcher and hedge fund manager Kyle Bass.







The Blue Hills Wind development in southwest Texas’s Val Verde County has attracted heightened scrutiny in recent months, with lawmakers and experts signaling concern that the Chinese project could be used as a cover for espionage and to disrupt the state’s power grid.


The proposed wind farm site is about 30 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border and near the Laughlin Air Force Base, the U.S. Air Force’s largest pilot training facility.

Bill Ackman&#x27;s massive SPAC is reportedly nearing a transaction to take public Universal Music Group, the world’s largest music business, at a valuation of about $40 billion, the WSJ reported citing sources.


Back in July, Ackman’s special purpose acquisition company, called Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd., raised $4 billion in an initial public offering - a record amount for a SPAC to this day, as Ackman said that his firm was on the hunt for a “mature unicorn&quot;:

Authored by Glenn Greenwald via greenwald.substack.com,


One of the most significant events of the last two decades has been largely memory-holed: the October, 2001 anthrax attacks in the U.S. Beginning just one week after 9/11 and extending for another three weeks, a highly weaponized and sophisticated strain of anthrax had been sent around the country through the U.S. Postal Service addressed to some of the country&#x27;s most prominent political and media figures. As Americans were still reeling from the devastation of 9/11, the anthrax killed five Americans and sickened another seventeen.

With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu engaged in desperate 11th hour scrambling to try and pick off enough lawmakers on the right-wing to deny a power-sharing government under an unlikely coalition formed by Yamina leader Naftali Bennett, Yesh Atid head Yair Lapid and Ra&#x27;am (United Arab List) chairman Mansour Abbas - Iran has taken a moment to mock Israel&#x27;s longest serving prime minister as he&#x27;s on his way out.


Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif in a Thursday tweet said farewell to Netanyahu and his &quot;disgraceful&quot; political journey which has taken he and his allies &quot;into the dustbin of history&quot;.

During America’s first-ever national lockdown, thousands of unelected bureaucrats, as well as federal and state governments, assumed enormous powers not usually accorded to them.







They picked and chose which businesses could stay open without much rationale. They sent the infected into nursing homes occupied by the weak and vulnerable.


Their rules for prosecuting those who violated social distancing, sheltering in place, mask wearing or violent protesting often hinged on political grounds. Their spending measures on “infrastructure” and “health care” were excuses to lard up redistributive entitlements.

Think wage wars are only taking place among minimum wage workers, who (until September at least) are getting paid more from Uncle Sam to stay home and do nothing? Think again.


Amid numerous anecdotes of sticky wages at the high-end of the jobs spectrum, one stands out: as Bloomberg reports today, in September 2020, the Palo Alto-based Cooley law firm announced it was handing out $2,500 to $7,500 in one-time payments to associates. The bonuses came as the firm -  along with many others in the legal industry - realized it was both flush with cash and facing worker burnout during the pandemic.

Electric cars giant Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) said it expects to soon begin buying more than $1 billion a year of Australian lithium, nickel and other critical minerals for its batteries and engines. Chairman Robyn Denholm said the country has taken important steps towards cleaning its image of polluting commodities exporter and it is poised to become a globally significant supplier of climate change solutions.


“Australia has the minerals to power the renewable energy age throughout the world in the coming years,” Denholm, an Australian, said in a speech during a Minerals Council of Australia event.

Update (1800ET): Just when you thought it was safe to turn off your AMC-focused mind, after an extremely volatile trading day, AMC filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC in connection with the Company’s 2021 Annual Meeting scheduled for July 29, 2021.


The preliminary proxy statement, which is subject to SEC review, includes the following important proposals:

This will hardly come as a surprise to anyone who followed the manic reddit-driven action over the past 48 hours: according to Goldman&#x27;s Prime Brokerage, we just witnessed the &quot;largest US single stock short covering since mid-March amid a sharp rally in High Retail Sentiment stocks&quot; and while US stocks saw modest net buying yesterday, it was driven by risk-off flows &quot;with short covers outpacing long sales 3 to 1.&quot;


The catalyst is well known: a furious, face-ripper of a rally in the heavily-shorted meme stocks, which pushed the Goldman Retail Sentiment Basket, (GSCBHTBR) i.e., the retail favorite stocks up +25% yesterday and up +61% over the last 7 sessions!

Isn’t is amazing how quickly things seem to change when it’s in the interest of those that think they run the world? For years we’ve been trying to get access to Hillary Clinton’s missing e-mails as Secretary of State but to no avail. However, at the most opportune time in the collapsing COVID story, Dr. Anthony Fauci’s emails are uncovered and broadcast to the world.


The same mechanism, FOIA, that Hillary has stonewalled us on for six years uncovers Fauci’s emails in six weeks?







Doesn’t that strike you as just the slightest bit odd?

Someone should put Elon Musk on notice: the legacy automakers have officially entered the EV sales fray.


And domestic U.S. automakers have officially hit the ground running.


Ford announced on Thursday that U.S. sales were up 4.1% to 161,725 units in May, while YTD sales were up 11.3%. The &quot;everything bubble&quot; created by Central Banks helped truck sales rise 11.6% over the same period and SUV sales to rise 48.6%. These numbers were despite the auto industry continuing to grapple with a semiconductor shortage - one that had even left Ford trucks stranded on the side of the road, waiting for parts, earlier this year. 


But the standout in Ford&#x27;s report? EV sales were up 184% to 10,364 units. The company al…</span>

It appears the Biden administration has realized their ambitious tax hikes have a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell of passing, given the slim majority Democrats hold in both chambers of Congress - which include two serious moderates (Manchin and Sinema) and a parliamentarian who won&#x27;t let them get away with forcing legislation through via reconciliation (a simple majority).


Now, according to the Washington Post, Biden has outlined a plan for $1 trillion in new spending financed through tax changes which would not focus on raising the top corporate rate - a major concession to Republicans who opposed an earlier proposal to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


For about 1 in 4, Social Security provides at least 90 percent of their income.


How many retired workers are getting less than $1,000 per month in Social Security benefits? The question came up and I was curious enough to find the answer, and download the data into an Excel spreadsheet which I saved as a PDF that you can review here. Note that this data is for the 46.5 million retired workers only, and does not include benefits paid to survivors, spouses, disabled, etc.


This led to a deep dive into the basic numbers of Social Security beneficiaries and expenses, which are summarized in the chart below. Here are the basics:

Update (1650ET): It appears former President Trump has read a few more of Fauci&#x27;s real ouchies exposed by the FOIA-driven email extravaganza and he doesn&#x27;t like what he&#x27;s reading.


In a statement released via NewsMax&#x27;s Steve Cortes, Trump demands reparations from China for unleashing hell on the world...



Now everyone, even the so-called &quot;enemy&quot;, are beginning to say that President Trump was right about the China Virus coming from the Wuhan Lab.


The correspondence between Dr. Fauci and China speaks too loudly for anyone to ignore.


China should pay Ten Trillion Dollars to America, and the World, for the death and destruction they have caused!

Google on Wednesday revealed that it has &#x27;reassigned&#x27; Kamu Bobb, global lead for diversity strategy and research, after a now-deleted 2007 blog post surfaced written following an outbreak of violence between Lebanon and Israel that year.


Titled &quot;If I Were a Jew,&quot; Bobb wrote: &quot;If I were a Jew I would be concerned about my insatiable appetite for war and killing in defense of myself.&quot;


&quot;Self-defense is undoubtedly an instinct, but I would be afraid of my increasing insensitivity to the suffering [of] others,&quot; he added.

                    <span>Dangerous Heatwave Heads For Northeast This Weekend 

            
A dangerous heatwave plagues much of the Western US this week as scorching heat pushes towards the east through the weekend and into early next week. 


Heat warnings and advisories are in effect from the California/Mexico border to Washington state, where temperatures anomalies are 30 degrees above normal in some areas. 


&quot;Extreme heat in these locations will significantly increase the potential for heat-related illnesses,&quot; the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) warned. 


&quot;Additionally, much of the Southwest and West is experiencing severe to exceptional drought conditions, which will undoubtedly be exacerbated by the current heatwave,&quot; added WPC.

By Vince Bielski, RealClearInvestigations


President Biden repeatedly insists that his infrastructure plan will create millions of jobs and labor unions will be the big winners. But interviews with economists, union leaders, government officials and trade groups as well as basic math suggest otherwise.


The once dominant trade and construction unions no longer have enough members outside of their strongholds on both coasts and in the Midwest to claim most of the projected infrastructure jobs. By some estimates, two-thirds of these jobs will go to nonunion workers who dominate the construction markets in most states.


Biden, in short, appears to be harking back nostalgically to an era of union…</span>

Since its inception in March of 2016, the Babylon Bee has made a name for itself as the most hilarious satire website in the known universe - cranking out headlines that would fool only the most abject of morons with no inner monologue, while making the rest of us spit coffee all over our screens.

As the site has risen in popularity (with an estimated 5 million visits per month), liberal &#x27;fact checkers&#x27; began smearing the Bee by fact checking obvious satire.

Pouring more fuel on what was already today&#x27;s dumpster fire of a market, Bloomberg reported that according to a memo it had seen, Jefferies told clients its prime brokerage arm will no longer allow the execution of short sells in meme stocks such as AMC, GameStop and MicroVision.


“Until further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options in GME, AMC and MVIS,” the memo noted. The firm will no longer allow the execution of short sells of those securities, the memo continued, noting that other stocks may be added to that list.


The news comes in a rollercoaster session for AMC which after plunging as much as 30% on news it was selling 11.55MM shares in an At The Market offering, reversed all losses after announcing it had completed the offering, gaining as much as 10% before again reversing the move and last seen down about 9% at $57. Expect much more drama here.

By Greg Miller of American Shipper,


In a sign of just how frenzied the container market has become, a freight forwarder is reportedly paying $135,000 per day for a short-term charter of the S Santiago, a 15-year-old container ship with a capacity of 5,060 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).



“Charter rates for short employment … have gone out of control,” said Alphaliner in its new weekly report.



“Depending on the sources, the ship would have obtained anything between $100,000 and $145,000 per day, an absolute historic high. The name of the charterer has not been fully confirmed, although it is believed to be a forwarder.”

Fox News&#x27; Tucker Carlson ripped &quot;the utter fraudulence of Tony Fauci&quot; Wednesday night, after BuzzFeed and the Washington Post obtained thousands of pages of emails through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, revealing that the nation&#x27;s top virologist was telling the public one thing, while furiously working on damage control and narrative-shaping as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded.







According to Carlson, Americans assumed &quot;that the man in charge of protecting the US from COVID must be rational and impressive,&quot; adding &quot;We also assumed he must be honest. But we were wrong.

                    <span>New York City Paid 114,000 Highly-Compensated Public Employees Earning $100,000+

            
Authored by Adam Andrzejewski via RealClear Policy (emphasis ours),


New York City had more than 114,000 municipal workers earning $100,000 or more in 2019. That is up sharply from 76,166 employees with pay exceeding $100,000 in 2016.







Data comes a year before the pandemic hit and is the latest year available.


These were not just high-level employees like agency commissioners or deputy mayors. NYC employees included thermostat repairmen making up to $198,630; regular laborers hauling away $213,169; electricians taking home $253,132; and plumbers pocketing up to $286,245.


The cost of benefits would be additional and is not included in these figures.


These large paychecks are only sustainable because Congress bailed out New York City for $4.3 billion in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The federal bailout more than covered the overstated deficits of the city.


City officials estimated a $5.5 billion gap, but actual revenues came in $2.7 billion higher. Using $1.2 billion from reserves, and finding $1 billion in unspecified labor savings, among other things closed the budget gap.


Therefore, the federal money now exists for extra spending.


In December, Fitch Ratings downgraded New York City’s bond rating and issued a negative outlook. That was after Moody’s Investors Service lowered the credit ratings of both the state and city in October.

I’ve been learning as much as I can about the new UFO narrative the political/media class have been pushing in conjunction with the US military to prepare for the Senate report that’s due to be released this month.


One of the disconcerting things I’ve been seeing again and again from all the major players in this new narrative like Lue Elizondo and Christopher Mellon is the absurd assertion that not only is it entirely possible that the unknown phenomena allegedly being regularly witnessed by military personnel are extraterrestrial in origin, but that if they are extraterrestrial they may want to hurt us.

Landlords across the country, the least-pitied group of Americans, were handed a loss on Wednesday after  a federal appeals court in Washington DC denied a request to resume evictions amid a contentious dispute over a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) moratorium during the pandemic.







To recap, last month US District Judge Dabney Friedrich struck down the CDC moratorium on evictions, finding that the agency had overstepped its authority - yet agreeing to block her own ruling from taking immediate affect in order for the Biden administration to launch an appeal, according to The Hill.


In response, the plaintiffs - which includes the Alabama Association of Realtors and several co-plaintiffs - aske…</span>

                    <span>Biden &amp; &#x27;The 1-Percent&#x27;

            
Authored by Andy Puzder via RealClearPolitics.com, 


In a speech last week introducing his proposed $6 trillion 2022 budget, President Biden claimed that the benefits of the Republican Party’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act “went to the wealthiest 1% of America.”


It’s not the first time he’s made this claim.


In his first speech to a joint session of Congress, Biden described the TCJA as a “huge windfall” for “those at the very top.” 


To right that wrong, he proposes getting rid of loopholes and raising the top tax rate from its current 37% to 39.6%.


Why? So that “the wealthiest 1% of Americans” will “pay their fair share,” a phrase that the president and his fellow Democrats repeat with abandon.

                    <span>SoftBank-Backed Construction-Industry-&quot;Transforming&quot; Company Katerra Collapses After Billions In Investment

            
Oh how the mighty continue to fall.


Katerra, the construction giant that was backed by SoftBank, has officially told its employees that it is shutting down its operations. Katerra “had promised to shake up the construction industry with its efficient factories, prefab parts and modular construction units,” Bloomberg had reported on the company in the past.


But now the only thing it&#x27;s shaking up are the lives of the 8,000 employees it had globally, as of last year, according to TechCrunch, who pointed out that the company had already struggled &quot;to find a viable business in cheaply building properties for real estate developers&quot;.


The company was then beset by climbing labor and material costs associated with the pandemic (and perhaps now, the hyperinflation that&#x27;s succeeding the pandemic). 


&quot;So, you guys use a lot of lumber, or no?&quot;


SoftBank tried to bail out the struggling company, offering $200 million on top of the billions it had already invested in the company, to buy a majority stake. But, not unlike the WeWork IPO, Katerra couldn&#x27;t be saved. 


Bloomberg reports that the company is now likely going to walk away from &quot;dozens&quot; of projects it has already committed to. 


Among those being laid off are 117 workers in Seattle, according to The Seattle Times. The losses are expected to take effect on June 4. 


CEO Masayoshi Son had called Katerra one of his &quot;regrets&quot; in an interview with Barron&#x27;s last month. The company had raised more than $2 billion since its founding in 2015.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


A report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned that a recent labor shortage plaguing businesses nationwide is worsening, describing the situation as a “national economic crisis.”







The Chamber’s report released Tuesday found that the United States had a record 8.1 million vacant job openings in March—the last month where data was available—noting it was an increase of 600,000 from February.


But, the Chamber stressed that there “are approximately half as many available workers for every open job,” or 1.4 available workers per job opening, across the country “and the ratio continues to fall.” Compared with the previous 20 years, the…</span>

Authored by Mike Shedlock via MishTalk.com,


How big is Biden&#x27;s $6 trillion budget and what are the admitted implications?







That seemingly simple question is the subject of a scathing attack on Biden by the Washington Post.


WaPo Columnist Marc A. Thiessen says Biden’s Budget is a Lie.



Q: How big a lie? 

A: Another $5.8 trillion.



Thiessen calculates that by adding up all of Biden&#x27;s campaign promises and items in the budget that are not reasonable estimates.

It&#x27;s official: just before midnight local time Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid of Yesh Atid party notified President Reuven Rivlin that he&#x27;s successfully formed a power-sharing government, which means the country&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is out.


The 71-year-old Netanyahu has long been dubbed &quot;the magician&quot; by supporters for his history of being able to politically survive time and again against multiple near-misses. But as Axios notes, &quot;But he&#x27;s not out quite yet&quot; - and there&#x27;s still time to wreak havoc on Iran in a desperate bid to cancel the nuclear deal with world powers.

                    <span>Israel&#x27;s New Mossad Chief Threatens More Assassinations &amp; Attacks Inside Iran

            
Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


On Tuesday, the new head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency suggested more Israeli covert attacks and assassinations inside Iran should be expected even as the US and other world powers are negotiating a revival of the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA.


&quot;The Iranian program will continue feeling Mossad’s might. We are well acquainted with the nuclear program and its various components, we know personally the factors that operate in it and also the forces that drive them,&quot; David Barnea said at his swearing-in ceremony, as quoted by Israel’s Ynet.







Barnea said the JCPOA negotiations show that Israel might have to act alone against Iran. &quot;The agree…</span>

                    <span>Step Aside AMC: Here Are The Most Shorted Stocks Right Now

            
Four months after the Reddit crew sparked a historic market-wide short squeeze across a handful of small and mid-cap companies, which knocked out some of the most respected hedge funds in the world with Melvin Capital requiring a multi-billion bailout from Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen, the squeeze is back sending heavily shorted names like AMC, whose short interest we pointed out last week was off the charts...

... and which has exploded higher, a squeeze which has now shifted over to names such as Bed Bath and Beyond and various other small and mid-cap names.







Of course, there is no mystery what&#x27;s behind this: just like in late January when the meme squeeze phenomenon first emerged, the common theme here is that all these stocks are extremely heavily shorted, and retail investors are seeking to squeeze the shorts once again and thus time with even more stimmy power.


To be sure, one look at the chart of the most heavily shorted names shows what&#x27;s going on.







So, just like in late January, we have compiled a list of the most heavily shorted names. It may come as a surprise to some that the former leaders here, GME and AMC are not even in the top 30.


So which companies are? Below we have screened for the most shorted Russell 2000 names (based on SI as a % of float), and which we will use to constitute our latest and greatest short basket.







If the performance of our previous most shorted index is any indication, going long a market cap-weighted basket of these names - and especially the smaller, less liquid ones - could turn out to be the trade of the year, if not a lifetime.

We have a pretty good idea of what&#x27;s behind the latest reddit meltup.


Unlike the March and April, when hedge funds remained largely inert on a net basis, still smarting from the bruising their short books suffered during the January and February meme stock meltups, May saw a renewed push to short beaten down names, with Goldman&#x27;s Prime Brokerage reporting that its book was net sold for a second straight month, driven by short sales outpacing long buys 1.3 to 1.


According to GS Prime, trading flows in Single Names remained especially active both long and short, and made up approx. 85% of the global gross activity, the balance going to ETFs. That said, while macro products (Index and…</span>

&quot;China Joe&quot; Biden has entered the chat.


President Biden is preparing to amend a sweeping US ban on trading with Chinese firms with connections to the PLA, China&#x27;s military, after the policy, initially proposed by President Trump, was challenged in court.


According to Bloomberg, under Biden’s amended order, the Treasury Department will create a list of companies that could face financial penalties for their connection to China’s defense and surveillance technology sectors, the people said.  Previously, the nature of the financial sanctions and the specific companies targeted were set via a Congressionally mandated report from the Pentagon.

The Fed’s first-ever foray into directly bailing out the corporate bond market will apparently come to a final close in the next few months (they hope).







The vehicle, known as the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, or SMCCF, holds about $13.7 billion in already-outstanding corporate bonds.


The SMCCF ceased operations on December 31, 2020.


$5.21 billion of bonds from individual companies including Whirlpool, Walmart, and Visa (as of April 30, 2021, 45 bonds matured, 112 had been redeemed early, and 1,204 bonds remain outstanding in the SMCCF).

                    <span>Oil Algos Confused After Big Crude Draw, Product Build

            
Oil prices rallied on the day as signs of a demand recovery from the US to Europe stoke optimism among producers and analysts in the crude market, combined with waning hopes for an Iran nuke deal.


Oil is in “strong demand right now,” with economies around the world opening up, Daniel Yergin, the oil historian and vice chairman at consultant IHS Markit Ltd., said in a Bloomberg Television interview.



&quot;Oil is bid on the Iran timeline to adding barrels getting kicked further into the future--sometime between August and the fall,&quot; says Bob Yawger at Mizuho.



After last week&#x27;s across-the-board draws, analysts expected another week of demand dominance.

While crude stocks tumbled more than expected, gasoline and distillate stocks unexpectedly rose last week...

WTI hovered just below $68.80 ahead of the API print and barely budged on the mixed data...







“There’s plenty of room for upside here,” said Bob Yawger, head of the futures division at Mizuho Securities.


“Summer and the reopening of the economy is bullish for demand,” while “it looks much less likely we’ll have Iranian barrels any time soon than it did last week.”


But, the question now is whether oil prices can hold their gains &quot;amid strong demand, despite plenty of downside risk on the supply side,&quot; said Robbie Fraser, global research &amp; analytics manager at Schneider Electric, in a daily report.

The Department of Homeland Security on Friday issued a new warning bulletin, alerting Americans that domestic extremists may well use violence on the 100th Anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre. This was at least the fourth such bulletin issued this year by Homeland Security (DHS) warning of the same danger and, thus far, none of the fears it is trying to instill into the American population has materialized.

According to every career economist, market strategist and Fed lackey, inflation is transitory. The most important man on Wall Street disagrees.


Speaking at a virtual event hosted by Deutsche Bank, Blackrock CEO Larry Fink who manages more money than the Fed (over $9 trillion at last check) countered soothing talk that soaring prices are here and gone tomorrow, and said that investors may be underestimating the potential for a spike in inflation.



&quot;Most people haven’t had a forty-plus year career, and they’ve only seen declining inflation over the last 30-plus years. So this is going to be a pretty big shock&quot;, Fink said, his warning falling on deaf ears.

Authored by Daniel Lacalle,


The first thing any economist should do wen reading a budget proposal is to analyse the basic macro assumptions and the results presented by the administration. When both are poor, the budget should be criticised. This is the case of the Biden Budget Plan.







Same growth, a lot more debt and less employment.


According to the administration, the impact on growth of this budget will be negligible, as their own -and optimistic- estimates see no change in the slowdown of the U.S. economic growth trend.

Authored by Jamie Joseph via The Epoch Times,


Los Angeles is set ablaze up to 24 times a day. The cause? Thousands of homeless encampments...







This year, fires started in homeless encampments have accounted for 54 percent of the blazes battled by the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), according to officials—a sharp uptick compared to 2020.


As the county grapples with more than 66,000 people living on its streets, critics are pointing to the growing number of fires caused by the homeless as another indication that officials are mishandling the crisis. And in parts of the city where the homeless are concentrated, residents and business owners say their concerns are not being heard.

                    <span>Nuclear Flashcards On Learning Apps Expose US Military Secrets

            
U.S. troops tasked with guarding nuclear bombs in Europe accidentally leaked highly sensitive information about these weapons on popular educational websites, according to Bellingcat.


Military personnel used popular learning websites such as Quizlet, Chegg Prep, and Cram to remember complex security protocols, exact locations, and other top-secret information. 


So how did Bellingcat&#x27;s Foeke Postma uncover the leaked documents? Well, a simple search on the study websites revealed various sets of flashcards. 



&quot;By simply searching online for terms publicly known to be associated with nuclear weapons, Bellingcat was able to discover cards used by military personnel serving at all six European military …</span>

Authored by Lawrence Kadish via The Gatestone Institute,


One suspects that historians and economists will consistently agree on one irrefutable fact: nations that allow their economies to bathe in red ink are destined to fail. This failure takes many roads and differs in timing, but massive, uncontrolled national deficits eventually reduce a nation state to being a pauper, a pariah -- and pathetic.


Enter Joe Biden&#x27;s &quot;American Jobs Plan,&quot; a $2.3 trillion spending scheme that takes some Americans&#x27; most fevered fantasies and wraps them inside an &quot;infrastructure&quot; label in an effort to convince Capitol Hill that the spending is all about roads and bridges.

After receiving more than 75,000 individual complaints that it&#x27;s Alex-powered Echo devices were spying on them, Amazon has abandoned its policy that such complaints must be resolved outside the court system via secretive arbitration proceedings, and will instead allow customers to file lawsuits, according to the Wall Street Journal.


In other words, &#x27;so sue us.&#x27;







The company quietly changed its terms of service to file lawsuits, as the company already faces at least three class action suits - including one brought May 18 alleging that the company&#x27;s Echo devices were recording people without permission. 



The retail giant made the change after plaintiffs’ lawyers flooded Amazon wit…</span>

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


A man in eastern China contracted what appears to be the first human case of H10N3, a type of avian influenza, according to Chinese regime officials.







The 41-year-old man, who was not named, was hospitalized in late April with H10N3 in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, located near Shanghai, according to China’s National Health Commission in a statement on its website.


The commission said that no other cases have been reported.



“This infection is an accidental cross-species transmission,” its statement said, while also claiming that “the risk of large-scale transmission is low,” according to a Chinese-to-English translation.

                    <span>Biden Waives FBI Background Checks For Caregivers At Child Migrant Facilities

            
The Biden administration has scrapped FBI background checks for caregivers at its overpacked child migrant shelters (or as AOC no longer calls them, &#x27;concentration camps&#x27;), alarming child welfare experts who say this compromises safety, according to the Chicago Tribune.







The move comes as Biden turns to &quot;tent camps, convention centers and other huge facilities&quot; which are operated by private contractors paid by the Department of Health and Human Services. In March, the administration announced that it would open eight new emergency sites across the Southwest, which will add 15,000 new beds - doubling capacity.

In January, 2020, when the World Health Organization insisted that COVID-19 wasn&#x27;t transmissible between humans, and Dr. Anthony Fauci said that the risk to the American public from the virus was &quot;low,&quot; officials at the National Institutes of Health were scrambling to perform damage control after a controversial - and now withdrawn - study suggested that there were HIV-like &#x27;insertions&#x27; included in SARS-CoV-2.







The study, &quot;Uncanny similarity of unique inserts on the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag,&quot; posited that segments of the virus&#x27;s RNA had no relation to other coronaviruses such as SARS, and instead appeared to be closer to HIV.

You probably don’t need me to tell you that society is coming apart at the seams all around us.  If you live in a major city, you can just walk outside and watch it happen right in front of you.  Prior to 2020, social decay was steadily eating away at our society, but once the pandemic hit many of our societal problems greatly accelerated.  Even while the Federal Reserve was making sure that wealthy Wall Street investors were being taken care of well, poverty and homelessness were absolutely exploding in major cities all over the nation.  Meanwhile, an increasing number of Americans have been turning to drugs to cope with thei…</span>

Update (2002 ET): The USDA has released an important update about the Biden administration&#x27;s steps to mitigate potential supply constraints and price surges following JBS&#x27; ransomware attack. 



As noted earlier today by the White House, USDA is aware of the ransomware attack against JBS, which is affecting the company&#x27;s operations, including its facilities in the United States. USDA continues to work closely with the White House, Department of Homeland Security, JBS USA and others to monitor this situation closely and offer help and assistance to mitigate any potential supply or price issues. As part of that effort, USDA has reached out to several major meat processors in the United States to …</span>

Longtime &#x27;bond king&#x27; Bill Gross has kept a low profile since his &quot;retirement&quot; from Janus Henderson, where he worked after leaving PIMCO abruptly in 2014 in a high-profile dispute with colleagues. While he emerged earlier this year to share the results of a recent Gamestop short, Gross has been making more appearances in the tabloids than in the business press recently thanks to a legal dispute with one of his neighbors.







But in today&#x27;s FT, Gross returns with an editorial warning that the Federal Reserve and Treasury are injecting money into the economy so quickly that as the economy recovers from COVID-19, they&#x27;re risking a dangerous snap-back in markets as investors reckon with the withdrawal of …</span>

                    <span>Tennessee Will Explore The Possibility Of A State Gold Depository

            
Via SchiffGold.com,


Last month, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed a bill into law that creates a commission to study the feasibility of creating a gold bullion depository in the Volunteer State.







A state bullion depository would not only create a safe place to store precious metals; it would increase the state’s financial independence. It could also facilitate the everyday use of gold and silver in financial transactions in Tennessee and set the stage to undermine the Federal Reserve’s monopoly on money.


Sen. Paul Rose (R) sponsored Senate Bill 279 (SB279) and Rep. Bud Hulsey (R-Kingsport) carried the companion bill in the House — House Bill 353 (HB353). The new law requires the Tennessee advis…</span>

                    <span>Huawei Challenges Google, Apple With New Smartphone Operating System

            
President Biden has decided to maintain President Trump&#x27;s blacklisting of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, cutting it off from key American suppliers and hamstringing its smartphone business, which was, for a brief time, the global leader in sales thanks to its leading position in China, by far the world&#x27;s biggest market. Now, after developing its own proprietary operating system and initially deploying it on laptops and tablets, the company is preparing to launch a mobile version of Harmony OS for smartphones in a bid to take on Google and Apple.

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


The Washington Post has become the latest media outlet to reverse its earlier insistence that the Wuhan lab leak theory was a “debunked conspiracy theory.”







The newspaper published an article in February 2020 by Paulini Firozi labeling the explanation a “debunked conspiracy theory” but has now been forced to issue a retraction.



“Earlier versions of this story and its headline inaccurately characterized comments by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) regarding the origins of the coronavirus,” states the retraction.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


The mothers of several people whose names have been invoked by Black Lives Matter activists panned the group’s co-founder, Patrisse Cullors, for benefitting “off the blood” of their family members.







Cullors last week announced last week that she would be departing the organization, coming after reports disclosed her finances and real estate holdings.



“They are benefiting off the blood of our loved ones, and they won’t even talk to us,” Samaria Rice, the mother of a 12-year-old boy, Tamir Rice, who was shot by police in Cleveland, told the New York Post.

                    <span>SEC Blasted Tesla In May 2020 For Failing To Oversee Musk&#x27;s Tweets

            
In previously undisclosed documents, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, securities regulators told Tesla last year that CEO Elon Musk&#x27;s use of Twitter had twice violated a court-ordered policy requiring his tweets to be preapproved by company lawyers.







In letters sent to Tesla in 2019 and 2020, the SEC reportedly said tweets that Musk wrote about Tesla&#x27;s solar roof production volumes and its stock price hadn&#x27;t undergone the required preapproval by Tesla&#x27;s lawyers.


As a reminder, Musk had publicly mocked the SEC even after settling the previous fraud claims with the agency.







Specifically, The Wall Street Journal reports that the SEC told Tesla in May 2020 that:



the company had failed “to enforce these procedures and controls despite repeated violations by Mr. Musk.”



The letter, signed by a senior SEC official in its San Francisco office, added:



“Tesla has abdicated the duties required of it by the court’s order.”



This perhaps explains why Musk himself was quick to admit in May 2020 that &quot;no&quot;, his twitter remarks were not vetted.


Given the fact that we are just discovering these details now - at least 13 months after they occurred - as far as we can see, nothing at all has been done to either re-enforce the SEC-ordered oversight by Tesla lawyers, or to slow Musk&#x27;s roll in tweeting frequency and absurdity (cough Dogecoin cough)...



Is the SEC going to - wait for it - tell Tesla to preclear Musk&#x27;s tweets (again)?

...we can only imagine how long it will be before some actual actions are taken... or enforcements hardened over the carmaker&#x27;s incessant need to &#x27;share&#x27;.

By now, even the shoeshine boy knows that central banks are one-print trick pony farcical joke, one which is exposed not just by cryptos which have emerged as a clear alternative to fiat currencies, but by central banks themselves who are adopting their own digital currencies knowing well that the days of traditional paper money are numbered.


And yet within the giant Venn Diagram of the &quot;big farce&quot;, there is a smaller Venn Diagram, which is basically everything and anything Turkey-related, and whose farcical content is exponentially more concentrated because while central banks have become the laughing stock of the financial world in its twilight days before the upcoming grea…</span>

Amazon Sidewalk, the company&#x27;s new shared mesh network that helps devices like Amazon Echo devices, Ring Security Cams, outdoor lights, motion sensors, and Tile trackers work better around the house and beyond, will be switched on next week. Tens of millions of Americans own Amazon devices, and the experimental network will turn users into guinea pigs next week, according to ArsTechnica.


On June 8, users who don&#x27;t opt-out will be automatically enrolled in &quot;Sidewalk.&quot; The mesh network, created by Echoes, cameras, and other smart devices under the Amazon brand, will use a small amount of bandwidth and broadcast to nearby neighbors and or city streets.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


More than 100 employees at Houston Methodist Hospital filed a lawsuit against their employer for requiring all staff members to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in order to keep their jobs.







Saying the COVID-19 vaccines are experimental and they don’t want to be “guinea pigs,” the 117 employees argued in court that it’s unlawful for their employers to require them to take the shots.



“Methodist Hospital is forcing its employees to be human ‘guinea pigs’ as a condition for continued employment,” their lawsuit (pdf) states. They wrote that the hospital’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate “requires the employee to subject themselves to medical…</span>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who increasingly looks to be on his way out of power, said on Tuesday that&#x27;s he&#x27;s willing to worsen relations with the US under the Biden administration if it means preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.


&quot;An Iranian nuclear bomb is a threat for the continuation of the Zionist project and we must fight it relentlessly,&quot; he said at a ceremony on the occasion of Israel&#x27;s new Mossad chief David Barnea taking the helm. &quot;If we have to choose between friction with our great friend the U.S. and the elimination of this existential threat, the elimination of the threat will come first,&quot; Netanyahu asserted.

“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. …We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. …In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or busines…</span>

Once upon a time, not that long ago, the biggest outrage in the world of politics was the &quot;shocking&quot; revelation made possible by Edward Snowden&#x27;s exposure of the NSA&#x27;s deep state operations, that the Obama administration had a penchant for spying... on everyone, and especially its top allies such as Angela Merkel who BlackBerry was notorious breached by US spies (yes, even the ultra-partisan outlet CNN covered it &quot;Obama administration spied on German media as well as its government&quot;).


Of course, the outrage eventually died down with nothing changing - after all, the US deep state can and will spy on anyone and everyone it chooses, and it&#x27;s not like the president has any control over it, …</span>

                    <span>WHO Switches To Greek Letters To Name Most Dangerous COVID Mutants

            
In a decision that echos the WHO&#x27;s decision back in early 2020 to rename the novel coronavirus to &quot;COVID-19&quot;, the agency has decided to change the names of the most prominent mutant strains of the coronavirus to letters from the Greek alphabet.







Using letters like Alpha, Beta and Gamma (instead of B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) to refer to the variants will make it &quot;easier and more practical&quot; to discuss them with non-scientific audiences, the WHO said in a statement. COVID strains believed to be more infectious are deemed &quot;of interest&quot; and &quot;of concern&quot; by the WHO. 



&quot;While they have their advantages, these scientific names can be difficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting,&quot; the WHO …</span>

                    <span>A Margin Story: Fast Economic Growth Without Profits

            
By Joe Carson, former chief economist at Alliance Bernstein


In Q1 2021, the US economy registered double-digit annualized growth in nominal GDP, a rare occurrence. Yet, an even more rare event is that corporate operating profits did not increase in the quarter when GDP growth increased double-digits.


How can companies&#x27; operating earnings be flat when nominal growth is booming? How does the GDP measure of operating square with S&amp;P 500 firms reporting substantial gains in Q1, far exceeding analysts&#x27; estimates?


GDP Growth &amp; Operating Profits


The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported that nominal GDP increased at an annual rate of 11% in Q1 2021. Since the Reagan boom of the early 1980s, the US only regis…</span>

                    <span>Iran Warns Against &quot;Miscalculations&quot; As US Military Monitors Pair Of Venezuela-Bound Warships

            
In a seeming repeat of the Trump admin attempt to impose a full naval blockade on Venezuela to prevent fuel and oil imports and exports, especially involving Iranian tankers, the US military is said to be actively monitoring two Iranian naval vessels which are believed headed toward Venezuela.


Washington has reportedly warned the Maduro government against receiving the warships, which likely have elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force members aboard. The two &quot;rogue states&quot; (as the US sees them) have become increasingly close especially under the prior four Trump years as they cooperated in circumventing US sanctions, and have grown militarily more cooperative.

After Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) attempted to combat cartels through peaceful means - namely his &quot;hugs, not bullets&quot; campaign to appease criminal organizations, the notoriously violent Jalisco cartel responded by kidnapping several members of an elite police force in the state of Guanajuato, torturing them to obtain the names and addresses of other cops, and is now hunting them down and killing them at their own homes, &quot;on their days off, in front of their families,&quot; according to the Associated Press.

                    <span>Melbourne Lockdown May Be Extended As Latest COVID Cluster Rises To 51

            
Australia and New Zealand have managed to keep COVID cases and deaths at a minimum thanks largely to their isolated status, which has enabled both countries to &quot;raise the drawbridge&quot;, so to speak, keeping out most foreigners since the start of the crisis.







But even with Australia&#x27;s notoriously stringent COVID-19 restrictions, a few cases have managed to slip by. In the face of the biggest cluster uncovered in months, Melbourne and the surrounding Victoria State entered their 4th lockdown last week. Though it was only supposed to last a week, that could soon change as more cases are confirmed.

Three weeks before China admitted that a mysterious virus was circulating in the city of Wuhan, a 61-year-old woman who lived about a mile from several bat research facility was known as &quot;Patient Su&quot; at a local hospital, according to the Daily Mail.


Her identity was accidentally revealed after a leading Chinese official sent a screen-grab to a medical journal which partially revealed personal information, including the fact that she was admitted to the Rongjun Hospital in Wuhan, and &quot;almost certainly lived in the Kaile Guiyan community on Zhuodaoquan Street, about 600 metres from the medical centre.&quot;

The border crossing in Laredo, Texas


U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is tasked with assessing all commercial or pedestrian traffic entering the United States by airplane, overland vehicle, ship or on foot. However, in Mexico, about 10 different organizations are tasked with implementing customs clearance, issuing permits and certificates of imports/exports and protecting the border, including the Mexican army, the Guardia Nacional and the federal Tax Administration Service (SAT).

Brace for more pessimistic news about the global semiconductor shortage...


Intel is now going on the record and doubling down on statements that its CEO made on 60 Minutes earlier this year, stating that it could take &quot;several years&quot; for the current supply shortage of semiconductors to be resolved. 


CEO Pat Gelsinger said that the pandemic-inspired &quot;work from home&quot; trend caused a &quot;cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors&quot;, according to Reuters. 


&quot;But while the industry has taken steps to address near term constraints it could still take a couple of years for the ecosystem to address shortages of foundry capacity, substrates and components,&quot; Gelsinger commented.

Authored by Isabel van Brugen via The Epoch Times,


Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the lead Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Sunday said it was “more likely than not” that COVID-19 originated from a lab accident, calling it the “worst cover-up in human history.”



“I do think it’s more likely than not it emerged out of the lab, most likely accidentally,” McCaul said during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.”


“Let me say, this is the worst cover-up in human history that we’ve seen resulting in 3.5 million deaths, creating economic devastation around the globe.”

It&#x27;s not like we didn&#x27;t tell you so... 


The introduction of COVID status certificates is creating a two-tier society whereby vaxxed people enjoy their full rights and other perks, and non-vaxxed are heavily penalized.  


The latest example is in Florida, where a concert promoter for a future rock show this summer in Tampa Bay charges $18 per ticket for vaxxed fans and $999.99 for non-vaxxed fans, according to Tampa ABC affiliate WFTS. 



&quot;To be eligible for the DISCOUNT, you will need to bring a government-issued photo ID and your PHYSICAL COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card (if you have lost it keep reading, we got you). You will need to have had your second shot of Pfizer or Moderna, or …</span>

                    <span>Memorial Day: Remember Political Lies That Caused Soldiers To Die

            
Authored by James Bovard via JimBovard.com,


On Memorial Day, the media do their usual sacralizing of war. Instead, it should be a day for the ritualized scourging of politicians.


During the last 70 years, their lies have resulted in the unnecessary deaths of almost 100,000 American soldiers and millions of foreigners. And yet, people still get teary-eyed when politicians take the stage to talk about their devotion to the troops.







On Memorial Day 2011, for instance, the Washington Post included numerous touching photographs of graves, recent widows or fatherless kids by the headstones, and stories of the troops’ sacrifices. The Post buried a short article in the middle of the A-Section (squee…</span>

                    <span>Michael Flynn Says Myanmar-Style Military Coup &#x27;Should Happen&#x27; In United States

            
Former Trump National Security Adviser Micheal Flynn made an off-the-cuff statement over the weekend that a Myanmar-like military coup not only could happen, but &quot;should happen&quot; in the US.







Speaking at the Dallas &quot;For God &amp; Country Patriot Roundup,&quot; branded by Business Insider and MarketWatch as a &quot;QAnon conference&quot; (because a quilt with a &quot;Q&quot; on it was auctioned off at the event), Flynn was asked during a Q&amp;A session &quot;I want to know why what happened in Myanmar can’t happen here?&quot;


To which Flynn - who spent 33 years as an Army intelligence officer - replied: &quot;No reason. I mean, it should happen.&quot;

After it was revealed that the FBI pressured Flynn into pleading guilty amid threat of going after his son, leading the DOJ to drop its case against him (which a judge finally closed eight months later), Flynn has become an icon among former President Trump&#x27;s most ardent supporters.


According to the New York Times, &quot;He was one of the most extreme voices in Mr. Trump’s 77-day push to overturn the election,&quot; and suggested using the military to rerun the vote in key battleground states - which then-President Trump could have imposed martial law to enact.


&quot;People out there talk about martial law like it’s something that we’ve never done,&quot; Flynn told Newsmax several months ago, noting that the military had taken over for civilian authorities dozens of times in US history.

The Elephant in the Room


Since we now know the extreme monetary policy implemented by the Americans is actually less extreme when compared to the Japanese, the Europeans, the Chinese, the Canadians and others, then there must be something else happening to create all of this (nonsensical) drama about the US Dollar being on the verge of collapsing.


And this is where the reflation trade comes into play. Monetary theorists have always proclaimed that if you produce excessive stimulus via interest rate cuts, balance sheet expansion and especially when combined with excessive stimulus, then inflation is going t…</span>

                    <span>China Orders First Lockdown Since January As Indian Mutant Discovered In Guangzhou

            
India&#x27;s second coronavirus wave finally crested during the month of May as the 7-day average declined steadily over the course of the month, while deaths remained stubbornly high until the second half. But even more than the numbers, the spread of a mutated COVID strain first discovered in India, a strain tagged with the handle B.1.617, has raised alarm as it spread around the world.







And now China is reacting to evidence of a recent cluster of cases caused by the Indian variant to further tighten China&#x27;s border between India and their mutual neighbors.

Moscow had some stinging words for Washington which were also hilariously ironic on Monday, as both Putin and Biden look ahead to their in-person summit set for June 16 in Geneva. Warning of &quot;uncomfortable&quot; signals to come, the Kremlin indicated that high on the agenda would be a range of human rights and free speech issues in the United States, particularly the &quot;persecution&quot; of those behind the January 6 Capitol riot by the Biden administration.

Local newspaper Yomiuri reveals Japanese authorities are mulling over expanding eligibility criteria, including a negative COVID-19 test or vaccination history, for fans before entering the Tokyo Olympics this summer. Once inside, spectators might be forbidden from eating, drinking, and cheering. 


Yomiuri said the government is considering that all spectators be required to show a negative COVID test within a week before attending the event that is set to run between July 23 and Aug. 8. 







Reuters quoted the government&#x27;s top spokesman Katsunobu Kato, who told reporters that he&#x27;s unaware of any decision on eligibility criteria.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Below is my column in the Hill newspaper on the announcement that the University of California will now join the “test-blind” movement and end the use of the SAT and ACT in its admissions decisions. Some have called for the change to increase diversity in the schools, particularly after California voters refused to change the long ban on affirmative action in education under state law.

Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has brought up a very interesting point regarding China&#x27;s unwillingness to share evidence with western investigators looking into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.


During a Sunday appearance on CBS News &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; Gottlieb noted that CCP scientists would have taken blood samples from three lab workers who were hospitalized with COVID-like symptoms in Dec. 2019 (one of whom&#x27;s wife likely died of the disease).







When asked if he believes whether the Chinese know where the pandemic came from, Gottlieb replied: &quot;They would know the answer to the question because they would have blood samples from the workers in that lab.&quot;…</span>

Different Types of Competition


With today being the US Memorial Day holiday to commemorate its fallen combat soldiers, it’s likely to be a quiet start to the week for markets. However, the US holiday provides a platform for some sober reflection on more contemporary forms of competition


First, a former PBOC official says the rapid rise in CNY against USD probably won’t last, and that the Chinese currency is “overbought”. That looks a further jaw-boning attempt to shift market expectations away from the idea that Beijing is going to allow CNY to keep appreciating.

The owner of a Mendocino, California restaurant is penalizing customers who wear masks inside, according to NBC Bay Area.



&quot;$5 FEE ADDED TO ORDERS PLACED WHILE WEARING A FACE MASK,&quot; reads signs posted in the windows and at the register of Fiddleheads Cafe.



Fiddleheads Cafe in Mendocino not only discourages wearing masks but also charges a penalty. (May 28, 2021)


The fine print adds that anyone overheard bragging about having been vaccinated will be hit with another $5 charge.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Over the weekend Senator Rand Paul and former CIA director and secretary of state Mike Pompeo both warned that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is still up and running, and that evidence points to involvement with the Chinese military in bioweapons research.







Appearing on Fox News, Paul told Jeanine Pirro that he is worried US funding is still being used by the lab to conduct biological warfare experiments.



“I’m very worried that this stuff still goes on and that the U.S. government’s been funding it,” Paul said, adding “We’ve got a lot of evidence pointing to this lab now,” as the origin of the virus outbreak.

                    <span>&quot;Hostile Policy&quot; To Trigger Arms Race: N.Korea Blasts US Lifting Restrictions On South&#x27;s Missile Program

            
North Korea has blasted what it&#x27;s calling a &quot;hostile policy&quot; in the wake of the Biden White House lifting restrictions on South Korea&#x27;s ballistic missile program, which is now authorized to develop missiles capable of traveling beyond prior limitations. 


During a May 21 US-South Korea summit the US side announced Seoul is now free to pursue missiles with unlimited ranges, but the statement out of a Pyongyang official said this will inevitably lead to an &quot;acute and instable situation&quot;, according to the Associated Press. Previously the US imposed a limit of a 500 mile range (800km) on the south&#x27;s missiles on concerns of a regional arms race.

Authored by James Poplar via AmericanThinker.com,


Often, we forget that Memorial Day  is a day not for merchandise sales and or the unofficial start of Summer.







But rather it is a day set aside to honor those brave men and women who have fallen in the performance of their military duties while serving in the United States armed forces. 


On this solemn day there will be cemeteries all across the nation where loved ones will pay their humble respects and quiet tribute to a father, mother, sister, or brother. The loss may be fresh, or it may only be a distant but still painful memory.

                    <span>In Less Than Two Weeks, Millions Of Americans Will Lose Unemployment Benefits

            
With at least 24 GOP-led states set to end federal unemployment assistance before they&#x27;re set to expire on Sept. 6, million of Americans are going to need to dust off those resumes and start helping reduce the massive job shortage after being paid to stay home for over a year.







The benefits set to lapse include not only the additional $300 weekly federal supplement, but programs for gig workers and others who typically don&#x27;t qualify for aid &quot;(Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, or PUA) and for the long-term unemployed (Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, or PEUC) in most cases,&quot; according to CNBC, which has provided this handy guide to states set to end benefits, and when:

Authored by Mark Hendrickson via The Mises Institute,


To most people, “inflation” signifies widespread rising prices. Economists have long argued, as a matter of technical accuracy, that “inflation” denotes an increasing money supply. Frankly, though, most people don’t care what happens to the supply of money, but they care a lot about the prices they pay, so I’ll focus primarily on the numerous rapidly rising prices Americans are paying today.







Following are several examples of the current inflation:


Corn, soybeans, and wheat have been trading at multi-year highs, with corn having risen from around $3.80 per bushel in January 2020 to approximately $6.75 now. Chicken wings are at all-time record high…</span>

                    <span>Belgium Recalls Ambassador To South Korea After Wife Attacked Workers

            
Belgium has recalled its ambassador to South Korea after his wife allegedly assaulted two employees of a shop in Seoul, an incident that elicited widespread public anger in South Korea.


According to the AP, the Belgian Embassy said Foreign Affairs Minister Sophie Wilmès had decided that it was in the best interest of bilateral relations to terminate Ambassador Peter Lescouhier&#x27;s tenure as Belgium&#x27;s ambassador to Seoul, a position he has held for three years. It&#x27;s been said that he will depart this summer, but an exact date hasn&#x27;t been released.







Although Lescouhier served his country with dedication, “the current situation doesn’t allow him to further carry out his role in a serene way,” the…</span>

Authored by Patricia Tolson via The Epoch Times,


On Monday, May 31, Americans from sea to shining sea will observe Memorial Day. However, veterans are quick to remind you: “It’s not about us.”



“Monday is not about us,” Sergeant J.O. Batten, Commander of VFW Post 8713 in Brooksville, Florida told The Epoch Times.


“It’s about the men on that wall out there. A lot of people don’t realize that.”



Batten, a United States Marine, served in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969.







“The wall” is a granite monument, which stands guard at the front door of VFW. It bears the names of a group of men known as “The Brooksville Eight,” men who were killed in action during the Vietnam War.


They are:

By Vishwanath Tirupattur, global head of Quantitative Research at Morgan Stanley


The title of our recently published mid-year outlook – Now the Hard Part – captures the conundrum market participants face: early-cycle timing, mid-cycle conditions and late-cycle valuations.







It is unusual to see this confluence, especially because it was only a little over a year ago that global risk markets were reeling and recording cyclical lows. Thus, despite our economists&#x27; call for strong global economic growth supported by the largest fiscal stimulus, the largest monetary easing and the highest consumer savings rates in post-war history, the investment recommendations from our strategists have a more subdued tone…</span>

Authored by Ethan Yang via The American Institute for Economic Research,


The internet is having a field day over a seemingly trivial mishap involving actor and wrestler John Cena, who apologized for calling the island nation of Taiwan a country. That is a massive point of issue for the Chinese Communist Party as they continue to claim that Taiwan is part of China. NBC News provides the context by reporting,



“In an interview to Taiwanese broadcaster TVBS earlier this month, Cena sparked controversy while promoting the ninth installment of the Fast &amp; Furious franchise when he said, “Taiwan is the first country to watch Fast and Furious 9.”



Cena later issued an apology by stating,

Silicon Valley elites are obsessed with immortality. They&#x27;re pouring investments into biohacking technologies on their quest for living forever. We don&#x27;t want to spoil their fun, but sometimes we have to, as a new study suggests the upper limit of human mortality is 150 years old. 


Researchers of Gero, a Singapore-based biotech company in collaboration with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York, published new research in the journal of Nature portfolio, showing results between aging and the loss of the ability to recover from stresses. They gathered iPhone and medical data from volunteers in the US and UK to calculate the maximum age of humans.

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday walked back comments made by the agency’s chief, who suggested earlier in the day that the federal government was “taking a very close look” at the idea of requiring vaccine passports to enter or leave the United States.



“Looking ahead to summer, Europe and other countries are going to open up. Could we see vaccine passports to travel internationally either into or out of the U.S.?” an ABC “Good Morning America” host asked Alejandro Mayorkas, head of the DHS.


“We’re taking a very close look at that,” Mayorkas responded.

A search is ongoing for three crew members reported missing from a roll-on/roll-off (ro/ro) vessel that sank off the coast of Japan early Friday morning.  The MV Byakko sank at about 2:40 a.m. local time after colliding with the chemical tanker Ulsan Pioneer just before midnight in the Seto Inland Sea, Reuters reported. The Byakko reportedly sank about 2.5 miles off the coast of Imabari.


Nine of the Byakko’s 12 crew members were said to have been rescued by the Japanese coast guard and nearby ships.

Two GOP lawmakers this week launched a campaign calling on whistleblowers in the military to come forward with their experiences in training programs that promote critical race theory or “diversity, equity, and inclusion.”



“We won’t let our military fall to woke ideology,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), a former Navy SEAL, wrote in a tweet on Friday while linking to a website where informants can submit their accounts.


“With written permission, we will anonymously publish egregious complaints on social media and tell the country what’s happening in our military.”

It&#x27;s the end of an era for Israeli politics as embattled prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country&#x27;s longest serving leader, is facing a shocking ouster after the head of a small hard-line party on Sunday said he would try to form a unity government with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s opponents, effectively ending Bibi&#x27;s 12-year rule.


In a nationwide address, Yamina party leader and Netanyahu&#x27;s former defense minister, Naftali Bennett said he had decided to join forces with the country&#x27;s opposition leader, Yair Lapid in a “unity government&quot; whose &quot;unified&quot; goal has long been removing Netanyahu from office.

                    <span>Fraudsters Go Where The (COVID-19) Money Is

            
Authored by Diane Diamond, op-ed via The Epoch Times,


Last June, eight guys in Brooklyn put their heads together, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, and came up with a scheme to steal strangers’ identities and take what didn’t belong to them.


Just a couple months before that—in the earliest days of the COVID-19 scare—Congress passed a $2.2 trillion bill called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. The money was supposed to go to the millions of isolated Americans who had their paychecks interrupted during the pandemic.


The mooks in Brooklyn had other plans.


This gang of eight, ranging in age from 18 to 25, submitted some $2 million worth of fake unemployment claims for CARES Act assistanc…</span>

Rising wealth in China and the number of millionaires and the middle class is set to increase through the midpoint of this decade as the country grows more affluent and smarter. 


HSBC Holdings Plc&#x27;s new report &quot;The rising wealth of China; Millionaires and the middle class lead the way&quot; predicts a world where millionaires in the country are set to double in the next five years, and the middle class will increase by nearly half. 


From an asset manager&#x27;s point of view, China could be the next hot spot for new clients mainly because the report shows 2 million high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), those with the equivalent of at least $1.55 million in investable assets, are set to more than double …</span>

Authored by Eva Fu via The Epoch Times,


More than 200 House Republicans are putting pressure on their Democrat counterparts to get down to the COVID-19 origins and hold the Chinese regime accountable for the pandemic coverup.



“We request that you instruct the appropriate Democrat committee chairs to immediately join Republican calls to hold the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) accountable for its role in causing the global COVID-19 pandemic,” stated a May 28 letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

A recent report by the United Nations Security Council found that a Turkish-made autonomous drone may have &quot;hunted down and remotely engaged&quot; enemy soldiers loyal to the Libyan General Khalifa Haftar. This bombshell report could be one of the first recorded instances where a terminator-style AI drone engaged and destroyed human targets on its own initiative. 



&quot;Logistics convoys and retreating Haftar Affiliated Forces (HAF) were subsequently hunted down and remotely engaged by the unmanned combat aerial vehicles or the lethal autonomous weapons systems such as the STM Kargu-2 and other loitering munitions,&quot; the UN report reveals.

The gold commitment of traders report is bullish. Let&#x27;s start with a primer of what the COT report shows.







What is the COT Report?


COT reports show the positioning of commodity futures. There is a COT report for every commodity (gold, silver, lean hogs, live cattle, sugar, corn, the S&amp;P 500, US Treasuries, etc.).


The reports are released every Friday but reflect futures positions as of the previous Tuesday.


In the futures world, the net position is always zero. For every long there is a short.


The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CTFC produces two sets of reports described below.

The rocky road between Tesla and the Chinese Communist Party looks like it is continuing.


The automaker is facing &quot;further fallout&quot; in China as some local governments are reviewing Tesla vehicle ownership among their staff, citing the vehicles posing potential security risks, according to Bloomberg. 


Government bodies have been asked to check and report on employees who own Teslas in Zhejiang and Guangxi. Employees are being &quot;forbidden&quot; from driving into certain official areas, due to supposed security risks, the report notes. 


Other official Chinese bodies are following suit. The China Meteorological Administration, for example, has already told its employees not to b…</span>

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


That the era of stability has ended and a new era of increasingly chaotic volatility has begun is not on anyone&#x27;s radar as a possibility.


The standard debate about the future of the economy is: which will we get, high inflation or a deflationary collapse of defaults and asset bubbles popping?


The debate goes round and round in widening circles of complexity as analysts delve into every nuance of the debate.


A recent conversation with my friend A.T. raised a third possibility few seem to consider: increasingly chaotic volatility will be the new normal, as wild swings between inflation and deflation will increase in amplitude and feroci…</span>

                    <span>Gas Is Going To $5 Per Gallon: First In California, Then Across The Country

            
Get ready for $5 per gallon gasoline - especially if you live in California.


At least, that was the contention of a new WSJ op-ed that claims higher taxes and environmental regulations are both driving up the price of gas. 


Author Allysia Finley notes that the average cost at the pump in California is now $4.18 a gallon, pointing out that in 2017, Democrats in the state&#x27;s legislature raised a tax on each gallon by 20.8 cents over three years. 


California drivers are now paying an astonishing average of 63 cents a gallon in state and local taxes, compared an average of 36.8 cents elsewhere in the country. 


The reasoning for the price hike was to repair the state&#x27;s infrastructure, but …</span>

Authored by John Rubino via DollarCollapse.com,


The “Everything Bubble” has jumped from hyperbole to literal truth in just a couple of years, as more and more assets enter “crazy expensive/extremely reckless” territory. The latest addition to the list is collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), which are created when a bank lends money to a less-than-creditworthy company and then bundles that loan with a bunch of similar loans into bonds for sale to yield-starved pension funds and bond funds.


There’s a legitimate place in the market for this kind of security, as long as everyone understands the risks. But in financial bubbles, banks’ insatiable hunger for fees combines with bond buyers’ desperate need for income to cloud everyone’s jud…</span>

Wholesaling real estate is the process of finding a deeply discounted home and passing it along to an end investor. Bearing fast cash, wholesalers are flooding low-income neighborhoods, seeking distressed homeowners who want to sell quickly. Record low mortgage rates, low housing inventory, and a real estate frenzy have increased the amount of wholesaling conducted nationwide since the pandemic as many were lured in by YouTube tutorials. 


The entire strategy behind wholesaling is finding a discounted property, get it under contract, and then flip it to an interested buyer for a quick profit. Bloomberg reports some wholesalers are using strong-arm tactics and misinformation to force sales. Wholesaling…</span>

Davos really do think they are too clever by half. Despite prognostications to the contrary, negotiations with Iran over a new JCPOA are nearing completion which Biden/Obama will sign off on after putting up a bit more token resistance to lifting sanctions.


Why do I say this? Nordstream 2.


Biden backed down on Nordstream 2 and, at The Davos Crowd’s insistence, he will back down on the JCPOA.







Davos needs cheap energy into Europe. That’s ultimately what the JCPOA was all about. The basic framework for the deal is still there. While the U.S. will kick and scream a bit about sanctions relief, Iran will be back into the oil market and make it possible for Europe to on…</span>

                    <span>US Military Plans To Harvest Solar Energy In Space, Beam It To Earth

            
The US Air Force (USAF) is experimenting with the idea to harvest space solar power that will be beamed back to Earth as usable energy. 


The US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) shared a video on YouTube describing how the solar power satellite Arachne would work. 







AFRL Director Brig. Gen. Heather Pringle, quoted by Breaking Defense, said the critical design review of Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research Project (SSPIDR) would be conducted this summer. 


SSPIDR aims to use an Arachne satellite that would convert energy generated from the sun to radio frequency and beam it down to a land-based antenna. Once the radio frequency hits the antenna, it will be converted to useable power. 


If SSPIDR is successful, it could one day give the US military a great advantage on the modern battlefield and an unlimited source of energy for forward operating bases. This will also allow for bases to power future weapons, such as lasers and rail guns. 


At the moment, the military requires massive supply chains and convoys to receive not just energy power generation equipment but also fuel to power generators at remote bases. 


&quot;Ensuring that a forward operating base maintains reliable power is one of the most dangerous parts of military ground operations. Convoys and supply lines are a major target for adversaries,&quot; the narrator of a new AFRL video said. 





Well, this appears to be one way the military is attempting to &quot;go green.&quot;

Ransomware has seeped into the mainstream consciousness thanks to the recent shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline. Crippled by a ransomware attack, Colonial ended up paying a $4.4 million ransom in bitcoins to free itself from its attackers. In the meantime, the U.S. Eastern Seaboard suffered from gasoline shortages.







What is ransomware? It is malicious software that takes control of a computer, say, by encrypting files or threatening to publicly expose data. The ransomware operator only releases that control after receiving a ransom payment, usually Bitcoin but sometimes Monero.

Capping off a week wherein both Belarus and its powerful ally Russia are once again in a diplomatic and sanctions battle with the EU, this time involving flight paths being blocked following last Sunday&#x27;s Ryanair forced diversion incident, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko in Sochi.


Putin reportedly welcomed Lukashenko to the Friday meeting with the remarks: &quot;Thank you for coming here, as we agreed even before the current outburst of emotions,&quot; He emphasized further, &quot;Yes, it is an outburst of emotions,&quot; before saying, &quot;But we have topics to discuss without these developments.&quot;

Market Review &amp; Update


Finally, after a week of false starts, the “buy signals” kicked in, and the markets mustered a rally. As we stated last week:



“With markets deeply oversold on a short-term basis and with signals at levels that generally precede short-term rallies, the rally on Thursday and Friday was not unexpected. Notably, the S&amp;P 500 held support at the 50-dma and rallied back into the previous trading range. 


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq triggered its short-term “buy signal,” which will likely provide some relative outperformance over the S&amp;P 500. It will be important for the Nasdaq to hold above the 50-dma into next week“

For the better part of the past decade, Wall Street traders would end their week with at least a casual glance at JPMorgan&#x27;s closely-followed cross-asset report written every week by the bank&#x27;s top x-asset strategist, John Normand. But not any more: as Normand wrote in his May 21 note published last Friday, &quot;this is my last research note and video, as I am moving on after 24 years.&quot; In his note, Normand discusses lessons &quot;learned in over two decades with JPM Research, covering cross-asset strategy/asset allocation, Currencies, Commodities and Fixed Income&quot; a period &quot;which covers four business cycles, three US/global recessions and four financial crises (that didn&#x27;t cause US recessions), plus hundreds o…</span>

This judicial ruling about the raging debates over group-based benefits vividly highlights the social, political and culture divisions driving U.S. politics...







A federal appellate court on Thursday invalidated the racial and gender preferences in President Biden&#x27;s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act as unconstitutional. The Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit of Appeals ruled that provisions of that law, designed to grant preferences to minority-owned small-restaurant owners for COVID relief, violate the 14th Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of equal protection under the law:

Billionaire Robert Brockman was indicted last year on the &quot;biggest U.S. tax-evasion case ever against an individual&quot;. Now, prosecutors are looking to seize his assets, including a $15 million fishing lodge in Colorado and $77.9 million in a Swiss bank account, according to Bloomberg.


The 80 year old Brockman is being accused of failing to report $2 billion in income and using a foreign company to buy secondary debt in his own software firm at a deep discount. The government says that assets tied to the debt fraud can be forfeited, which includes the fishing lodge on the Frying Pan River.

Authored by John Tamny via The American Institute for Economic Research,


Let’s travel back in time to March of 2020, when predictions of mass death related to the new coronavirus started to gain currency. One study, conducted by Imperial College’s Neil Ferguson, indicated that U.S. deaths alone would exceed 2 million. 


The above number is often used, even by conservatives and libertarians, as justification for the initial lockdowns.


“We knew so little” is the excuse, and with so many deaths expected, can anyone blame local, state, and national politicians for panicking? 







The answer is a resounding yes.  


To see why, imagine if Ferguson had predicted 30 million American deaths. Imagine the fear among the Amer…</span>

It was literally raining oil in St. Croix a couple weeks ago - and not in the good &quot;newly discovered oil&quot;-type way most people know from movies and TV.


The oil falling from the sky was the result of a &quot;flare incident&quot; that took place Limetree Bay refinery; the incident shot oil up into the sky and it was carried west by the wind before raining down on parts of the island, according to CNN. 


As a result of the incident, the US Environmental Protection Agency ordered an emergency, 60-day shutdown of the plant, citing an &quot;imminent risk&quot; to public health, the report says. The incident sent sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide into the air. 58 year old resident Dyline Thomas said: &quot;The smell wa…</span>

Almost three months after markets stumbled when after China’s top banking regulator said he’s &quot;very worried&quot; about risks emerging from bubbles in global financial markets (and China&#x27;s property sector) sparking concerns about further tightening in the world’s second-biggest economy and slamming risk assets, China has done it again and on Saturday Liang Tao, vice chairman of China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said at the International Finance Forum in Beijing that recent interest rate hikes by emerging economies could lead to a bursting of global financial asset bubbles which have been made even bigger by unprecedented pandemic easing measures by developed countries (i.e., Biden&#x27;s trillions).

Ecologist Howard Odum provided a profound insight into human expansion, stagnation and collapse. He argued that humans are wired to maximize power output (i.e., consumption) rather than maximize efficiency.


In other words, humans are wired to strip the tree of every ripe fruit and throw a party, have more children and use the surplus food to feed an army of conquest. Efficient use of resources is simply not part of what I term Wetware 1.0, the set of tools that was selected and optimized over the past 200,000 years for small hunter-gatherer tribes roaming an apparently near-infinite worl…</span>

                    <span>China Successfully Launches Cargo Rocket With Supplies For New Space Station

            
China launched an automated cargo rocket hauling supplies for the country&#x27;s new space station late Saturday from the tropical island of Hainan in the South China Sea. 


A Long March-7 Y3 rocket carrying the Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft blasted off at 8:55 pm local time from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, state-run media Global Times reported.

— China Xinhua News (@XHNews) May 29, 2021


The Tianzhou spacecraft is tasked with refueling the Tianhe space station core cabin for maintenance in orbit and also provides living necessities for future crewed missions at the space station. 







The Chinese space agency expects 11 launches through the end of this year to deliver two more modules for the Tiangong Space Station, additional supplies, and a three-member crew. Today&#x27;s launch marks the second within a month. 







Apart from launch and eventual docking at the new space station, the rocket itself is set to fall back to Earth in an uncontrolled manner. Well, that&#x27;s at least what happened earlier this month after the launch. There was no statement from Beijing about reentry plans for the rocket. 


Beijing isn&#x27;t part of the International Space Station (ISS), primarily due to the U.S. The ISS has been in low Earth orbit for a little more than 22 years and could reach its lifespan by the end of this decade. Russia has already announced it would be withdrawing from the ISS to build its own.

A new grading policy, put forth by the Baltimore City School Board, Tuesday, will allow students who are struggling and failing classes to move up to the next grade level due to the virus pandemic, according to local news Fox 45. 


Instead of holding back students, Baltimore City Public School System&#x27;s (BCPSS) new grading policy will push up struggling students who failed classes during the pandemic and have their educational status tested during the fall semester to determine what skills they missed during virtual learning classes. 







Chief Academic Officer Joan Dabrowski said the new policy is intended to &quot;avoid the punitive approach of failing students.&quot;

He was followed by Emily Mullin, executive director of major gifts, who announced, “I am a racist and a gatekeeper of white supremacy. I will work to be better.” 


The public confessions reflect the view that all white people are racist due to their race and privilege — a view contested by some as itself a form of racial intolerance or bias.


Now one of Brandeis’ Assistant Deans, Kate Slater, has triggered a similar controversy after declaring “all white people are racists.”

                    <span>US Set For Epic Labor Market Experiment: Red States Vs Blue States

            
According to JPMorgan&#x27;s Daniel Silver, as of this moment some 23 - all republican - states have announced at least some form of early reduction in pandemic-related unemployment insurance benefits ahead of the September expiration at the federal level. These programs, he suggests, are likely limiting labor supply, generating a potential economic argument for ending these programs early.


A glance at the following chart - which shows the number of US job opening vs the number of Americans who remain on some form of Pandemic unemployment benefit, would suggest that Silver is right.

Authored by Bryce Coward via Knowledge Leaders Capital blog,


The US dollar is on the verge of breaking down to the lowest level since 2014. 







This is not all that surprising. After all, the US money supply continues to grow at a rapid pace relative to other countries and quantitative easing is likely to continue at full pace through the end of 2021. Meanwhile, other countries like the UK, Canada and others are already telegraphing rate hikes. Not only that, but the US budget deficit as a percent of GDP – which has a tight correlation with the level of the US dollar index – is set to explode through 2022 and beyond. The ballooning budget deficit suggests a level of 70 or 80 on the US dollar index ov…</span>

                    <span>Paralyzed Crude Tanker Blocked Strategic Strait In Turkey 

            
Technical problems onboard a massive crude tanker Friday led to the shutdown of Turkey&#x27;s Bosphorus Strait. 


The vessel veered off course in the Bosphorus Strait, a narrow waterway that divides the city of Istanbul and connects the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.







The crude oil tanker RAVA disrupted vessel activity for three hours Friday as tugboats had to intervene and prevented the vessel from plowing into the shoreline of Istanbul&#x27;s Yenikoy district. The entire operation took eight tugs and five other vessels. The straight was reopened later in the day. 







A Turkish Coast Guard source told Sputnik late Friday night:

Misinformation, i.e., wrong claims innocently made, and disinformation, i.e., wrong claims willfully made, have long consorted to create propaganda, a distorted worldview designed to achieve some political goal.







The lines between those lies have so blurred that only a neologistic portmanteau, dismisinfoganda, fully captures recent reality.


Like an old hip-hip song, let’s break it down:

Democrat lawmakers in particular have long pushed for massively increased federal aid for public housing across the country following a decades-long decline amid a perpetual funding crisis that&#x27;s left large mid-20th century urban housing complexes derelict and crumbling.


Nowhere has the crisis been felt more than (as expected) New York City, where most of the some 325 housing projects owned by New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) are dilapidated to the point of becoming uninhabitable, for years if not decades facing interminable problems like mold and rats, water leaks and damaged roots, as well as no heat, elevators going out, and lead paint hazards.

One of the fringe benefits of Washington’s stimulus program has been inflated stock portfolios.  This has delivered a great boon for certain state governments.  In Connecticut, for example, a state that taxes capital gains as regular income, this year’s budget surplus is projected to be $470 million.


That’s quite an achievement.  Especially when you consider the state’s rainy-day fund will hit an all-time high of $4.5 billion.  Federal coronavirus stimulus is also bringing $6 billion into the state.


Yet for the greedy fellows in the Connecticut state legislature the budget surplus is not nearly enough.  They want to soak the rich for the noble purpose of helping people.  Lawmakers are proposin…</span>

Biden&#x27;s nominee for assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, Christopher Maier, if confirmed is sure to get the attention of Beijing given his words this week to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Taiwan. The man who is also head of the Department of Defense&#x27;s Defeat-ISIS Task Force urged Congressional leaders in a Thursday briefing to establish a program for US special forces to train local troops in Taiwan toward deterring a possible &quot;Chinese invasion&quot;.

What if I told you about a business with strong network effects and 200x YoY revenue growth that was preparing to offer a 25% dividend and implement a permanent share buyback program? Is that something you might be interested in?


That’s pretty much Ethereum. It’s one of the most fascinating and compelling assets in the world, but its story is obfuscated by complexity and the specter of crypto.

NASA&#x27;s Curiosity rover captured a stunning snapshot of what appears to be a cloudy day in the Arizona desert, but this picture is actually a cloudy day on Mars. 







NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA JPL) released multiple images documenting cloudy days in the thin, dry atmosphere of the Red Planet. 


&quot;Clouds are typically found at the planet&#x27;s equator in the coldest time of year, when Mars is the farthest from the Sun in its oval-shaped orbit. But one full Martian year ago – two Earth years – scientists noticed clouds forming over NASA&#x27;s Curiosity rover earlier than expected,&quot; NASA JPL&#x27;s press release read. 


Curiosity has taken about 21 photographs of the strange Martian clouds over Gale Crater.

Authored by Mike Shedlock via MishTalk.com,


Lifetime real earnings of the median male worker declined by 10% from those who entered the US labor market in 1967 to those in 1983, or roughly a loss of $136,000.







A study on Lifetime Earnings in the United States over Six Decades is worth a close look.


The study shows the United States shows a &quot;wage stagnation of average earnings and a rise in income inequality since the 1970s.&quot; The charts are based on US Social Security Administration (SSA) records over 57 years.


The charts are more than a bit confusing unless one carefully dives into the details.

Evanston, Illinois made headlines earlier this year by becoming the first city in the US to authorize &quot;reparations&quot; in the form of payments to compensate Black Americans for abuses done to family members. The Chicago suburb&#x27; City Council voted back in March to distribute $400K to eligible black households, with each qualifying family receiving up to $25K for homeownership and or improvement grants, as well as mortgage assistance.


But while proponents on the left praised the move as unprecedented, it turns out that those who designed the proposal were careful to ensure the word &quot;reparations&quot; was nowhere near it. In fact, a lengthy Bloomberg piece telling the story of how the proposal came to be s…</span>

US embassies and consulates across the globe this week flew Black Lives Matter (BLM) flags after being authorized and encouraged to do so for the first time ever in a memo by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. It&#x27;s now expected to be a regular practice, particularly in instances of race-related events or memorials.


Just ahead of the May 25 one-year anniversary of George Floyd&#x27;s death, a State Department memo was sent to all diplomatic staff worldwide saying that it &quot;supports the use of the term &#x27;Black Lives Matter&#x27; in messaging content&quot;.

                    <span>Oregon Is Proof That Leftist Politics Ultimately Lead To Tyranny And Decay

            
Authored by Brandon Smith via Alt-Market.us,


What kind of abysmal social and economic conditions would make at least five separate counties of US voters want to flee a state to join the borders of another state? Well, all it takes is a cult of insane Marxists running the entire state into the ground from the safety of their metropolitan communes while demanding that people submit their undying fealty to the draconian medical mandates of an elitist minority. Yeah, things have to get pretty bad to inspire so many people into leaving and taking half the state with them.

                    <span>Daily Caller Sues Racist Chicago Mayor For Blacklisting White Journalists

            
The Daily Caller News Foundation and one of its reporters, Thomas Catenacci, is suing Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) over her decision to only grant interviews to &#x27;black or brown journalists.&#x27;







The lawsuit, filed by Daily Caller and Judicial Watch in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that Lightfoot&#x27;s denial violates the plaintiffs&#x27; First Amendment rights, as well as Catenacci&#x27;s right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.


&quot;It’s absurd that an elected official believes she can discriminate on the basis of race,&quot; said DCNF Editor-in-Chief Ethan Barton. &quot;Mayor Lightfoot’s decision is clearly blocking press freedom through racial discriminati…</span>

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has just quietly given American companies the green light to to do whatever it takes to &quot;incentivize&quot; American workers to accept the coronavirus vaccine.







As vaccinations continue to slow, and states beef up incentives including lotteries and cash prizes to any adults who agree to get vaccinated who haven&#x27;t already, the EEOC has just issued some long-awaited guidance on how far companies can go in pushing workers to be vaccinated. Some companies, including Delta Air Lines, have said they won&#x27;t hire anyone who hasn&#x27;t already been vaccinated.

A Trump-era commission tasked with combating “false narratives about the American Founding” has urged the Biden administration to drop its proposal to fund history and civics programs that promote critical race theory or related curricula “under the misleading name of ‘anti-racism.&#x27;”

                    <span>Japan Extends State Of Emergency As Support For Canceling Olympics Rises

            
As demands to cancel the Tokyo Olympics intensify, Japan on Friday extended a state of emergency in Tokyo and eight other prefectures until June 20 as hospitals struggle to handle a rise in COVID-sickened patients.







The state of emergency had previously been slated to end on May 31, but strains on the medical system are still too intense for Japanese officials to be entirely comfortable with the current situation. Japan has seen a record number of COVID patients in critical condition in recent days, even as the number of new infections has slowed. This has prompted worries about infectious new COVID &quot;variants&quot; spreading in the country with the start of the Olympics just a few weeks away.

Following Friday&#x27;s bombshell revelation that Dr. Anthony Fauci has supported &#x27;gain of function&#x27; research, even arguing that the &quot;risks&quot; (which include a worldwide pandemic caused by a potential lab accident) were outweighed by the potential benefits to humanity, it&#x27;s worth revisiting a vote that quietly took place earlier this week in the Senate.







Sen. Paul has been arguing with Dr. Fauci about the merits of the research and whether they&#x27;re outweighed by the risks of deadly lab leaks for weeks now. He memorably took the good doctor to task during a hearing of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee hectoring over his prior support for gain of function research in China, to …</span>

Many industries were throttled, bludgeoned, beaten, and even destroyed during the lockdowns of 2020. It will be years before the damage is repaired, and some of it is irreparable. 







One industry that did not suffer was that which was and is devoted to writing scientific papers on the Coronavirus. Talk about boom times! A report from October 2020 estimates that 87,000 studies have been written and published in some form on the topic. It’s surely more than 100,000 by now. These writers do not produce content out of the goodness of their hearts. It’s the old rule: subsidize something (thank you Bill Gates) and you get more of it.

Election season in Mexico has always been a dangerous game, with politicians regularly knocked off by cartels seeking to install &#x27;friendly&#x27; candidates by process of elimination. 







Since the start of the electoral process in Sep. 2020, eighty-eight politicians have been murdered nationwide, according to TeleSur. The most recent, Citizens Movement (MC) candidate Alma Barragan, was shot to death while driving by unidentified assailants, just a few hours after she attended a campaign event. Barragan marks the third murdered candidate in Guanajuato alone ahead of the region&#x27;s June 6 election.

Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer joined 43 California counties on May 26 in filing a civil lawsuit against the early release of 76,000 state inmates.



“It is my job as district attorney to keep Orange County safe,” Spitzer said in a press release.


“The public must be given the opportunity to question why the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation would decide that returning murders, child molesters, and rapists back into our neighborhoods more quickly somehow constitutes an emergency.”

Among the &quot;new&quot; things that Americans will notice during this year&#x27;s post-Covid Memorial Day will be skyrocketing prices at the pump.


Drivers are in store for the highest prices in seven years this summer, Reuters writes this week, as retail gas prices are the most expensive since 2014 at about $3.04 per gallon. 







And those prices have nowhere to go but up, as a year&#x27;s worth of pent up demand for leisure activities, vacation and summer sun come to fruition over the next three or four months. This could drive up prices even further during peak travel weeks during the summer.

Authored by Matt Taibbi via TK News,


Joe Biden is cruising, in a happy-place few politicians reach. Outside of a few grumpy right-wing outlets he faces almost no hostile press questioning, political threats within his own party are minimal, and his approval rating, if one believes the latest Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, hovers at an astonishing 64%.





Biden has the press paper-trained to a degree we haven’t seen in modern times. Not even at the height of the media’s drooling love affair with Barack Obama — a phenomenon I confess I was part of — did we ever see such enthusiastic, reflexive backing of White House messaging. The Biden press even reverses course on a dime when needed, with the past weeks being a supreme e…</span>

Well that was a different month - bonds were bid, big-tech dumped (as Meme stocks soared), crypto puked along with the dollar but bullion was best bid.







Is it time to cut the dollar&#x27;s rope?

                    <span>Peter Schiff: Inflation Crashes The Party

            
Authored by Peter Schiff via SchiffGold.com,


It’s dawning on many investors that our post-Covid financial problems may not be as easily solved as Washington claims...







The latest clue that trouble is brewing has come from the sudden and dramatic arrival of inflation. On May 12, it was revealed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) had risen 4.2% year-over-year, the fastest pace since 2008.


Some tried to downplay concern by pointing out that the gains resulted from the “base effect” of comparing current prices with the artificially depressed “Covid lockdown” prices of March and April of last year. But that ignores the more alarming trend of near-term price acceleration.

The recent surge in retail trading, which has seen the WallStreetBets army flood back into meme stocks for the second time since the epic February short squeeze sending names like AMC and GME soaring even as other high risk-reward corners of the market have remained stagnant...

America&#x27;s top virologist, Anthony Fauci, argued in 2012 that the risks of a lab accident sparking a pandemic are outweighed by the potential benefits of manipulating viruses via gain-of-function research, according to previously unsurfaced remarks reported by Sharri Markson via The Australian.







&quot;In an unlikely but conceivable turn of events, what if that scientist becomes infected with the virus, which leads to an outbreak and ultimately triggers a pandemic?&quot; Fauci wrote in the American Society for Microbiology in 2012, adding &quot;Many ask reasonable questions: given the possibility of such a scenario – however remote – should the initial experiments have been performed and/or pub…</span>

                    <span>&#x27;Much Less Than Meets The Eye&#x27; - Biden Officially Unveils Budget With Retroactive Capital Gains Tax Hike

            
Update (1330ET): President Biden just released the much-leaked and strawman&#x27;d Fiscal Year 2022 budget request to Congress on Friday, the first formal budget of his presidency.


The topline budget request for 2022 is $6 trillion. But of this, as we detailed below, only $300 billion is new spending requested for next year. Instead, the vast majority of it will be spent on programs the government is obligated by law to fund, like Medicare, Social Security and interest on the national debt. 



“Put together, this budget is an agenda for robust, durable economic growth and broadly shared prosperity,” said Shalanda Young, Biden’s acting White House budget director.

It was back in February when we first said that (almost) nobody was paying attention to the &quot;mind-boggling liquidity&quot; that was about to hit the markets in the form of hundreds of billions in cash released from the Treasury&#x27;s TGA account held at the Fed. This historic liquidity injection by the Treasury and not the Fed (which continues to this day to inject $120BN in liquidity monthly from its ongoing QE) was, as we put it, a form of backdoor QE, which would push asset prices higher and depress real rates.

Once upon a time, we couldn&#x27;t go an hour without some dire news involving Deutsche Bank (and its tens of trillions of gross notional derivatives). Now, it&#x27;s Credit Suisse&#x27;s turn.


In what was at least the third flashing-red headline for the day referencing the scandal-plagued Swiss Bank, moments ago Bloomberg reported that Credit Suisse, still humiliated from the billions it lost on Archegos and Greensill and countless subsequent banker terminations and defections, has temporarily barred clients from pulling their cash from a feeder fund that that was sold as an investment option for rich clients at the bank’s wealth arm, and which invests with Renaissance Technologies &quot;after the str…</span>

                    <span>Tesla Reportedly &quot;Scrambling&quot; For Instrument Cluster Supplies

            
We may have a little more insight as to reports yesterday that Tesla was pre-paying for semiconductor parts to secure supply. Yesterday, we guessed that Tesla&#x27;s new &quot;pre-payment&quot; terms could be a result of suppliers showing little patience with the automaker, who has over $6 billion in payables.


But a new report overnight from DigiTimes Asia sheds more light on the situation, leading us to believe that Tesla could simply be short of supplies and desperately in need of parts to be able to hit production targets. 


The report notes that Tesla is &quot;scrambling&quot; for instrument cluster supplies:



Tesla is reportedly approaching IC suppliers in Taiwan, Korea and the US, seeking to secure steady supplies of au…</span>

With Tesla falling out of favor in China, one domestic EV maker, Li Auto, is predicting a tailwind.


The Chinese Tesla rival, which produces the Li One SUV, predicts that its sales will rise at least 15% in from April to June as a result of Tesla running &quot;foul of angry Chinese customers,&quot; SCMP reported on Wednesday. 


The company&#x27;s Li One SUV competes with Tesla&#x27;s Model Y. It is an extended-range sport-utility vehicle (SUV) that is priced at 328,000 yuan (US$51,316), according to the report. 


Li Auto said on Wednesday that Q2 deliveries would come in between 14,500 units and 15,500 units, up from estimates of 12,579 in the first three months of the year. Li reported a 13% decli…</span>

An Atlanta city councilman running for mayor, who last year supported a measure to reduce city police funding by tens of millions of dollars, had his car stolen by children on Wednesday, he and police confirmed.







Councilman Antonio Brown had been attending a ceremony in northeastern Atlanta at 12 p.m. Wednesday when several children jumped into his vehicle and drove away, he said.



“You don’t immediately think, ‘Oh, these kids are going to steal my car,’” Brown told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, referring to the incident, adding that the thieves appeared to be children, although one of them “acted as though he had a gun…</span>

Lockheed Martin and General Motors are teaming to develop the next-generation lunar vehicle for NASA&#x27;s upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon. 


The Artemis program aims to land astronauts on the lunar surface by the midpoint of the decade. For exploration purposes, astronauts will need &quot;surface mobility that is critical to enable and sustain long-term exploration of the lunar surface. These next-generation rovers will dramatically extend the range of astronauts,&quot; a Lockheed press release read. 







The new lunar vehicle &quot;may allow astronauts to explore the lunar surface in unprecedented fashion and support discovery in places where humans have never gone before,&quot; the defense contract continued.

“A long-term outage owing to EMP could disable most critical supply chains, leaving the U.S. population living in conditions similar to centuries past, prior to the advent of electric power. In the 1800s, the U.S. population was less than 60 million, and those people had many skills and assets necessary for survival without today’s infrastructure. An extended blackout today could result in the death of a large fraction of the American people through the effects of societal collapse, disease and starvation.

                    <span>Australia Imposes 4th COVID Lockdown On Melbourne As New Cluster Found

            
Despite essentially cutting off all international travel in an attempt to &quot;raise the drawbridge&quot; and keep out COVID-19 after mostly purging it from their society, Australia is entering its fourth COVID-inspired lockdown in Melbourne, the country&#x27;s second-largest city. The lockdown began Thursday and was set to remain in place for a week for Melbourne and the rest of Victoria state after a new cluster of cases was uncovered, yielding 26 new infections, including one person who was sent to intensive care, the AP reports.


Another 10K people have reportedly had some form of contact with those infected.

                    <span>Will The Madness Of 2020 Last?

            
Authored by Victor Davis Hanson, op-ed via The Epoch Times,


The COVID-19 pandemic is ending with mass vaccinations. So is the national quarantine. The rioting, looting, and arson that began in the summer of 2020 is finally sputtering out.


The acrimony over the 2020 election is fading. Trump Derangement Syndrome became abstract when Donald Trump left office and was ostracized from social media.


In other words, the American people are slowly regaining their senses after the epidemic of mass hysteria that gripped the nation last year.







But many Americans wonder whether what Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and the hard left wrought last year will last when the nation is no longer gripped by 2020 madness.

                    <span>The Fed Explains Why Stocks Melt-Up In Overnight Trading

            
By now everyone has seen some iteration of this chart (most recently discussed here), which shows that whereas stocks are generally flat over longer periods of time during the regular &quot;cash&quot;, or day session, they tend to melt up during the overnight hours when liquidity is far lower and when the &quot;pajama trades&quot; come out and play.







And while there is no single, widely accepted reason for this &quot;overnight drift&quot;, the post-closed meltup phenomenon has been one of the most popular and recurring strategies in equity markets, with many traders selling spoos when the day session begins and then re-buying at the market close in pursuit of scarce alpha.

Fifteen Republican State Treasurers sent a warning that they will pull assets from financial institutions if they give in to Federal pressure to de-carbonize and “refuse to lend to or invest in” the fossil fuel and coal industry.

                    <span>WeWork Pays Another $245M To Former CEO Adam Neumann To Clear Last Obstacle To SPAC Deal

            
WeWork co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann may well be remembered as the worst CEO ever. But that hasn&#x27;t stopped him from collecting billions of dollars in payouts on his way out the door at WeWork, as SoftBank&#x27;s Masayoshi Son was forced to effectively bribe Neumann to relinquish control of the flailing office rental company.







A legal fight erupted when SoftBank tried to renege on some $3 billion it owed to Neumann and other early investors, but it appears this issue was settled out of court.


But according to the latest documents released by the company, Neumann has just received even more goodies from the firm, including a final &quot;enhanced&quot; package worth roughly one qua…</span>

                    <span>&#x27;It Would Be Detrimental To A Lot Of Companies&#x27;: Jamie Dimon Slams Biden Tax Plan

            
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon went scorched earth on President Biden&#x27;s tax plan, which would raise the current corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, arguing that it would result in capital flight out of the United States.







&quot;The tax increase is actually four times what the tax decrease was from 2017,&quot; Dimon said during a Thursday virtual hearing before the US House Committee on Financial Services. &quot;You all know the phrase the devil is in the details, well the details here are all that matter, not the top line of 28%.&quot;


&quot;If you want to have a healthy, growing, competitive America against the rest of the world, you need a global, competitive tax rate,&quot; Dimon added. &quot;It would be detrimental to a lot of companies, it would push a lot of capital overseas.&quot;





Dimon cast doubt on the Biden tax plan earlier this month, calling it &#x27;a little crazy,&#x27; however today&#x27;s comments mark the strongest pushback yet from the top banker.


&quot;We’re just throwing money. It doesn’t work,&quot; Dimon said in a recorded interview for the JPMorgan general membership meeting on May 6, adding &quot;I’m concerned about how the money’s going to be spent.&quot;


&quot;We already waste tremendous sums of money.&quot;

China&#x27;s recent aggressive crackdown on soaring commodity prices (going as far as dragging the PBOC&#x27;s monetary regime into it, with the central bank stating this morning that the surging yuan is in no way a response to explosive commodity prices, honestly), has provided the world&#x27;s deflationists with some hope that the recent huge spike in commodity prices may be coming to an end. To others, like Goldman&#x27;s extremely bullish commodities team, China&#x27;s intervention has led to a rather unpleasant hit to its thesis, and in response today&#x27;s Goldman&#x27;s head of commodities, Jeffrey Currie drafted a note saying that the pullback in commodities after China’s warnings over onshore specu…</span>

Authored by Patrick Andriesen via IllinoisPolicy.org,


Grocery and liquor stores would be barred from selling beer, wine and liquor after 10 p.m. if Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot gets her way. She said the move would curb crime by stopping gatherings outside liquor stores and help recovering bars and restaurants.







Mayor Lightfoot introduced an amendment Wednesday that would permanently ban Chicago stores from selling beer, wine and other alcoholic drinks after 10 p.m.


In April 2020, Lightfoot instituted the controversial 9 p.m. liquor curfew in Chicago to prevent residents from gathering outside during the coronavirus pandemic. Stores had been allowed to stay open until 2 a.m. most…</span>

Never one for understatement, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale appeared on CNBC this week to discuss cryptocurrencies and the world&#x27;s central banks efforts to re-centralize control of what the establishment is clearly losing control over.

Authored by Cal Thomas, op-ed via The Epoch Times,


Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas is reportedly considering the development of tools that would help America’s children discern truth from lies and know when they are being fed “disinformation.”







The Washington Times, which first reported the story, says a department spokesperson declined to give details, but that more information would be revealed “in the coming weeks.”


Mayorkas might want to start by fact-checking his recent claim that the U.S. southern border is “closed.” He made the statement when news pictures showed waves of people crossing the border. Should kids believe him, or their “lying eyes”?

                    <span>​​​​​​​Russian Spy Ship Quietly Parked In Waters Off Hawaii

            
A Russian Navy surveillance ship parked in international waters off Kauai, an island in the Central Pacific, part of the Hawaiian archipelago, has delayed a Missile Defense Agency missile test, according to Honolulu Star-Advertiser. 


The US Pacific Fleet confirmed Wednesday that it &quot;is aware of the Russian vessel operating in international waters in the vicinity of Hawaii, and will continue to track it through the duration of its time here.&quot; 


The ship has been operating in international waters just 13 nautical miles west of Kauai for several days. The vessel is not broadcasting an automatic identification system signal. 



&quot;Through maritime patrol aircraft, surface ships and joint capabilities, we can closely monitor all vessels in the Indo-Pacific area of operations,&quot; US Pacific Fleet&#x27;s statement continued. 



U.S. Naval Institute News first identified the presence of the spy ship, indicating it was a Russian Navy Vishnya-class auxiliary general intelligence (AGI) ship Kareliya (SSV-535). Honolulu Star-Advertiser then expanded on this and said the vessel is in the vicinity of the Pacific Missile Range and has &quot;delayed&quot; a missile test. 







The question remains: Why does a Russian signals intelligence vessel sit off the coast of Kauai? Is Moscow sending the Biden administration a message of new strength in the Pacific?

And while April and the start of May exhibited a similar continued decline in both retail participation and performance of &quot;retail favorite&quot; stocks, which underperformed the broader market by 8% since mid-March, things have changed dramatically in the past two weeks and as Goldman notes in a new piece discussing the &quot;Recent performance of stocks with high levels of retail activity&quot;, stocks with high retail trading volumes have outperformed by 5% since May 12th, with half of this outperformance occurring yesterday (Wednesday). 


Echoing JPMorgan&#x27;s observations, Goldman then notes that while declines in daily trades at retail brokers showed significant declines last week (DARTs), leading to fresh concerns that retail trading activity was on the decline - with many going so far as to conclude that retail investors were no longer investing their stimmies - this too appears to have been the wrong conclusion, as the rise in retail stocks yesterday and especially today, when both GME and AMC have soared...







... suggesting it may be too early to call an end to elevated retail activity.







So what are retail investors buying? Based on Goldman&#x27;s “small-lot trading” analysis, these are the 50 stocks where retail was the most active yesterday in shares and options.







Not enough? Here are the stocks with high “small lot” trading activity in Options

Authored by Steve Wastson via Summit News,


President Trump‘s former national security advisor Michael Flynn commented on the renewed focus on the theory that the coronavirus came from a lab in Wuhan, saying that he believes it was a ‘weaponised operation’.



“We’ve had over a year of people all over the world having to answer tough questions,” Flynn said during an interview on 1320 AM WJAS.



The three star general continued “The people in this country are demanding answers. I believe we what we are going to find out is that this was a weaponized operation by the nation of China with some collaboration… with other countries.”

If you had a sneaking suspicion that Wall Street was starting to bet against the &quot;untouchable&quot; Cathie Wood, as we did over the last couple months, you were right.


Today it was revealed that &quot;about two dozen investment advisers&quot; that included Balyasny Asset Management and a unit of Blackstone bought put options on ARK&#x27;s Innovation ETF during the first quarter. Blackstone bought puts on 1.3 million ARKK shares and Balyasny acquired puts on 436,500 shares. 


The managers saw Wood&#x27;s fund as a &quot;alternative to buffer against a slump in stocks that surged during the pandemic,&quot; that buying puts on an index, the report said. In other words, the asset managers were so confident in Wood&#x27;s ab…</span>

President Biden is just fine releasing the US Intelligence community&#x27;s 90-day examination of where COVID-19 originated, unless it contains surprises.


Shortly before boarding Air Force One for a Thursday trio to Ohio, Biden was ashed whether he planned to release the intelligence report, to which he replied &quot;Yes,&quot; adding &quot;unless there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m unaware of.&quot;

                    <span>Life Insurance &amp; COVID-19; Something Doesn&#x27;t Make Sense

            
Authored by Jeff Harris via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace &amp; Prosperity,


You would think that during the worst Pandemic since the 1918 Spanish Flu life insurance companies would be hedging their bets to avoid major losses from Covid-19. 


I haven’t written a life policy for several years so I was wondering what was going on?


I called one of the brokers I deal with that interacts with hundreds of big life insurers to get an inside look into how the Covid crisis has changed their business.





Imagine my surprise when she said it was pretty much business as usual!


Last year when the hysteria was just getting ramped up she did say the companies temporarily tightened up underwriting and reduced the amount of coverage they would offer. But as time went by and the hard data came rolling in those same companies went back to business as usual.
I asked her specifically if life insurers wanted a Covid test as part of the underwriting process and she said none that she was aware of.


Hmm, that’s pretty interesting isn’t it?


The most lethal pandemic in decades descends on the globe with deadly mutations taking millions of innocent lives and the life insurance companies couldn’t care less.
I also asked if the cost per thousand of coverage had increased due to Covid and again she said no.


Rates were pretty much the same as they were before the Covid Pandemic ravaged the earth.


Life Insurance companies are very risk adverse. 


They don’t like losing money to unnecessary claims.


The fact they’re treating Covid as a nonevent should be an indicator that something is very wrong with the whole narrative.

President Biden, possibly most famous for his - and his son&#x27;s - business dealings in China coming into question whilst running for the Presidency, may wake up this week to find out from one of his top advisors that he&#x27;s now a China hawk.


That is, if you ask Kurt Campbell, the U.S. coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs on the National Security Council. 


Campbell said this week that the U.S. was &quot;entering a period of intense competition with China as the government running the world’s second-biggest economy becomes ever more tightly controlled by President Xi Jinping,&quot; according to Bloomberg. 


Campbell, speaking at Stanford University, commented: “The period that was broadly described as engage…</span>

Criminals who repeatedly targeted an auto shop in Spring Lake, North Carolina by leaving racist graffiti referencing the KKK and Nazis turned out to be two African-American men after the owner caught them on camera.







Business owner Dwyane Haynesworth (who is black) took action after having a car stole off his lot and then discovering the racist graffiti, which included a drawing of a swastika.


After setting up the security cameras, that same night the criminals returned and broke into more vehicles before smashing windows and attempting to hot wire one of the cars.

Real Vision managing editor Ed Harrison welcomes Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, back to the Daily Briefing to update viewers on how the bond market is reacting to the re-opening of the economy and the sustained dovishness of the Federal Reserve. Bianco analyzes how the Fed’s bias towards employment within its dual mandate is impacting inflation expectations and bond yields, and he and Harrison discuss today’s jobless claims within that context as well as ballooning budget deficits and central bank balance sheet expansion.

We knew it would be a crazy day for today&#x27;s reverse repo early this morning, when the overnight GCF repo rate traded at -0.01% and refused to rise, an indication that there was far too much money chasing good collateral.







Looking at the scramble for repo, interbroker dealer Wrightson ICAP said on Thursday morning that it saw Reverse Repo volumes rising to around $470 billion Thursday, though the risks are “still tilted to the high side.”


They were, because moments ago the Fed announced that at 1:15pm some 50 counterparties (up from 46 on Wednesday) parked $485.329BN in reserves with the Fed (in exchange for the generous rate of 0.000%), which was up $35BN overnight, up $134BN in the past wee…</span>

On Wednesday Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced efforts to combat the growing trend of rampant and unpredictable blackouts experienced across parts of the country of over 80 million people at the start of a hot summer, particularly in already strained major cities. By many accounts what was somewhat already a &quot;norm&quot; under American sanctions has come early this year - namely the sporadic blackouts, increasingly angering the population just ahead of a key presidential election in June.

There&#x27;s been a lot of speculation this year about what it might take for western governments like the US to meet the carbon emissions targets laid out in the Paris Accords, which President Biden has enthusiastically rejoined. One study by the IEA concluded that all oil and gas firms would have to halt new projects in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

After nearly 18 months of punishing anyone who suggested that COVID-19 might have originated in a Wuhan lab, Facebook has decided to stop removing posts which claim the virus was man-made or manufactured, a company spokesperson told Politico on Wednesday.







The move comes after the Wall Street Journal reported that three lab workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were hospitalized in late 2019 with symptoms consistent with the virus - building on previous reporting by the Washington Post&#x27;s Josh Rogin. Both articles cast doubt on the mainstream media&#x27;s unsupported claim that COVID-19 jumped from bats to humans through an intermediary species - as opposed to…</span>

                    <span>Illinois Constitutional Amendment Is &quot;A Monstrous Giveaway To Public Unions&quot;

            
Authored by Mark Glennon via Wirepoints.org,


Most Illinoisans are unaware, but their General Assembly is poised to pass a resolution for a state constitutional amendment, the consequences of which are hard to overstate. It would vastly expand union power, permanently, particularly public union power that is already extreme.







Limited media coverage so far characterizes the amendment mostly as an attempt to permanently ban right-to-work and lock in current worker protections. That would be bad enough, since the majority of states are now right to work including nearby competitors Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana and Iowa. And Illinois is already an outlier in how much power it has given to …</span>

                    <span>Global Chip Hub Taiwan Hammered By Triple Blow Of Drought, Blackouts And COVID Surge

            
The calm of a sunny May afternoon in Taiwan was broken by what the Nikkei describes as a crescendo of smartphones buzzing due to a national emergency alert: electricity blackouts were coming due to a malfunction at a power plant in the south of the island. People had no time to prepare. There were more than 30 reports of people being trapped in elevators half an hour after the warning in the capital city.


&quot;I was talking to my clients... but our building suddenly blacked out. The air conditioning as well as WiFi crashed completely, so I went home early,&quot; a manager with the surname of Lin working in the Neihu Science Park in Taipei, where many top tech companies have offices, told Nikkei …</span>

                    <span>Are Chinese Stocks Ready To Outperform?

            
By Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at SaxoBank


Summary: Chinese equities were rallying 3.6% today on signals from the Chinese government to curb inflationary pressures from rising commodity markets reducing inflation expectations and boosting the earnings outlook. US equities are currently valued at a valuation premium to Chinese equities which suggest historically that Chinese equities could outperform over the next 26 weeks. The two country&#x27;s technology sectors are equally valued on a 2-year forward basis on EV/EBITDA but with a valuation skew on Chinese technology mega caps making them more attractive on valuation. The long-term growth outlook is better for Chinese technology companies and thus we expect the market to beg…</span>

While many of the SPACs he has sponsored have seen less than stellar returns, Chamath Palihapitiya and his VC firm, Social Capital, are doing just fine.  Palihapitiya has been a player in Silicon Valley for years, but thanks to the SPAC boom, 2020 was a breakout year for the former Facebook employee. Not only did he rake in profits for his firm and his investors, but SPACs have changed the nature of the IPO process







Somewhat lost in all the excitement of the SPAC boom is the fact that Social Capital is a VC firm that has invested in more than 70 companies during the past decade, which has been a lucrative one for Silicon Valley. Social Capi…</span>

Authored by Liam Brooks via AmericanThinker.com,


Teen climate zealot Greta Thunberg raised some eyebrows last week when she tossed an f-bomb in a video she posted Saturday to commemorate the International Day of Biological Diversity. (Something I&#x27;ve admittedly never heard of.) 



&quot;Our relationship with nature is broken,&quot; Saint Greta flatly stated.


&quot;But relationships can change. If we don&#x27;t change, we are f**ked.&quot;




”Our relationship with nature is broken. But relationships can change. When we protect nature - we are nature protecting itself.”

                    <span>&quot;Rescue Operation Underway&quot; - Boat With 200 Passengers Sinks In Nigeria

            
Dozens of people are missing in north-western Nigeria after a boat carrying 200 capsized on Wednesday, according to Reuters, citing a state spokesperson.



&quot;The boat was ferrying about 200 passengers&quot; coming from the neighboring country of Niger, said Yahaya Sarki, a spokesperson for the governor of Kebbi.


&quot;Their locally made wooden boat capsized mid-water,&quot; Sarki said. &quot;Bodies are still being recovered. We can&#x27;t ascertain the number for now.&quot;



The boat was reportedly overloaded when it suddenly snapped into two in the middle of the Niger River. 







Reports of how many people on board vary from news agency to news agency—some say between 160 and 200.


Authorities in Kebbi State told the BBC that first responders had been dispatched to the scene to search for survivors. 



&quot;A rescue operation is underway, but only 22 survivors and one dead body have been recovered,&quot; a local official reportedly said.



Qasimu Umar Wara, a resident of Wara town, told Reuters the passengers were returning from a newly-discovered gold vein in Niger. 



&quot;They usually go there in the evenings and return to Wara in the morning,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of them are petty traders, food vendors and the local miners.&quot;



The wooden boat is reportedly rated for 80 passengers, and the accident is likely due to overloading.

Since Bill and Melinda Gates first announced their divorce earlier this month, barely a day has passed without some unflattering new revelation, as the American media apparently scrambles to compensate for all those years where it treated Bill Gates with kid gloves.


It&#x27;s bad enough that Melinda reportedly divorced Bill over his insistence on maintaining ties with Jeffrey Epstein, something that has stoked speculation about whether Gates might face more sexual harassment allegations (sure enough, reports have emerged claiming he was essentially pushed out at Microsoft over improper behavior involving a female subordinate) or that he might be caught up in the…</span>

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Following calls last summer from groups such as Black Lives Matter to “defund the police,” a number of city officials are now walking back statements to go through with cutting funding to law enforcement due to surges in crime levels.


The Minneapolis City Council several months ago voted to approve $6.4 million more in funding to the police department, coming after a number of councilmembers last year pledged to completely abolish the department.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


A professor with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine has said that there is a general dismissal of the fact that more than half of all Americans have developed natural immunity to the coronavirus and that it constitutes “one of the biggest failures of our current medical leadership.”







Dr. Marty Makary made the comments during a recent interview, noting that “natural immunity works” and it is wrong to vilify those who don’t want the vaccine because they have already recovered from the virus.


Makary criticised “the most slow, reactionary, political CDC in American history” for not clearly communicati…</span>

                    <span>US Troops Will Be Out Of Afghanistan By July: Pentagon Officials

            
Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


According to a report from The New York Times, US troops are expected to be out of Afghanistan by early to mid-July, well before the September 11th deadline set by President Biden.


Unnamed US officials told the Times that Washington’s allies are also expected to be out by July, although Germany is apparently struggling to keep up the pace. US Central Command on Tuesday said the Afghanistan withdrawal process was about 16 to 25 percent complete.

                    <span>&quot;Change Is Coming&quot; - Engine No. 1 Wins Two Exxon Board Seats  

            
Activist firm Engine No. 1 has won at least two seats on the board of Exxon Mobile Corp. following a multi-month battle over the oil giant&#x27;s board of directors to change the company&#x27;s path towards one centered around achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner, according to WSJ.







Engine No. 1, an upstart hedge fund, owns a tiny 0.02% stake in Exxon, has gone on a blitz against the company since December to shift away from fossil fuels to a zero-carbon world. The fund was founded by veteran hedge fund investor Chris James. 


Charlie Penner, one of Engine No. 1&#x27;s leaders, told investors at Wednesday&#x27;s annual shareholder meeting that Exxon management is &quot;determined to fight off the future for…</span>

                    <span>Suddenly The Market No Longer Sees Jackson Hole As Taper D-Day

            
Just a few weeks ago, the market was rife with speculation that amid galloping inflation, the Fed would almost certainly breach the topic of the infamous taper during its June 16 FOMC meeting, and if not then, then no later than the September 22 meeting, which takes place just after the late-August Jackson Hole central banker outing in which most of the Fed&#x27;s &quot;radical&quot; ideas in the past decade have been introduced.


Not any more. As Bloomberg&#x27;s Stephen Spratt points out, 3-month 10-year implied swaption vol - a closely-watched metric of how much TSY prices may move over the period - has been steadily declining, and hit the lowest levels since early March, amid a non-stop barrage of central bankers repeating i…</span>

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


Five people were arrested overnight in Portland, Oregon after a riot broke out on the anniversary of George Floyd’s death.


The quintet was part of a crowd who set a fire in a dumpster next to the Justice Center, a building that houses a jail and law enforcement offices, while chanting “Burn the building down,” according to a Portland Police Bureau incident summary and photographs and video footage from the scene.

Authored by Stephen Roach via Project-Syndicate,


The US Federal Reserve is insisting that recent increases in the price of food, construction materials, used cars, personal health products, gasoline, and appliances reflect transitory factors that will quickly fade with post-pandemic normalization. But what if they are a harbinger, not a &quot;noisy&quot; deviation?







Memories can be tricky. I have long been haunted by the inflation of the 1970s. Fifty years ago, when I had just started my career as a professional economist at the Federal Reserve, I was witness to the birth of the Great Inflation as a Fed insider. That left me with the recurring nightmares of a financial post-traumatic stress disorder. The bad dre…</span>

Amid the fifth and what&#x27;s expected to be the final round of Iran nuclear talks in Vienna, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has voiced that time is running out on reaching an agreement given the Islamic Republic has already reached bomb-building capability in terms of enriched uranium purity levels. 


IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told Financial Times that Iran has reached uranium purity levels that &quot;only countries making bombs are reaching&quot; after routinely ramping up enrichment since Trump pulled out of the Obama-era JCPOA back in May 2018.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


The long-awaited, though partial, release of a memorandum from the Justice Department this week left many “frustrated,” as predicted by the Washington Post, in Washington. The reason is what it did not contain.  Critics had sought the memo as the “smoking gun” to show how former Attorney General Bill Barr scuttled any obstruction charges against Donald Trump.


Instead, the memo showed the opposite. 







The staff of the OLC actually found that the allegations did not meet the standard of obstruction even without any defenses or privileges related to Trump’s office.


The issue of obstruction of justice ran throughout Barr’s second…</span>

                    <span>It Reeks Of Deflation After Second Stellar Treasury Auction In A Row

            
After yesterday&#x27;s blockbuster 2Y auction which pushed bond yields sharply lower and which we said was an indication that the inflationary storm has passed with bond traders no longer expecting any rate hikes for the foreseeable future, moments ago the stench of deflation was positively rancid after today&#x27;s $61BN 5-Year auction was just as almost as solid as Tuesday&#x27;s auction.


Printing at a high yield of 0.788%, the 2Y auction stopped 5.5bps below April&#x27;s auction and also stopped through the When Issued 0.794% by 0.6bps, the first stop through for the tenor since Jan 2021.


Meanwhile, and like yesterday, the Bid to Cover jumped, rising from 2.31 last month to 2.49 today, the highest since Sept 2020 and obviously well above the six-auction average of 2.34.


The internals were also stellar with Indirects taking down a whopping 64.4%, the highest foreign award since August 2020 and far above the 57.9% recent average. And with Directs taking down a lower than average 14.9%, Dealers were left holding 20.8% of the auction, the lowest since August.







Overall, a stellar bond auction, and one which together with yesterday&#x27;s 2Y auction suggests that demand for tomorrow&#x27;s 7Y issuance will be vastly greater compared to the dismal 7Y bond sale in late February when the bellybuster auction was nearly a flop and sparked a major bond and stock market selloff.

by Robert Dalheim of Woodworking Network







The U.S. Department of Commerce says it will seek to double tariff rates on most Canadian softwood lumber, angering home builders. New rates vary by company. West Fraser goes from 9 percent to 11.4 percent, Canfor from 4.6 to 21 percent, Resolute Forest from 20.3 to 30.2 percent, and J.D. Irving from 4.2 to 15.8 percent.


The overall increase is from 9 percent to 18.32 percent.


Home builders, who had been urging for a removal of tariffs, expressed their disappointment.

Authored by Janita Kan via The Epoch Times,


Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on Monday said he was willing to support a Democrat-led bill that was passed by the House to create an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 breach of the U.S. Capitol.







Romney answered that he “would support the bill” when asked by reporters how he would vote if Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) starts a debate on the House bill, according to multiple congressional reporters. He is the first Republican in the Senate to do so.


The Utah senator’s comments come on the same day that Schumer vowed to bring the bill for a vote on the Senate floor.

Last week&#x27;s good news of easing vessel congestion earlier this month outside the busiest U.S. gateway for trade with Asia showed a glimmer of hope that supply chain disruptions could subside had flipped last week as more containerships join the queue.  


Bloomberg data shows the number of containerships queuing off the coast of Los Angeles reached the highest in two weeks.


As of Sunday, 21 containerships were anchored waiting for entry into L.A.-Long Beach, compared with 19 a week earlier. The bottleneck peaked at around 40 vessels in the queue in early February and has steadily declined ever since, but the latest data shows progress could be reversing.

On May 25th, the Iranian Army kicked off a large-scale military drill to practice electronic warfare tactics, this drill on electronic warfare is dubbed ‘Separ-e-Aseman 1400’ (Sky Shield 1400).







According to a statement, this joint drill is being held by the strategic electronic warfare forces of the four forces of the Army and covers large areas of Iran. Rapid response and electronic warfare units of the Army’s Ground Force, Air Force, Navy and Air Defense are participating in the joint aerial maneuvers, codenamed Sky Shield 1400, whose headquarters will be located in Iran’s central province of Isfahan.

Authored by John Tamny via RealClear Markets (emphasis ours),


If you want to act in movies or on television in Hollywood, you must be a member of the Screen Actors Guild. That’s why the accession of a “SAG” card is such a momentous achievement for actors. It means they’re Hollywood legal as it were.







So why does acting professionally require union membership? The answer is very simple: SAG wants to prevent those yearning to be stars from flooding the market, and subsequently bidding starting wages down to zero.


It’s as old as the hills for actors and actresses to wistfully proclaim that “I just want a chance to show them what I can do.” Since they’re all looking for a break, it’s not unreasonable to specula…</span>

After by the end of last year New York City&#x27;s beleaguered subways fell to carrying a mere 30% of pre-pandemic volumes but also as vandalism and random violent attacks soared, sparking widespread concern over safety, officials with the state&#x27;s Metropolitan Transportation Authority are now looking to spend $2.2 million a month on private security guards, a recent Wall Street Journal report confirmed.


By month&#x27;s end some 200 private guards are expected to be present at stations and on trains, which is double what it&#x27;s been in prior months - after the MTA urged more city police amid rising crime in areas of the transit system where there&#x27;s often near-deserted platforms given the prior COVI…</span>

I cannot identify who exactly popularized the term “woke.”


But I’ve had cause to wheel it out here and elsewhere on and off for the past few years, generally when describing some absurd piece of academic or corporate or government obeisance to political correctness.

                    <span>Goldman Wins Regulatory Approval To Launch Chinese Wealth Management Business

            
Ever since China started allowing American money managers access to the hundreds of millions of middle class Chinese investors and savers via &quot;joint ventures&quot; with domestic firms, some of the biggest US buy-side firms, including BlackRock and Vanguard, have already launched their Chinese operations.


And now, after months of cajoling local regulators, it appears Goldman Sachs has just won approval to launch a wealth management venture of its own alongside ICBC, one of China&#x27;s largest banks, the FT says.


So pretty soon, the Chinese elite will have the opportunity to join their American peers by becoming Goldman clients.

Authored by Jonathan Maze via RestaurantBusinessOnline.com,


Subway franchisees recently started pushing the company to dramatically reduce the ongoing fees they pay the company in a bid to keep more of them in business.







But Subway is moving in the other direction. The sandwich giant’s newest franchise agreement increases their ongoing royalty payments by 25%, numerous sources told Restaurant Business. The result would send higher what many say is an already unusually high royalty rate at a time when the chain is closing more than 1,000 locations a year.


Currently, the Milford, Conn.-based franchisor charges operators a base royalty of 8% of a store’s revenue—or $8 for every $100 in sales a location generat…</span>

                    <span>Elizabeth Warren Wants To Ban Lawmakers From Trading Individual Stocks

            
Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wants to end what is effectively legalized insider trading by members of Congress by barring them from trading individual stocks ever again.







Warren first attempted to push through similar legislation with the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act she introduced in 2018 and then again in 2020. Both bills unsurprisingly died in the Senate Finance Committee, which Warren sits on.


The renewed push comes as several members of Congress have come under recent scrutiny for profitable stock trades in recent months, according to Business Insider. The include Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC), Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) and former Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler…</span>

“Beliefs aren’t facts.” 


That would be an unremarkable title for an unremarkable column except for who wrote it. In a new column in Persuasion, Northwestern University President Morton Schapiro took on the illiberal tyranny that permeates most of higher education.


Schapiro, you may remember, is the one who told his incoming freshmen to “look for safe spaces” and pledged that “if you can’t find them, we will help you find them.” Regarding traumatic ideas, Schapiro said, “If they say that…you shouldn’t be warned to prepare yourself psychologically for that, that somehow that’s coddling, those people are lunatics.” As for micr…</span>

Oil prices ended marginally lower after a choppy day of investors tempering expectations of an early return of oil exporter Iran to international crude markets (bullish) and US virus cases falling rapidly ahead of Memorial Day travels (bullish) battling with the overall weakness in economic data and slop in US equity markets and lower bond yields (bearish).



&quot;Oil prices... remain at high levels as the high season for oil demand is approaching and as restrictions are lifted in much of Europe and the United States,&quot; said Louise Dickson, oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy.



The swings in crude and product stocks in the last couple of weeks have been noisy thanks to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown. This week we should start to put that behind us, although product stocks may still be impacted.

&quot;Crude prices are in wait-and-see mode until the fifth round of negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal are done,&quot; said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, noting &quot;Energy traders need to know how much Iranian crude is going to hit the market.&quot;



Iran may have some 69 million barrels of oil in floating storage waiting on tankers to travel to buyers when U.S. sanctions on its crude oil exports are removed, estimates from E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers cited by Bloomberg showed on Tuesday.

Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont is fed up with Progressive tax hikes, and rightfully so.







Connecticut Taxes




	
Capital gains are taxed as regular income, with rates up to 6.99% (Twelfth highest)

The day started off with an exuberant buying-panic in Small Caps at the US cash open (as the rest of the majors were sold). That lasted around 12 minutes before Small Caps reversed that maniacal spike and everything accelerated into the red and beyond into the European close. A brief bounce ensued, only for that rip to be sold and as the old &quot;WSB&quot; names started to rise, so Small Caps and the rest of the major indices tumbled in the last hour. Nasdaq managed to close green, none of the other majors did with Small Caps the laggards (from up 1% at the open to down 1% at the close)

Authored by Ron Paul via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace &amp; Prosperity,


In March, Governor Greg Abbott announced that Texas would open for business 100 percent without a statewide mask mandate. 







The pro-lockdown “experts” were shocked. If a state as big as Texas joined Florida and succeeded in thumbing its nose at “the science” – which told us that for the first time in history healthy people should be forced to stay in their houses and wear oxygen-restricting face masks – then the lockdown narrative would begin falling apart.


President Biden famously attacked the decision as “Neanderthal thinking.” Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa warned that, with this order, Abbott would “kill Texans.” Incoming CDC Dire…</span>

SPACs have officially fallen out of favor. 


The SPAC bubble burst started with fallen angel Nikola Motors and has since continued, with short sellers and market skeptics unveiling the less than savory elements to numerous names brought public through the merger-style transaction that allows companies to go public quicker, and with less red tape, than the traditional IPO process.


Chamath Palihapitiya, once heralded as the &quot;king of SPACs&quot; is now more likely to be seen as the face of a SPAC bubble that looks as though it is in the process of popping. 


As a result of the bubble bursting, banks are starting to &quot;pass&quot; on funding SPAC transactions. One recent example was Si…</span>

Don&#x27;t look now but the meme stocks are back.


Having crept higher in recent days, both Gamestop and AMC, the two most popular meme stocks which shook the hedge fund industry in February when several prominent hedge funds suffered massive losses on their shorts, have exploded higher today, with GME up as much as 18%...







... and AMC close behind, up 14%.







The move may be a ramp in sympathy because while GME short interest is a pale shadow of its former glorious self...







... AMC&#x27;s short interest has soared back to all time highs.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken&#x27;s Mideast trip where he first met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Tuesday was supposed to focus on maintaining the Israel-Gaza truce and finding a lasting solution toward preventing a future flair up of violence. 


However, an emboldened Netanyahu bluntly shared his thoughts on the impending restoration of the Iran nuclear deal while standing next to Blinken during the press conference that followed their meeting. As expected Netanyahu urged the US to stay away from the deal, forcing Blinken to quickly contradict the Israeli leader, leading to an awkward exchange among the close allies. It took a mere 90 seconds for Netanyahu…</span>

Authored by Gary Galles via The Mises Institute,


It seems that every time something adverse happens in the labor market, it restarts the partisan battle between those currently in and out of power as to who is a better steward of the economy.







That was illustrated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics&#x27;s (BLS) release of the job numbers for April, which made headlines when job growth, which was expected to surge, came in “unexpectedly” low. The 266,000 jobs created were only a quarter of some forecasts, which topped 1 million. Further, March job creation was also revised down by 146,000. And unemployment ticked up for the first time since the lockdown, despite a reportedly massive shortage of workers, as illustrated b…</span>

At an event outside a US Micron Technology Inc chip factory on Monday, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told an audience that a proposed bill on Capitol Hill for $52 billion could bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing by funding seven to 10 new US factories, according to Reuters.







Raimondo told the audience in a tented event outside of Micron&#x27;s Manassas, Virginia, chip factory that she expects the $52 billion proposal to enhance US competitiveness with China would generate &quot;$150 billion-plus&quot; in investment for chip manufacturing and research from state and federal governments and private-sector firms.

Let&#x27;s explore quantum computing, problems it might solve, and what it will do to current security protocols and blockchain.







What is a Quantum Computer?


The New Scientist answers the question What is a Quantum Computer?



Classical computers, which include smartphones and laptops, encode information in binary “bits” that can either be 0s or 1s. In a quantum computer, the basic unit of memory is a quantum bit or qubit.


For instance, eight bits is enough for a classical computer to represent any number between 0 and 255. But eight qubits is enough for a quantum computer to represent every number between 0 and 255 at the same…</span>

What started as a birthday party in Huntington Beach, California, quickly descended into chaos over the weekend. 


A TikTok video promoting a birthday party went viral, and thousands of people showed up on the beach and in the streets Saturday night. Riot police were called as the unruly crowd launched fireworks and threw rocks and bottles. An emergency curfew was implemented through early Sunday with 150 arrests. 







A TikTok post (now taken down) called Adrian&#x27;s Kickback by user &quot;adrian.lopez517&quot; swelled to more than 2,500 people on Saturday night. In the days before the meetup, the post went absolutely viral, gaining more than 200 million views on the app.

&quot;In real terms, home prices have never been so high. My data goes back over 100 years, so this is something,&quot; Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller told CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Trading Nation.&quot; 


Shiller is the co-founder of the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price index. He is worried about a housing bubble forming where the &quot;Wild West&quot; mentality pushes prices higher. He also is concerned about stocks and cryptocurrencies.







 &quot;I don&#x27;t think that the whole thing is explained by central bank policy. There is something about the sociology of markets that are happening,&quot; he said. 


Shiller has noticed that housing starts drive home prices. But last week, despite a shortage of homes and buildable prope…</span>

The news business just can’t stop clowning itself. The latest indignity is an international fact-checking debacle originating, of all places, at a “festival of fact-checking.”


The soul of rectitude testifies in the Senate


The Poynter Institute is perhaps the most respected think tank in our business, an organization seeking to “fortify journalism’s role in a free society,” among other things through its sponsorship of the fact-checking outlet PolitiFact. A few weeks back, it held a virtual convention called the “United Facts of America: A Festival of Fact-Checking.”

There was a ton of hype last week when Ford Motor Company unveiled its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck. As of Friday, Ford secured more than 44,000 reservations for the new truck. 


Ford&#x27;s first all-electric truck is expected to have a targeted range between 230 and 300 miles depending on the version the customer chooses. Ford said the truck could haul up to 10,000 pounds. 







Auto blog Jalopnik points out that Ford failed to release data on how hauling or towing would affect range last week. 


In an emailed response, Vice News had a similar question and asked a Ford spokeswoman.

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


Despite relentless positive promotion by the media and political elites, support for Black Lives Matter in America has dropped to a two year low.







An essay written by academics Jennifer Chudy and Hakeem Jefferson published by the New York Times analyzes how support for BLM soared to +20% in mid-2020 but rapidly dropped to only +5% – which is where it was in mid-2019.


The authors note that the figures serve to contradict “the idea that the country underwent a racial reckoning.”

Via Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com,


Economist John Williams, founder of ShadowStats.com, says the Federal Reserve has painted itself into such a tight corner with the economy it really has only two choices.  Williams says it comes down to “Inflation or Implosion.”







What would happen to the financial system if the Fed stopped printing massive amounts of money for stimulus and debt service?  Williams explains,



“You could see financial implosion by preventing liquidity being put into the system.  The system needs liquidity (freshly created dollars) to function. Without that liquidity, you would see more of an economic implosion than you have already seen.  In fact, I will contend that…</span>

President Biden, a self-described &#x27;devout Catholic,&#x27; will become the first US official in two decades not to attend Notre Dame&#x27;s commencement ceremony, citing a &#x27;scheduling conflict&#x27; according to the Catholic News Agency.







The news comes after 4,600 &quot;members of the Notre Dame community&quot; signed a petition urging college president Fr. John Jenkins not to invite Biden - the second Roman Catholic president, over his stance on abortion, according to Fox News. Of note, Biden was told in February by US Archbishop Joseph Naumann to stop calling himself a &#x27;devout catholic&#x27; over his pro-abortion views.

Thanks to its very name - renewable energy - we can picture a time in the not-too-distant future when our need for non-renewable fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal will vanish. Indeed, the Biden administration has announced a breakthrough target of 2035 for fully eliminating U.S. reliance on those non-renewable fuels for the generation of electricity. That would be accomplished by “deploying carbon-pollution-free electricity-generating resources,” primarily the everlasting power of the wind and sun.


With other nations moving in a similar direction, it’s tempting to conclude that the days when competition over finite supplies of energy was a recurring so…</span>

There&#x27;s a lot of noise from the Biden administration, who claim to be addressing gun violence as an epidemic, but their efforts have only been for optics, as very little action has been taken so far. This past weekend, a dozen mass shootings were recorded across the country, according to CNN. 


Nonprofit research group Gun Violence Archive (GVA) reported that at least 12 mass shootings were observed in eight states, including Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia, Texas, and Minnesota.



This is the second straight year that the month of May has had 60+ mass shootings. https://t.co/xUBTCOf9xW

Left-wing website website Vox has been caught stealth editing an old article from March 2020 “debunking” the lab origin of COVID following numerous prominent officials now saying the lab origin is a distinct possibility.

Writer and investor Paul Graham documented the edits, tweeting, “Some of the stealth edits that Vox made to its article debunking “conspiracy theories” that Covid-19 originated in a lab leak between its original publication in March 2020 and now.”


The edits include removing the words that the virus definitively did “not come from the Wuhan lab” and saying that the fact the virus emerged in the sam…</span>

A growing number of European carriers, including all airlines based in the United Kingdom, are now avoiding entry into Belarus&#x27; airspace following Sunday&#x27;s dramatic events involving the diversion of a Ryanair flight carrying Belarusian opposition journalist Roman Pratasevich.


The BBC is confirming that &quot;The UK government has told airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace after a Ryanair flight was diverted to Minsk and an opposition journalist arrested.&quot; The government said this is necessary &quot;to keep passengers safe&quot;.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Below is my column in The Hill on the recent decision of a federal judge that the Biden Administration was engaged in racial and gender discrimination in the administration of the pandemic relief under the American Rescue Plan Act. It is a question that is now being raised in a variety of federal programs under the Biden Administration.







President Biden has spoken out often, eloquently and passionately against the “ugly poison” of discrimination and racism in our government. So a ruling by a federal district court in Texas this week was particularly jarring: Judge Reed O’Connor found that the Biden administration engaged…</span>

                    <span>Ron Paul: Fed Inflation Is Propping Up Big Government Spending

            
Via SchiffGold.com,


Inflation came in hot in April. Initially gold sold off on the news. But over the following week, there appears to have been something of a pivot in the market. Gold and the dollar both started behaving as one would expect in an inflationary environment. Peter Schiff said it looks like investors are starting to worry the Fed won’t fight inflation after all.







The markets have been by and large operating on the assumption that the Fed would stick to its playbook and tighten monetary policy to deal with increasing consumer prices. But Peter has been saying there is no way the Fed could fight inflation if it wants to. Inflation is propping up the economy. If the Fed raised rates and…</span>

The White House on Monday deflected after Fox News&#x27; Peter Doocy put spox Jen Psaki on the spot following a Wall Street Journal report that three workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell ill with COVID-19 symptoms in December of 2019, bolstering the lab-leak theory for the origins of the pandemic.







&quot;Why isn&#x27;t President Biden pushing for more access, more information to get to the bottom of exactly what happened,&quot; asked Doocy.


&quot;We are,&quot; replied Psaki, adding &quot;and we have repeatedly called for the WHO to support an expert-driven evaluation of the origins. During that first phase of the investigation there was not access to data, there was not information provided. And now we&#x27;re hopeful that WH…</span>

Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,


The Biden Administration is discussing hiking corporate taxes to pay for the proposed infrastructure spending package. While the goal is to ensure the “rich pay their fair share,” a look at history suggests changing tax rates will have very little impact on economic outcomes.


Leading up to, and following, the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Trump Tax Cuts) I wrote a lot of analysis on:




	
The fallacy of tax cuts,

	

	

	
Why tax cuts wouldn’t change corporate behavior; and,

	

	

	
How tax cuts are an ineffective method of improving economic prosperity.

	


What we know now, is that our analysis was correct. As noted, corporate behavi…</span>

                    <span>New York City Is Back: At Least 30 People Shot Over The Weekend

            
New York City is officially back: almost 30 people were shot in New York City this past weekend - and that number was only up until about 2PM on Sunday. 


29 victims in total had been struck by gunfire by early evening Sunday, according to the New York Post, with one reported fatality. 


“These kids are having running gun battles and innocents are getting shot,” one veteran NYPD officer told the Post. “Nobody is interested in hearing how many shots are fired but if people knew how many shootings occurred where there are no victims — it’s by the grace of God.&quot;


Among those struck by gunfire over the weekend were a Manhattan federal prosecutor, Mollie Bracewell, who was dining outside in Brooklyn’s Prospect Heights, and Benjamin Bustamante, an innocent bystander walking nearby. 







The weekend hadn&#x27;t even ended before one officer said &quot;there were just two more right now&quot;, referring to additional shootings late Sunday. 


Shootings took place at Beach 30th Street and Seagirt Boulevard in Far Rockaway, Queens, among other locations throughout the city.


Two people were shot in that area after a &quot;gang dispute&quot; spilled out of a nearby park, the report says. 


And if &quot;diversity&quot; in your violent crimes is a major concern, as we know it probably is for Mayor De Blasio, it should be noted that in addition to the shootings, there was a fatal stabbing in Northern Brooklyn and a man who was beaten to death in the Northeast Bronx over the weekend as well.

Submitted by Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research


The inflation of the 1970s/early 1980s is a big topic just now, but a deep dive into the historical CPI data shows the world was very different then. The CPI peak in 1974 felt awful because food/clothing was 33 pct of the index and prices were up 8-12 pct. Those items are just 14 pct of CPI now. May 1980’s 13-14 pct CPI inflation was driven by high mortgage rates, no longer even used in CPI. Bottom line: look forward, not backwards, and consider energy stocks, gold, “B”, and even US stocks as inflation hedges.

                    <span>US State Dept Issues &quot;Do Not Travel&quot; Advisory For Japan As Calls To Cancel Olympics Intensify

            
Update (1340ET): Shortly after the warnings from Masa-san and news (below) of Japan&#x27;s push for a amass vaccination program, the US State Department has cranked up the pressure to &#x27;11&#x27; by issuing a Level 4 Travel Advisory for visitors to Japan.


&quot;Do not travel to Japan due to COVID-19.&quot;







The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 4 Travel Health Notice for Japan due to COVID-19, indicating a very high level of COVID-19 in the country. There are restrictions in place affecting U.S. citizen entry into Japan. Visit the Embassy&#x27;s COVID-19 page for more information on COVID-19 in Japan.

                    <span>How A $1 Billion Cryptocurrency Fund Is Trading The Crash

            
Back in December, vol-specialist hedge fund One River Asset Management surprised its peers when long before Elon Musk arrived on  the scene, it became one of the first major asset managers to disclose it had purchased $600 million in bitcoin and ethereum and said it would own more than $1 billion in cryptos in early 2021. It wasn&#x27;t along in this pioneering effort: Brevan Howard Asset Management co-founder Alan Howard had taken an ownership stake in One River Digital and was helping provide the company with backend trading services. Another prominent backer was British hedge fund Ruffer, which last December also revealed that 2.5% of its total AUM were in bitcoin.

                    <span>David Rosenberg: &quot;A Whole Bunch Of People Are Really, Really Wrong&quot; About Inflation

            
With so much focus on the macro environment as stocks struggle to return to their all-time highs, MacroVoices invited seasoned Wall Street economist David Rosenberg, the chief economist and chief strategist of Rosenberg Research, on the show this week to discus the market&#x27;s topic du jour: inflation, and whether or not it will be &quot;transitory,&quot; like the Federal Reserve says.


What followed was a thorough critique from Rosenberg, who just a couple of months ago was warning that rising Treasury yields would soon push the market to a &quot;breaking point,&quot; of what he sees as flaws in the market&#x27;s pricing of lasting inflationary pressures.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced this weekend that he will not get vaccinated against COVID-19, explaining that he already contracted the virus last year and has “natural immunity.”







Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, said that he has not seen evidence proving the vaccine is more effective than having survived the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, otherwise known as the novel coronavirus, so he won’t get the shot.



“Until they show me evidence that people who have already had the infection are dying in large numbers, or being hospitalized or getting very sick, I just made my own personal decision that I’m not getting vaccinated because I’ve al…</span>

Confirming that &quot;selling in May&quot; is there for a reason, virtually every bank has turned cautious if not outright downbeat on the market following a blockbuster earnings season when despite record earnings beats, the S&amp;P is down compared to where it was a month ago. So now that Wall Street is back to its favorite activity of &quot;explaining&quot; events after the fact, here is Goldman strategist Chris Hussey listing the three key &quot;grey rhino&quot; events the market is grappling with.


As Hussey writes in the &quot;end of week&quot; market intel note, &quot;gray rhino&quot; risks have proliferated around markets this week, helping to sustain the tepid return range that the S&amp;P 500 has been stuck in all of May (now down 0.2% mtd). Incidentally, for t…</span>

The world’s worst disaster in a century killed 7.1mm-12.7mm across the planet. The total continued rising. No one knew exactly when it would end, only that the poorest nations would bear the brunt. They always do. European and Asian countries lost more citizens than they had since WWII. The US lost more than in any war. Children fell behind. Economic costs spiraled, leaving each nation’s finances forever changed. Monetary and fiscal policy merged in the West. Inflation reappeared. Despots tightened their grip. America’s president was voted out.

Glenn Kelman, CEO at Redfin, spoke with Bloomberg Radio&#x27;s Denise Pellegrini on Wednesday about the state of the US housing market. He said the latest surge in home prices could subside. 


Kelman said the housing market is a frenzy, with most houses selling above the asking prices, which has never happened before. 


After record gains in the first quarter, some home prices are likely to stall. 


Nationwide, the median existing-home sales price rose 16.2% in the first quarter to $319,200, a record high in data going back to 1989, according to the National Association of Realtors.

                    <span>Apples-to-Apples, Consumer Price Inflation Is Nearing 1970-Type Numbers

            
By Joseph Carson, former chief economist at Alliance Bernstein


Apples-to-apples, consumer price inflation nowadays is running close to the high inflation readings of the late 1970s. That should be a red flag for policymakers as monetary decisions are focused on actual outcomes, not forecasted. But reported inflation statistics do not show the 1970s inflation-style inflation because they no longer include actual house prices.


The old consumer price index included house prices in measuring the owner&#x27;s housing cost, whereas the present-day price index base owners&#x27; housing cost on an arbitrary, non-market rent measure. The only way to make a price series strictly comparable over time is to use the s…</span>

Three researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were so sick in November of 2019 that they sought hospitalization, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing a previously undisclosed US intelligence report &quot;that could add weight to growing calls for a fuller probe of whether the COVID-19 virus may have escaped from the laboratory.&quot;

All Gas, No Brakes


The weather in London this week has been rainy while sunny, which feels like a fair description of current sentiment, as we’ve been discussing our mid-year outlook with investors this week. There’s a wide range of views out there at the moment, with the noisiness of the data giving everyone something to hang their hat on. In short, it’s the perfect time to step back and debate the longer-term outlook.


The most notable aspect of our forecasts, and one of the most contentious areas of debate, is just how much our expectations differ from the prior decade. The post-GFC period was defined by fiscal aust…</span>

                    <span>Fauci Finally Admits COVID-19 May Have Come From Wuhan Lab, &#x27;Not Convinced&#x27; Of Natural Origin

            
Earlier this month, just hours after Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) dragged Anthony Fauci over pandemic misinformation - and the fact that Fauci&#x27;s NIH funded risky collaborations at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - the nation&#x27;s top virologist (and highest-paid government employee) furiously backpedaled over the origins of the pandemic in what we can only assume was an effort to redirect attention from his own culpability.







Recall that since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, Fauci parroted CCP talking points - insisting that the virus couldn&#x27;t possibly have come from a Chinese lab.

                    <span>Basel III &amp; The New Role For Gold

            
Authored by Tom Luongo via Gold, Goats, &#x27;n Guns blog,


Last week both Martin Armstrong and Alistair MacLeod wrote about the changes to the Basel III rules and how they will greatly affect the physical and paper gold markets if implemented in their current form.


MacLeod’s article from last week is an excellent primer on the definitions and inner workings of the rules, the gold market and the changes to the rules.  The short redux is that the advantage to using unallocated accounts, savings accounts which are linked to gold by holding futures contracts, will end.


We’ve discussed parts of this in the past.  The process of creating fake supply to control the price of gold is on the line with these rule changes.

                    <span>Study Finds 4.5% Of All Bitcoin Mining Is In Sanctions-Hit Iran

            
A prominent crypto analytics firm has issued a new report suggesting the Islamic Republic was able to successfully weather the Trump-era sanctions storm of the past few years by generating up to a billion dollars a year through mining cryptocurrencies. 


Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic concluded that a whopping 4.5% of all global bitcoin mining takes place in Iran alone. The Iranian government itself has acknowledged these attempts to beat the near total economic embargo on the country, which has been in effect and progressively ramped up since Trump pulled out of the Obama-era JCPOA nuclear deal in May 2018.

The cost of living numbers prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are highly misleading. Currently, the government understates inflation by using a formula based on the concept of a “constant level of satisfaction” that evolved during the first half of the 20th century in academia. This extended into the BLS re-weightings sales outlets such as discount or mass merchandisers with Main Street shops. Those promoting this change claimed it was simply another way to measure inflation and it still reflected the true cost of living.  







The fact is, politicians and those behind this system created it as a way to reduce the cost of living adjustments for governme…</span>

It appears that Iran may be applying some last-minute leverage just ahead of the final round of nuclear talks in Vienna, and at a moment it&#x27;s being widely reported that the main parties, including the US, are on the cusp of agreeing on a deal as final documents are being drafted. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Sunday announced that IAEA inspectors will no longer have access to surveillance images of the country&#x27;s nuclear sites. 


&quot;From May 22 and with the end of the three-month agreement, the agency will have no access to data collected by cameras inside the nuclear facilities agreed under the agreement,&quot; Qalibaf said as announced in state television.

Authored by Christopher Whalen via TheInstitutionalRiskAnalyst.com,


Back in 2019, we published a post in The Institutional Risk Analyst called “Nationalizing the Federal Funds Market,” that talked about the increasingly overt actions of the Federal Open Market Committee in the market for short-term funding.


Then as now, we view the actions of the FOMC as slowly destroying the private money markets in the US and preparing to very visibly push the big banks out of the transmission chain of monetary policy.

Last week, when cryptos again plunged on the well-timed recurring &quot;news&quot; report that China was again banning crypto - something China has been doing with zero success since 2014 but has taken on new urgency now that its Digital Yuan has emerged as a total flop - this time in the format of cracking down in Proof-of-Work (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0) crypto miners, we said that this could be the best thing to happen for crypto: after all, the China was and is the bitcoin bears biggest friend: as long as bitcoin is mostly mined in China, where coal power plants account for most of electrical generation, bitcoin will remain &quot;dirty&quot; and give the ESG fanatics ammo to criticize bitcoin.

Authored by Cara Ding via The Epoch Times,


Chicago’s largest police union on Wednesday issued a vote of no confidence against Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown.







The vote came during a Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) meeting where police officers vented their frustrations, new and old, with the mayor and and the police department, Chicago FOP president John Catanzara told The Epoch Times.


Emotions were running high, Catanzara said, and one member grabbed the microphone to suggest a vote of no confidence. All members present at the meeting, about 150 active and retired police officers, voted for it.

A bizarre and alarming incident which officials are calling unprecedented unfolded over the skies of Eastern Europe on Sunday. A Ryanair flight which had departed Athens and was en route to Vilnius - the capital of Lithuania - was forced to land in Belarus to allow state intelligence and security services to detain a journalist who&#x27;s long been critical of President Alexander Lukashenko.


Bloomberg has identified the detained journalist is Raman Pratasevich, described as &quot;the former editor-in-chief of the most popular Telegram news channel in Belarus&quot; who was &quot;arrested in the Minsk airport after the plane landed, according to the Minsk-based human rights center Viasna, which…</span>

It&#x27;s never just one thing. This week Elon Musk, China, and pipeline cyber attackers all contributed to another crash, but, as Decrypt&#x27;s Jeff John Roberts details below, there&#x27;s cause for optimism.


It began with Elon Musk bashing Bitcoin, and ended with a renewed crypto crackdown in China. Those came as book-ends to a spate of other bad news in cryptoland, including a stomach-churning market crash and anger over Bitcoin&#x27;s role in facilitating a massive cyber attack on an east coast oil pipeline. All of this saw Bitcoin limp into the weekend well below the $40,000 mark as the entire crypto industry licked its wounds.


And this weekend has seen the losses accelerate further with Bitcoin back below $34k..…</span>

Transitory or not transitory, that is the question.


The challenges from cracking supply-chains and the resulting strain on production and inventory are being felt widely. If you are looking to furnish a home, you have probably dealt with major delays in the delivery of your new sofa and may instead be sitting on beanbags. If you are looking to buy a car, you might be walking out with the sticker price and the wrong color. And good luck if you are trying to rent a car: if only Hertz had waited a year to file for bankruptcy it would be worth tens of billions today.

Market Review &amp; Update


After another rough start to the week, the bulls finally showed up and flipped our “money flow” indicators back to a buy signal. As we stated last week:



“Well, that follow-through failed to occur.Not only did the “buy signal” not trigger, but the market also broke down through the previous consolidation range. As I said, it did not work out as planned. The last exposure we took on is now pressuring the portfolio momentarily, but we should benefit from the turn if we are correct.”

New policies will artificially deflate “breakthrough infections” in the vaccinated, while the old rules continue to inflate case numbers in the unvaccinated.







The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) is altering its practices of data logging and testing for “Covid19” in order to make it seem the experimental gene-therapy “vaccines” are effective at preventing the alleged disease.


They made no secret of this, announcing the policy changes on their website in late April/early May, (though naturally without admitting the fairly obvious motivation behind the change).

Three Markets topics to discuss today:


Issue #1: What are US markets trying to tell us? It would be tempting to say “Nothing” … That we’re only 3 percent off the S&amp;P 500’s record close of 4,233, set all of 8 trading days ago. That there’s plenty of good news to come. That Europe is just now reopening … All these are true, but they are also broadly known and therefore already in asset prices.

Some of the world&#x27;s rarest cacti are found in the deserts of South America. A recent raid in Italy uncovered a smuggling network of thorny succulents, according to NYTimes. 


The year&#x27;s long operation, dubbed &quot;Operation Atacama,&quot; was a collaborative effort that began in February 2020 by Italian and Chilean authorities to return some of the rarest cacti to Chile.

Authored by Brian McGlinchey via Stark Realities,


The Center for Disease Control’s major easing of its mask-use recommendations was a welcome development, giving Americans hope that logic can triumph over the CDC’s bureaucratic inertia and its Covid-era tendency to push the most severe restrictions on human activity at every turn.


Next, let’s hope this outbreak of rationality proves contagious within the CDC, and …</span>

Lava from the Mount Nyiragongo volcano in the eastern part of sub-Saharan African country is spewing into the night sky. Panicked residents of Goma, a city of 2 million people located 6 miles from the volcano, are being evacuated.

Authored by Robert Murphy via The Mises Institute,


With the possible exception of international trade, no topic in economics contains more myths than monetary theory. 







In the present article I address four popular opinions concerning money that suffer from either ambiguity or outright falsehood.


One: &quot;Money represents a claim on goods and services.&quot;


Although there is a grain of truth in this view, it is quite simplistic …</span>

Around 10:40 a.m. Saturday Beijing time, China&#x27;s first Mars rover officially drove down its landing platform ramp and began roaming the Red Planet, China National Space Administration (CNSA) said. 


CNSA release another photograph (here&#x27;s the first) of the rover, called Zhurong, which touched down in the southern part of Utopia Planitia, a large plain on the northern hemisphere of Mars, last Saturday.

As President Joe Biden considers forgiving $10,000 in student debt per borrower and ending tuition for many students at public colleges, it is worth noting that college graduates already have not paid $435 billion back to the federal government.


That’s right, of the government’s $1.4 trillion student loan portfolio, almost one-third is unpaid.

At the same time we take one step forward from government overreach and Covid panic, with the CDC finally ending its mask mandate, it feels like we&#x27;re taking two steps back, as the desperation to get literally every single person on Earth vaccinated still feels more and more palpable - even as the nation nears 50% of its population having at least one dose of the vaccine already.

Millions of people in the Middle East were shocked after witnessing a rare security incident during a live broadcast of the sermon at Mecca&#x27;s Great Mosque on Friday. Mecca is considered the holiest place in the Islamic world, and in recent years security has been greatly beefed up amid the continued influx of millions of pilgrims weekly, but also amid increasing threats and incidents.

There&#x27;s no doubt that Elon Musk is currently at the center of the Bitcoin universe.


It was Musk&#x27;s public critiquing of Bitcoin mining&#x27;s environmental impact that started a chain of events that led to Bitcoin crashing last week, before eventually steadying and paring some of its losses.

The French version of Michael Lewis’ book The Big Short is intitled Le casse du siècle, which literally means the “heist of the century.” This idea is interesting, as going short can be regarded as finding the weak points of the financial system and hacking into it.

Tulsi Gabbard has called for Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) to resign over &quot;blatant anti-white racism&quot; for announcing that she would only grant one-on-one interviews to &quot;black and brown&quot; reporters.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


The Biden Administration has emphasized racial and gender prioritization in a variety of programs from vaccinations to pandemic relief. One such program doled out billions to restaurants based on racial and gender priorities that were challenged in various lawsuits.

On Monday, The Washington Post’s media reporter Paul Farhi contacted me to say that he had spoken with numerous editors and journalists at The Intercept, who voiced to him a wide range of personal and professional accusations about me.

When seeking somewhat comparable historical analogues to the current unprecedented period in capital markets, Bank of America&#x27;s Michael Hartnett writes in his latest Flow Show that bulls can point to 2017/18, strong growth, range-bound yields, dithering Fed, and await the final melt-up... while bears point to 2007/8, as a sinister series of deleveraging “events” ended with a “Minsky Moment.&quot;

Scams, frauds, flim flams, and grifts are nothing new to America. In fact, confidence games were old hat when Clifton Wooldridge published his 1906 classic, The Grafters of America: Who They Are and How They Work, which describes common cons in fin de siecle Chicago. The recent death of notorious investment scamster Bernie Madoff should remind Americans that if it sounds too good to …</span>

This looks like bad news for the CDC and the Biden Administration, which are desperate to entice more Americans to get vaccinated before international pressure forces the president to give away the entire US stock of vaccines (Biden announced yesterday that the US would send 20MM doses of vaccine that are authorized for emergency use in the US abroad for the first time as pressure from the international c…</span>

You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows. You also don’t need an economist to know what happens when the government pays people to stay home. Unemployment rose to 6.1% in April despite thousands of U.S. businesses desperate to hire — especially in the restaurant and hospitality industries.

While this was in keeping with Wood&#x27;s traditionally hyperbolic forecasts (like Tesla to $3,000 for example), one could make the argument that at least in 2020, the market did give Wood…</span>

Authored by J. Peder Zane via RealClearPolitics.com,


The Biden administration is vigorously pursuing key figures from the phony Trump/Russia collusion scandal that roiled the nation for four years. But instead of trying to punish the liars who perpetrated that fraud, it is targeting the truth-tellers who challenged and exposed the conspiracy to negate the 2016 election.

Republican governors in nearly half of US states have all announced plans to scrap beefed-up federal unemployment benefits they say have disincentivized workers to reenter the workforce.

The lockdowns implemented to curb the transmission of COVID-19 in the United States and across the globe have not only been a “heinous abuse of power,” but they have also failed to protect the elderly and vulnerable, according to former White House COVID-19 adviser Dr. Scott Atlas.

House Democrats&#x27; $1.9 billion virtue-signaling bill to beef up Capitol Security was almost derailed by progressive members of their own party on Thursday, after several members of &quot;the squad&quot; voted &quot;no&quot; - while three voted &quot;present&quot; - leading to a razor-thin passage by a 213-212 vote.

After yesterday&#x27;s bloodbathery, today was the big bounce back. Big-tech had bounced off the intraday lows yesterday to end unchanged and were violently panic-bid from the cash open today (only briefly stalled in their gamma-squeeze surge into tomorrow&#x27;s opex by a brief interruption as Yellen tanked crypto). Nasdaq ended up over 2% today (and up 4% from yesterday lows ahead of the cash open). The S&amp;P er…</span>

My intent is not to target Cathie Wood or the ARK team personally. I very much enjoy their work, think their analysts are incredibly unique thinkers, and have enjoyed learning from them over the years. But Cathie&#x27;s commentary on bitcoin yesterday is easily, verifiably false and demands a fact-check.

There&#x27;s no question that the SPAC frenzy has slowed substantially from its frenzied peak late last year, but even as the pace of dealmaking has slowed (giving weary junior investment-banking analysts a rest), there&#x27;s little question that the SPAC trend has changed the nature of dealmaking, especially for Private Equity firms, as Institutional Investor pointed out.

Election officials in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, reported issues with voting equipment at polling places on Tuesday, prompting a response from Dominion Voting Systems saying that there was a ballot screen error regarding the viewing screen’s header.

As expected, today&#x27;s overnight reverse repo facility usage soared above $300 billion, surging $57BN from $293BN on Wednesday to a whopping $351BN as 48 counterparties parked their reserves with the Fed in exchange for a 0.000% rate.







The surge in usage pushed the total to not only well above the Covid crisis high of $285BN, but was the fifth highest on record!

Semiconductor lead times, the time it takes for a company to order a chip and taking delivery, increased to 17 weeks in April, indicating shortages of these critical components are intensifying, according to Bloomberg. 


Companies that use semiconductors in their end products use lead times to gauge the balance between supply and demand. Rising levels suggest customers are racing to secure chips. If leads exponentially jump…</span>

By this point readers are more than familiar with the previously unthinkable infringements on our traditional rights and liberties due to “health and safety” lockdowns that the state has inflicted upon us over the last year.

Just under 20% of Seattle police have quit the force over the past year and a half, according to CBS News, citing the city&#x27;s interim Chief of Police.







The revelation comes after more than a year of violent clashes with anti-police protesters from BLM and Antifa, and a city council which has neutered the Seattle PD&#x27;s ability to use crowd control devices that social justice activists say didn&#x27;t go far enough.

A Johns Hopkins University medical professor said that closed schools are an “American disgrace.”

In today&#x27;s FOMC Minutes there was a brief section that received little focus amid the broader analysis of the Fed&#x27;s tapering, inflation language, yet which could be far more important in coming weeks in light of the violent move higher in overnight reverse repo usage.

“I can’t even think about how much money I just paid in interest,” 44 year old Jamie Johnson said, thinking back to a payday loan he took out in April 2020.


His $5,000 loan - which eventually accrued interest at a clip of up to 589% annualized - was the topic of a new Bloomberg article on payday and predatory lending.

The hits just keep coming. First, lumber prices exploded. Second, there was a terrible jobs report. Third, there was a gas shortage. These are all SAD stories–Supply And Demand. They are also, of course, stories about adaptation, adjustment, resilience, and unintended consequences.

                    <span>Texas Lawmakers Propose Annual Driving Tax For Tesla Owners  

            
Texas lawmakers have proposed Senate Bill 1728 (SB 1728) to slap Tesla owners with annual taxes between $240 and $400. Lawmakers claim EV owners need to &quot;pay their fair share&quot; and &quot;make up for&quot; fuel taxes they don&#x27;t pay at the pump that supports the state&#x27;s effort to modernize transportation infrastructure. 


The Tesla Owners Club of Austin said the bill consists of a $190 to $240 annual EV fee, scaled vehicle miles traveled fe…</span>

Real Vision senior editor Ash Bennington welcomes Tony Greer of TG Macro for a live Daily Briefing to analyze the tape and provide an update on his thoughts concerning the direction of inflation and the commodities trade. Greer touches on metals and mining as well as oil and discusses how likely it will be that inflation will become transitory based on last week’s CPI print.

Stocks are selling off again on Monday as worries about inflation persist, as the market is increasingly coming around to Morgan Stanley&#x27;s view that inflation will be an endemic phenomenon of the V-shaped recovery engineered by the Fed and federal government.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Podcast giant Joe Rogan has warned that the logical conclusion of ‘woke’ cancel culture is that all straight white men will be forbidden from talking or even leaving their own houses.

Once upon a time the Bank of America Fund Manager Survey served a useful indicator of what finance professionals did and thought. Then, over the years, it became a survey which revealed what the prevailing consensus narrative was  - if not what respondents actually did - as survey participants merely answered question in line with what they thought was the right answer.

As we detailed earlier, as Chileans overwhelmingly chose leftist and independent candidates for the country&#x27;s constitutional convention, the new non-free-market-friendly political regime is generating a lot of uncertainly in Chilean markets.

Late last week, amid a Slack-driven furor over his confessional memoir Chaos Monkeys, Apple fired ads engineer Antonio Garcia-Martinez. I wrote Friday about the specific hypocrisy of Apple’s move — the company has the author of Bitches Ain’t Shit on its board but claimed it fired Garcia-Martinez as a statement of its devotion to “inclusivity” — but over the wee…</span>

A former Jeffrey Epstein insider claims that Bill Gates was a regular at the notorious pedophile&#x27;s $77 million Manhattan townhouse, where Epstein held &quot;men&#x27;s club&quot; - type gatherings for his closest pals (documented by his home&#x27;s alleged network of spy cameras, we&#x27;re sure).

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


The White House Senior Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci stated Sunday that the coronavirus pandemic has revealed that the US is a fundamentally racist country.







Speaking to graduates of Emory University, Fauci declared that the virus has revealed the “undeniable effects of racism in our society.”

Summerlin, the suburb of west Las Vegas creeping ever closer to the mountains, looks to be crowded with fully paved streets, streetlights, block walls, and blue top lots. With lumber, labor, and other materials in short supply, home construction can’t keep up.

While everyone from the White House to the Fed has downplayed blistering inflation in just about everything as &#x27;transitory&#x27; as we emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, Democratic leaders are beginning to panic behind the scenes over its potential impact on the 2022 elections, where Democrats will have to defend slim majorities in both the House and Senate.

Donald Trump may not be president anymore, but that won&#x27;t stop Anitfa and BLM from getting their riot willies out this summer in response to any number of social justice triggers.

The housing market in America is not one but many markets that generally share a few common threads.

One of the oldest celebrations of the LGBTQ community in the world has been New York City’s annual Pride celebration. The parade began 51 years ago and has long been a symbol of the strength, defiance, and pride of this community. The whole idea was to show the full spectrum of LGBTQ influence, participation, and expression in our society. This year, however, activists have decided to discriminate agai…</span>

“Notably, the ‘money flow buy signal’ seemed to cross; however, we need some follow-through action on Monday to confirm. As shown, the uptick in money flows did allow us to add some exposure to portfolios in holdings we had taken profits in with the previous ‘sell’ signal.”

The nine campuses of the University of California system will no longer consider standardized testing scores as part of the admission process beginning in the fall of 2021.







The change is the result of a legal settlement (pdf) of a lawsuit brought by groups that claimed that the traditional SAT and ACT tests are racist.

By Chetan Ahya, Morgan Stanley&#x27;s Chief Economist and Global Head of Economics


A year ago, when the global economy was in the depths of the Great Covid-19 Recession, we argued for a V-shaped recovery and the return of inflation. 12 months on, deep scepticism has given way to broad agreement.


The debate now is whether the strong recovery and pick-up in inflation were just a spurt driven by policy support and reop…</span>

A US Space Force commander was reportedly relieved as commander of the 11th Space Warning Squadron &quot;due to loss of trust and confidence in his ability to lead,&quot; after he appeared on a podcast to promote his book which claims that the US military has been infiltrated by a neo-Marxist agenda which is transforming military culture and policy.

It seems DoubleLine&#x27;s Jeffrey Gundlach has had a change of heart regarding bitcoin. And while the cryptocurrency&#x27;s spectacular rise has mostly converted skeptics into believers (or reluctant investors inspired by FOMO), for Gundlach, it&#x27;s the other way around. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, the billionaire investor, who once said crypto could be a hedge against irresponsible monetary debasement by …</span>

Say it’s 2014 and you’ve had this idea for a technocratic Great Reset of the world economy for some time now, but it only works if the entire planet is rocked by a pandemic. How do you go about selling your idea?

In the modern digital world, social media reach is power.


The people with the most followers on Twitter, for example, have a massive platform to spread their messages, while those with large, engaged followings on Instagram are an advertiser’s dream sponsor partner.


Social media can also be an equalizer of power. As Visual Capitalist&#x27;s Omri Wallach notes, while it’s true that many celebrities boast large followings across platfo…</span>

In brief




	
Proof of stake is a consensus mechanism, which makes sure that only legitimate transactions get added to blocks.

	

	

	
It works by having validators lock up their cryptocurrency to secure the network.

As Americans warily eye new data showing both consumer and producer price inflation heating up beyond expectations, few of them realize the Federal Reserve has an explicit goal to relentlessly degrade the purchasing power of their savings.


The Fed weakens the dollar—and pushes prices higher—by creating new money and pushing it out into the economy. If the Fed hits its stated t…</span>

In any given year during the past decade in the United States, more than 2.5 million Americans have died - from all causes.


The number has grown in recent years, climbing from 2.59 million in 2013 to 2.85 million in 2019. This has been due partially to the US’s aging population, and also due to rising obesity levels and drug overdoses. In fact, since 2010, growth ra…</span>

Just over a month ago, in our preview of earnings season, we said that &quot;Q1 earnings will be stellar, but are fully priced in and only guidance will matter&quot;, and sure enough the broader market is now below where it was a month ago despite the strongest earnings season in modern history: with 90% of S&amp;P500 companies having reported, the results show EPS rose by 46% year/year...

The devious fellow was bemoaning evil capitalists for having the gall to use their own money for the express purpose of making more money.

Authored by Bryce Coward via Knowledge Leaders Capital blog,


This week saw some doozy inflation readings beginning on Wednesday with the CPI reading and then again on Thursday with the PPI. CPI came in at 4.2% year-over-year, but a whopping 0.8% month-over-month. For context, 0.8% MoM implies 10% annualized inflation! The PPI was also hot, coming in at 6.2% YoY and 0.6% MoM.

We&#x27;ve all experienced the intrusive moment when an advertisement has creepily shown up on our social media feed after talking about it. This is super annoying in a world where corporate America spies on users via smartphone sensors. What&#x27;s even more intrusive is Ford Motor Company&#x27;s new patent wants to use a vehicle&#x27;s camera to detect billboard advertisements then blast the information on its infotainment display.

I see the same question in forums, threads, articles and emails: what can I do to protect myself and my family from whatever lies ahead?


Given the uncertainties and extremes that are so evident, recognizing risk is a useful first step, a recognition that is very much out of fashion.

Despite widespread vaccination availability and even the U.S. CDC saying that vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks, Toronto has decided to cancel an entire summer&#x27;s worth of social functions.


The city has cancelled &quot;all major in-person events for a second straight summer,&quot; CBC reported on Friday.

Alongside some observations we made earlier on tech stocks vs commodities, Deutsche Bank credit strategist Jim Reid writes that while inflation and commodities have dominated the financial airways this week, &quot;although commodities prices have been a big part of the current inflation scare, they have actually dipped since the mid-week US CPI shock which has helped markets adjust to the high print&quot;, something else we pointed out earlier.

The COVID-19 pandemic had reached its apex, infecting a quarter of a million Americans every day. Yet, due to the discovery and distribution of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the incidence of infections had crested and was about to turn sharply down.

Authored by GQ Pan via The Epoch Times,


White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday said it is responsible for colleges to teach the idea that racism is embedded in the American system, dismissing criticism that such teaching aims at indoctrinating American youth.







In a White House press briefing, Psaki was asked about a proposed legislation by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) that would place an one …</span>

At the beginning of May, we noted that Taiwan Semiconductor was considering bolstering its production in the U.S., and that President Biden&#x27;s Commerce Secretary was urging more domestic production. Now, it looks like TSMC could be within striking distance of a serious U.S. expansion.

Authored by Greg Orman via RealClearPolitics.com,


President Biden spoke at the White House earlier this week to address an unsettling national trend – millions of jobs going unfilled in an economy still struggling to right itself. The president couldn’t deny the existence of the paradox: His own administration’s numbers show that millions of Americans are drawing unemployment while millions of jobs are going unfilled.

                    <span>Nasdaq Versus Commodities: This Ratio Suggest Critical Juncture Ahead  

            
With tech stocks tumbling in recent weeks amid surging inflation fears, at least the commodity sector appears safe from the global reflationary risk-off wave that swept across markets. Besides the ups and downs daily, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite has been on a tear for the last five years. But since commodities began to outperform earlier this year, Nasdaq year-to-date gains are flat.

Authored by David Stockman via Contra Corner blog,


There have been few politicians in modern times who have done more to undermine personal liberty, capitalist prosperity, small government and especially world peace than the Cheney Clan. So upon Liz Cheney’s ouster from the #3 job in the US House GOP hierarchy, we say: Good riddance!

Not that long ago, Bloomberg lauded Chamath Palihapitiya as the &quot;King of SPACs&quot; and the trendiest investor in America. Now, the financial news organization&#x27;s tone has changed, portraying him more like the pied piper who led an army of retail traders to their doom.

Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times,


American shoppers continued to flock to the nation’s malls in greater numbers in April, with the foot traffic gap nearly halving in just two months, reinforcing the view of a retail recovery gaining traction.

One customer, Lether Kerney, wasn&#x27;t paying attention when she pulled up to the BP gas station on Williamsburg Road - which was charging $5.99 per gallon - shortly before it…</span>

Thanks to the beneficence of the Internal Revenue Service—and the fallout from COVID-19—we half of Americans who pay federal income taxes have been given until May 17 to file.







Since I began earning enough to file Form 1040 and associated forms, I have only known one person who prepared his own taxes. That was Bill Archer, a Texas Republican who formerly headed the House Ways and Means Committee. I …</span>

                    <span>Disney Tumbles On Subscriber, Revenue Miss

            
After several impressive quarters of huge gains for its recently launched Disney+ subscription service, Disney couldn&#x27;t quite make it this time and moments ago the company reported Q1 earnings that beat on the bottom line but missed on revenues and subscribers, sending the stock sliding in after hours.


Here are the details: first the good news:



Adjusted EPS 79c, more than double the estimate of 32c

It was an erratic day, which in so many ways was a mirror image of yesterday, and even though today&#x27;s blistering PPI print confirmed yesterday&#x27;s near-record CPI number, traders who expected a continuation of yesterday&#x27;s action were left nursing big losses.


Perhaps it was the fervent defense of the &quot;transitory inflation&quot; narrative on Wall Street, but whatever the reason, yesterday&#x27;s surge in the VIX reversed…</span>

Bank of America&#x27;s economists have been on a roll in the past three months.


Back in February, the bank looked at its credit and debit card spending data and concluded that consensus was far, far too low, predicting that the stimmy-fueled January retail sales print would be above 4.1%.







Not only was BofA&#x27;s outlier forecast right, but the headline retail sales number came in even higher: at a whopping 5.3%, nearly 5x higher than the consensus …</span>

Senator Rand Paul continued to slam White House medical advisor Thursday, saying that Anthony Fauci could be culpable for the entire coronavirus pandemic.







Paul was attacked by leftist media Wednesday for merely questioning Fauci’s extensive role in granting funding to the Wuhan Institute of Virology at a Senate hearing.

As we noted earlier today, Musk&#x27;s public about-face on bitcoin due to its &quot;environmental impact&quot; over the last 24 hours has baffled many people, including almost all bitcoin enthusiasts who praised Musk earlier this year for accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for Tesla vehicles.

Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) centers around the notion that the economy in general, and money in particular, should be the creatures of the State.







It’s not a new idea – the meme has been around in one form or another since at least the days of Marx.

Authored by Michael Gartz via The American Institute for Economic Research,


The year 2020 generated several visible changes to the structure of our society. In the US, citizens migrated to different parts of the country, workers changed or lost jobs, and education became virtual. 







One thing, however, has not changed: despite expectations of a baby boom from idle couples locked down together, birth rates continue to fall. Birth rates were already…</span>

Chicago is a dangerous liberal-run city with recent crime statistics that show gun violence is out of control. One unlikely source of gun violence is three enlisted soldiers at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, who operated a gun smuggling operation into the metro area.

House Republicans voted to oust Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) as conference chair in a Wednesday morning vote, following months of brewing friction over her constant criticisms of former President Trump, according to Axios, citing two sources in the room.

The exotic animal reportedly belongs to a man named Victor Cuevas, who was out of jail on bond on an &quot;unrelated murder charge&quot;, according to local ABC affiliates. &quot;Cuevas is accused of shooting and killing a man in July 2017 and is out on a $125,0…</span>

The NRA was dealt a serious blow on Tuesday after a Texas judge tossed the gun rights organization&#x27;s bid to declare bankruptcy, saying it was filed in &quot;bad faith&quot; in an effort to dodge litigation in New York.


Judge Harlin Hale tossed the case after New York Attorney General Letitia James and others questioned how legitimate the January 15th bankruptcy filing was, according to a report by Law 360.

The three largest economies by GDP are the US, China, and Japan. These are also the largest country stock markets by aggregate market cap. By our count, US-headquartered stocks add up to $44T in equity value, Chinese (and Hong Kong) stocks add up to $17.3T, and Japanese stocks add up to $6.5T.

Authored by Isabel van Brugen via The Epoch Times,


Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) has signed into law legislation that designates gun stores as essential businesses allowed to remain open during an emergency—a move that will further protect gun stores, manufacturers, and trade associations from lawsuits.

The phenomenon of &quot;cancel culture&quot; is a toxic one metastasizing into a woke revolution war empowered by Big Tech and Big Business. Those unfamiliar with being canceled involve publicly shaming others and boycotting celebrities and companies. However, the art of canceling has progressed well beyond canceling public figures and is now used to garget average folks. The result can be devastating for ordinary people who may f…</span>

With Trump out of office and Biden now taking credit for all pandemic-related progress, several new studies - some of them picked up by MSM outlets, have significantly dialed back the fear (asymptomatic spread is less common than previously thought, surfaces are actually pretty safe, etc.).

Being contrarian is hard work. You need to withstand ridicule, the loss of friends, employment, and acquaintances, face the imminent possibility that most of the time you’ll be wrong, and abandon the warm fuzzy feeling of having your otherwise friendly peers confirming your bias.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he has officially scheduled a vote for Wednesday to oust House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) from her post, soon after he endorsed Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) for the No. 3 leadership spot.

The sexual harassment investigation against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) has widened in scope, as the state AG&#x27;s office has begun looking into whether a top Cuomo adviser linked access to COVID-19 vaccines with political support for the governor, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.

A rare direct &#x27;live fire&#x27; encounter took place Monday in the Strait of Hormuz between Iranian fast-attack boats and US naval warships. The Iranian vessels came dangerously close to multiple US ships during the incident in the vital waterway off Iran&#x27;s coast.

Faced with potentially devastating recall election, California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) appears to be taking a page from French President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s book - announcing a new plan on Monday to shower residents in stimulus money thanks to a &#x27;massive tax-collection windfall,&#x27; which will help finance a $100 billion state-level economic recovery package - the centerpiece of which would be $11.9 billion i…</span>
