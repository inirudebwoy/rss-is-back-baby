Just as more states project that they have reached peak levels of vaccine demand, and governors like Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer come up with subtle ways to encourage reluctant adults to acquiesce, multiple states are experimenting with offering carrots, even a monetary reward.







Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on Monday offered a $100 financial incentive to state employees who receive the vaccine.

For a long time, the FBI has stood as the admirable symbol of a police agency of government, implacably going after the bad guys and neutrally enforcing the laws. This is the FBI of the movie “The Untouchables,” in which special agent Eliot Ness leads his devoted crew of armed agents in a heroic battle against the forces of organized crime.

The nuclear power plant known as Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC) is slated for closure Friday, fulfilling Gov. Andrew Cuomo's multi-year plan to shutter the aging facility. IPEC is a 2,000-megawatt nuclear power plant located 24 miles north of New York City and presents numerous safety threats to the people of NYC and the environment.

So Powell finally used the F word: Froth. Being non specific though as one would expect and being super careful as to not overtly link monetary policies to the said froth we can note some faint sense of recognition on the side of central bankers that the liquidity avalanche they have unleashed has resulted in market distortions.

An Icelandic resident uploaded a stunning video on YouTube of a new volcanic eruption early Sunday morning.

His critics often joke that when President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan pledges democratic reforms, one should run away immediately. His latest charm offensive in November, aimed at repairing Turkey's badly-strained ties with the West and Western institutions, has proven that the joke still holds value.

It is comforting that the Fourth turning is part of a natural cycle but also very disturbing that it is a period of crisis. As we know from previous cycles, many people suffer and die during a fourth turning.  However, I think we all know that a crisis is upon us as the corruption, collusion, scheming, propaganda, and self interest reaches its peak.

For nearly a century, gold had been pegged at roughly $20.67/oz. Then in 1934, FDR banned private holdings, confiscated people’s gold, and set the value at $35/oz for use in international trade/settlement. It remained anchored at that price for decades.
