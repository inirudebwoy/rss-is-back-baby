                    <span>India, A Well Known Source Of Gold Demand, Is Turning A Keen Eye Toward Crypto

            
India has long been known for being a strong source of demand for gold - not only for wealth preservation, but also for cosmetic and jewelry purposes.


But now it looks as though something else has caught the country&#x27;s eye: crypto.


This could mean that the mantra that Bitcoin is equivalent to digital gold could actually be catching on, Bloomberg noted this week.


Households in India own more than 25,000 tons of gold and, despite this, investments in crypto across the country grew from about $200 million to a stunning $40 billion over the past year, the report says. 


The demand flies in the face of &quot;outright hostility toward the asset class&quot; from the country&#x27;s Central Bank, the piece…</span>

US Inflation is almost as hot as in Russia, but the Fed is still blowing it off...







Consumer price inflation in Russia is red-hot, having jumped 6.0% in May compared to a year ago, 2 percentage points above the Bank of Russia’s target of 4.0%.


Polls in Russia show that food inflation is a top concern, currently running at 7.4%.


But inflation in the US isn’t lagging far behind: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) jumped 5.0% in May.


Yet the central banks are on opposite tracks in their approach to inflation.


Federal Reserve governors keep jabbering about this red-hot inflation being “te…</span>

It was a rough month for seven-time Superbowl champion Tom Brady, who top-ticked the recent collapse in bitcoin almost to the day with his &quot;laser eyes&quot; profile picture change, something he himself mocked yesterday when he tweeted &quot;Alright the laser eyes didn’t work.

It retrospect, this was a rhetorical question because just one day later we learned that Tom Brady and his wife Gisele Bündchen - best known for demanding to be paid in euros top ticking the common currency ahead of its all time high in 2008 - have taken an equity stake in crypto exchange FTX…</span>

Hours after the New York City&#x27;s Board of Elections released an updated ranked voting tally for the Democratic Primary which showed frontrunner Eric Adams&#x27; lead shrinking considerably, BOE officials acknowledged a &#x27;discrepancy&#x27; in the ballot count.







At issue: on the day of the primary, the BOE reported just under 800,000 votes with 96.6% of scanners reporting. On Tuesday, however, the tally was 941,832 votes - nearly 20% higher, according to PIX11.

The first transgender woman has been crowned Miss Nevada in Las Vegas on Sunday and will compete for the Miss USA title in November, according to AP News. 







Leading up to the Miss Nevada pageant, Kataluna Enriquez, 27, won Miss Silver State USA in Nevada in late March. 


The 27-year-old winner had been competing in transgender pageants since 2016, while she was working as a model. She started competing in cisgender pageants at the beginning of last year.

Once upon a time, Goldman Sachs was known as a powerhouse in the world of commodities, a status it attained following its acquisition of J Aron, the commodities brokerage that was once the home of former Goldman chieftains Lloyd Blankfein, Gary Cohn, Harvey Schwartz and others. But Goldman dumped most of its physical commodities business years ago at the start of what was to become a yearslong bear market in oil and other industrial commodities.


Now, after the bank&#x27;s strategists have repeatedly (and correctly) called the run-up in crude prices, the start of what the bank believes will become the next major commodities supercycle (with crude expected to eclipse $100 a barrel in the not-too-distant future), Bloombe…</span>

Last week, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son made waves when he told shareholders and reporters assembled for SoftBank&#x27;s 41st annual meeting that he envisions himself as a &quot;21st-century Rothschild&quot;, explaining that while Rothschild provided the capital to finance the industrial revolution, he and SoftBank are providing the capital to finance the 21st century&#x27;s AI revolution. For emphasis, Son shared the following slide from one of SoftBank&#x27;s notoriously quirky presentations.







Of course, Son&#x27;s obsession with advancing AI technology via the firm&#x27;s venture capital investment portfolio has been a notoriously mixed bag - though Son&#x27;s returns from a handful of successful bets have helped cushion the f…</span>

With BofA predicting that the US is facing a period of &quot;transitory hyperinflation&quot;, one which could last up to 4 years, as a result of soaring commodity prices in everything from metals to food and beyond, in what increasingly more warn is a stagflationary burst right out of the 1970s playbook...

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


As we wait for the final cases from the Supreme Court this week, Monday was confined to orders of the Court, including the granting and denial of review of cases. One of the cases that was declined was Standing Akimbo, LLC v. United States. That is hardly news on a Court that rejects most petitions for a writ of certiorari. However, this denial was accompanied by an opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas who slammed the current federal policy on marijuana as “a half-in, half-out regime that simultaneously tolerates and forbids local use of marijuana.” 


He is, of course, correct.

Once again, hopes that COVID-19 had finally been defeated in the US, Europe and a handful of other countries are being dashed by hysterical warnings about the &quot;Delta&quot; variant, a COVID mutation so infectious that epidemiologists are now concerned that humanity may never reach herd immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic heirs.


The Delta variant has inspired another wave of fearmongering from &#x27;experts&#x27; like Dr. Anthony Fauci, who recently said it&#x27;s the biggest threat currently facing the global COVID response. The media has lapped up these warnings, inspiring some local health authorities to revive mask-wearing rules like they just did in LA.

Proponents of Critical Race Theory are resorting to semantic gaslighting to defend a dogma that most Americans instinctively abhor.

Some pundits claim that CRT is exclusively a school of thought taught in legal academia. On her MSNBC show, Joy Reid claimed that “law school is really the only place it is taught. NBC has looked into everywhere.” Former Lincoln Project co-founder George Conway tweeted: “I don’t think critical legal studies should be taught in elementary schools, and I am ready to die on that hill[.]”

For a while, it looked as if Lloyd Blankfein, Gary Cohn and other senior Goldman executives who were around when the firm first started doing business with 1MDB, the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund that was plundered by associates of former PM Najib Razak while also being utilized as a political slush fund (the money was supposed to be used on public works projects in poor Malaysia).


Although Blankfein and others were forced to return some of their bonus pay, Gary Cohn - who left the bank to serve as Trump&#x27;s top economic advisor for a brief time before being unceremoniously ousted from the West Wing - appeared to have successfully snubbed the bank&#x27;s claw-back attempts, refusing to turn over $10MM …</span>

The Fed&#x27;s &quot;choice&quot; is as illusory as the &quot;wealth&quot; the Fed has created with its perfection of moral hazard.


The belief that the Federal Reserve possesses god-like powers and wisdom would be comical if it wasn&#x27;t so deeply tragic, for the Fed doesn&#x27;t even have a plan, much less wisdom. All the Fed has is an incoherent jumble of expedient, panic-driven &quot;saves&quot; it cobbled together in the 2008-2009 Global Financial Meltdown that it had made inevitable.


The irony is the only thing that will still be rich when the whole rotten, corrupt, fragile financial system of illusory stability collapses in a heap of runaway instability. The irony is that the Fed&#x27;s leaky gra…</span>

                    <span>WTI Extends Gains After 6th Weekly Crude In A Row

            
Oil prices ended higher as OPEC and allies delayed their Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting to Thursday from Wednesday to allow countries more time for talks offering bullish oil traders some hope that any production increase may be less than expected. While OPEC+ members such as Russia have considered backing an increase in output, Saudi Arabia has exercised caution in the face of growing demand and global spread of the delta variant.



“We’ll see the trading continue to be choppy until Thursday when the actual meeting is held and we get the official decision,” said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management.



But for now, while we all await Thursday&#x27;s OPEC+ decision, API will be the next trigger move.

Even a larger-than-expected supply boost from OPEC+ will not reach inventories in time to alleviate the tight market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Damien Courvalin and Jeff Currie wrote in a report.


“Ultimately, much more OPEC+ supply will be needed to balance the oil market by 2022,” they said.

Authored by Michael Snyder via TheMostImportantNews.com,


What we are witnessing right now is not even close to “normal”.  I know that I have been making a lot of statements like that lately, but it is undeniable that some very strange things are happening.  For example, over the past couple of years I have been consistently warning that global weather patterns were starting to go completely nuts, and at first there were some people that didn’t believe me.  But now nobody can deny that global weather patterns have become really, really weird.







At this moment, the Northwest is being slammed by a “heat dome” that is absolutely unprecedented.  In the past, there ha…</span>

Automotive regulators look like they may finally be posturing up and playing at least a little bit of hard ball with autonomous driving and/or driver-assisted incidents. 


Frequent readers of Zero Hedge know that we have been critical of the job done (or not done, for that matter) by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, who appears to be taking a &quot;see no evil, hear no evil&quot; approach to regulating what has been an incessant, years-long slew of automated driving accidents, including several fatal ones. 


Now, as legacy automakers drift further into the realm of autonomous driving, the NHTSA looks like it is finally ready to set some ground rules. It has &quot;ordered auto…</span>

                    <span>Walmart Rolls Out Budget Insulin As Low-Income Diabetics Struggle To Afford Drug

            
Walmart on Tuesday announced that it will begin selling a far less expensive, private-label version of insulin which could help low-income diabetics afford their medication.







Starting this week, the retailer will begin selling their exclusive insulin, ReliOn NovoLog, according to CNBC, with availability at its membership-based Sam&#x27;s Club in mid-July. The cost will be $73 per vial, or around $86 for a package of prefilled insulin pens. Branded competitors are selling the same formulation for as much as $101 per vial / $251 per pack of insulin pens.

Even though the US personal savings rate has dropped substantially in recent months from its post-covid record high of 34%...







... when the US government unleashed the fiscal and monetary bazooka, it is certainly the case that there has been a very large surge in savings in the past 15 months, and as Bank of America economists write today, one of the biggest unknowns in the next few years is what happens to all the liquid savings that households have accumulated. The bank offers a new perspective on this question:



The best measure of excess savings is the massive liquidity building up in bank accounts.

Two Israeli traders facing insider trading charges were once &quot;close associates&quot; of short seller Muddy Waters, before splitting due to a dispute in 2014, according to a new report by Bloomberg. The traders split from Block in 2014 after Block said he suspected that they were selling information from Muddy Waters reports prior to the firm publishing them. 


Tomer Feingold and Dov Malnik were both said to have approached Muddy Waters founder Carson Block in 2010 after Block&#x27;s firm published a report on Orient Paper Inc. 


Block said that even though Feingold and Malnik were &quot;close friends&quot;, they told him that they only had &quot;passing familiarity&quot; with each other at the time. Block told Bloomber…</span>

Haunted by the recent tragedy in Surfside, some residents of ocean-side apartments in South Florida have been searching for information about the structural integrity of their condominiums. The residents of a Collins Avenue building with prior warnings in Miami Beach said they are horrified about what they found.

The fear started after Champlain Towers South, at 8777 Collins Ave., turned into the epicenter of heartbreak and grief on Thursday morning. Some of the residents of the Champlain Towers North and East decided to evacuate.


Days following the incident, two studies on the 12-story residential structure came to light. One was a field study from 2018 by an engineering firm that discovered structural i…</span>

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki drew ire Monday by suggesting that the defund the police movement is being driven by Republicans, rather than extremist Democrats.







In another exchange with Fox News reporter Peter Doocy, Psaki argued that the lack of support on the right for Biden’s massive pork filled COVID relief bill equates to wanting to defund law enforcement.



Absolutely shameless. Under questioning from Fox&#x27;s Peter Doocy, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki argues it&#x27;s *Republicans* who have been defunding the police and not supporting law enforcement because they didn&#x27;t vote for Biden&#x27;s stimulus boondoggle the America…</span>

With most foreign spectators barred, the Tokyo Games are already likely to lack much of the spectacle that makes the Olympics such a larger-than-life event. But as Japan&#x27;s vaccine rollout plods on, the Japanese government is reportedly weighing the possibility of extending the state of emergency measures already in place in Tokyo and 8 other prefectures, leaving the measures in place during and even after the Games.


Japanese press reports claimed government officials have floated the idea of holding the Olympics without spectators if the emergency measures are extended beyond July 11, the date they are currently set to expire.

Via SchiffGold.com,


The S&amp;P 500 closed last week at an all-time record high. This is quite a reversal from the previous week. In his podcast, Peter Schiff said there has been a shift in expectations. After the June FOMC meeting, investors were jittery that the Fed was going to tighten monetary policy to fight inflation. Now the thinking seems to be that there is no inflation problem. It really is just transitory.







Everything is great because – well – the Fed tells us so!



The big difference between last week and this week was last week everybody was worried that the Fed was going to fight inflation. This week they’re not worried that the Fed is going to fight inflation because they don’t think the…</span>

Amid a growing list of examples of US Olympians using the spotlight for &quot;activism&quot; when it comes to respect or lack thereof shown toward the American flag or anthem, we earlier predicted there&#x27;s very likely more to come as the games soon kick off in Tokyo. This is especially likely now that the White House has weighed in to defend Gwen Berry, who will represent the US in the hammer throw at the summer games.


On Monday Fox News&#x27; Peter Doocy raised the issue with the Biden White House of athletes using moments like the playing of the national anthem to &quot;protest&quot; before a global audience. &quot;This weekend, Gwen Berry who is supposed to represent the United States as an Olympian on…</span>

As a reminder, the WHO&#x27;s new naming scheme has the most pervasive variants named after greek letters. Right now, the Delta variant is causing the most trouble worldwide.

Authored by Fan Yu via The Epoch Times,


Beijing’s broadening ban on cryptocurrency mining has - for now - crippled the industry and sent bitcoin prices collapsing. But as bitcoin miners move to other regions and countries, China’s recent action could usher a period of greater stability for the cryptocurrency. 







More diverse distribution of mining power and higher usage of renewable energy could also be in store.


In late May, China’s State Council issued treatises to crack down on bitcoin trading and mining. The notices came after China’s central bank began implementing its own digital currency.

Now that Covid lockdowns are ending, Americans can get back to what they do best: getting into fist fights on airplanes.


Yes, despite the fact that travel restrictions are ending and citizens can get back to vacationing over the summer, things continue to get ornery in the &quot;friendly skies&quot;.


The incidents have become so common, there has been a discussion about ending everyone&#x27;s favorite travel companion: alcohol on flights.

Saw this article come across, come across my news alert for “Transhumanism”. In it Dr. David Eagleman talks about how not only can we augment human senses with fantastic new abilities (like to “see” heat and electromagnetic patterns), but how we’ll even be able to build machines that think too.


There is a line in his thinking that one can glean from the article: on one side of the line are enhancements and augmentations to the human experience which are startling and amazing and which will transform our societies: even more radical life extension will be in the cards quite soon (for those who can afford it)…</span>

After Hong Kong police arrested more journalists from the now-defunct Apple Daily over the weekend, a sign that Beijing&#x27;s crackdown on democratic freedoms under the guise of the new &quot;national security&quot; law isn&#x27;t letting up, health authorities on Monday announced that they would bar travelers from the UK after reintroducing the UK to HK&#x27;s list of &quot;extremely high-risk&quot; countries.

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


Staff at Wi Spa in Los Angeles dismissed a woman’s complaint that a man was exposing his penis to little girls in the women’s area by insisting that the individual had a right to be there due to his “sexual orientation.”







Yes, really.


A video clip shows the woman approaching reception staff and telling them, “I just wanna be clear with you – it’s OK for a man to go into the women’s section, show his penis around other women, young little girls underage – your spa Wi Spa condones that – is that what you’re saying?”


The staffer says the man is allowed to be there because of his “sexual orientation.”

Shi Zheng-li, the director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is the common thread through which many key research projects and gain-of-function experiments on coronaviruses are connected. 


Her work shows a curious pattern of deception tracing through her publications from 2013 to 2020 in which a key source for the coronavirus most closely related to COVID-19 was concealed.

                    <span>Basel III Regulations Finally Kick In: What This Means For Gold

            
On Monday, the long-anticipated (by gold bulls) banking rules implemented under a sweeping international accord known as Basel III came into effect (for European banks) and - as discussed previously both here and elsewhere - mark a major change for European banks and their dealings with gold, &quot;potentially altering the landscape for precious metal demand and prices&quot; as MW puts it.


In a nutshell, Basel III elevates allocated gold, in tangible form, to be classified as a zero-risk asset under the new rules, but unallocated - or the hated by gold purists - “paper” gold, which banks typically deal with the most often, won’t — meaning banks holding paper gold must also hold extra reserves against it.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said over the weekend that his office still has more than 500 election fraud cases that need to be heard in court.







The attorney general made the announcement after a woman was arrested by the state Election Fraud Unit late last week for multiple counts of election fraud, according to a statement from his office.



“We will prosecute voter fraud every time we find it,” Paxton, a Republican, wrote on Twitter over the weekend in reference to the case. 


“Currently, our office has over 500 cases waiting to be heard in court.”

Earlier this year, former Clinton Treasury Secretary and erstwhile Harvard President Larry Summers was pilloried by his fellow Democrats for daring to suggest that the firehose of COVID-inspired fiscal and monetary stimulus would likely cause runaway inflation. Then, over the weekend, Summers doubled down on that (so far, correct) call, warning that inflationary pressures might be more persistent than the Fed&#x27;s Chairman Jerome Powell (who continues to insist that price pressures will ultimately be &quot;transitory&quot; despite the FOMC&#x27;s decision to move up its expectations for the timing of rate hikes to account for hotter-then-expected inflationary prints) has let on.

Authored by Glenn Greenwald via greenwald.substack.com,


For the second time in the five months since he was inaugurated, President Joe Biden on Sunday ordered a U.S. bombing raid on Syria, and for the first time, he also bombed Iraq. The rationale offered was the same as Biden&#x27;s first air attack in February: the U.S., in the words of Pentagon spokesman John Kirby, “conducted defensive precision airstrikes against facilities used by Iran-backed militia groups in the Iraq-Syria border region.” He added that “the United States acted pursuant to its right of self-defense.”

                    <span>Manhattan DA Says No Charges For Trump: Lawyer

            
President Trump&#x27;s attorney said on Monday that Manhattan DA Cy Vance has indicated that he has no plans to charge the Trump Organization with crimes related to allegations of &quot;hush money&quot; payments or manipulated real estate values, according to Politico.







New York attorney Ronald Fischetti said that during a meeting last week he asked Vance&#x27;s team for any details related to charges up for consideration, to which Vance&#x27;s team replied that while they are considering charges against the Trump Organization and individual employees related to alleged failures to pay taxes on corporate benefits - widely reported to include cars and apartments, the potential charges only involve a small number of executives.


&quot;We asked, ‘Is there anything else?&quot; Fischetti told Politico. &quot;They said, ‘No.’&quot;



When asked if the meeting touched on allegations made by Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen and by adult film star and director Stormy Daniels, Fischetti replied, “Nothing. Not a word on that.”


Fischetti also said that Vance’s team told him they will not bring charges against Trump himself when the first indictment comes down.


“They just said, ‘When this indictment comes down, he won’t be charged. Our investigation is ongoing,’” he said.



According to the Washington Post, Vance&#x27;s team is set to proceed with the charges unless otherwise persuaded not to. Fischetti says he expects them to drop this week or next.


&quot;It’s like the Shakespeare play Much Ado About Nothing,&quot; he said, adding &quot;This is so small that I can’t believe I’m going to have to try a case like this.&quot;

A US military base at Syria&#x27;s occupied Omar oil field in Deir Ezzor province has come under attack by unknown groups following last night&#x27;s Biden-ordered airstrike on militia bases along the Syria-Iraq border. Western sources are reporting it as &quot;revenge&quot; by &quot;Iran-backed militias&quot; for the Sunday night US military action against pro-Iranian encampments along Syria&#x27;s eastern border, which left multiple militia members dead.


Syrian state news agency SANA has confirmed that US forces at the oil field have come under attack by &quot;unknown&quot; militants, further as Kurdistan media source Rudaw News has cited US-backed SDF sources which have also confirmed a mortar attack. The US coalition later indicated no c…</span>

Minutes after news that a judge had dismiss an FTC anti-monopoly lawsuit against Facebook sent the social-media giant&#x27;s market capitalization past the $1 trillion mark, Google has just been hit by some disappointing news on the anti-trust front.


Google shares tumbled heading into the close on reports that the Biden Administration was planning to revive a Trump-era investigation into Google&#x27;s display ad business.







While a judge has granted some relief for Facebook, potentially taking it out of the sights of the FTC, which is now being led by anti-monopoly pioneer Lina Khan, it&#x27;s clear the Biden Administration hasn&#x27;t given up on scrutinizing American Big Tech.

                    <span>Facebook Soars Past $1 Trillion Market Cap After District Judge Dismisses FTC&#x27;s Anti-Trust Case

            
Facebook stock soared to a new record high after a District judge dismissed two antitrust cases filed by the federal government and a coalition of states.


U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington on Monday granted Facebook’s request to dismiss the complaints filed last year by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general led by New York’s Letitia James.


According to Boasberg&#x27;s opinion, the FTC didn&#x27;t offer enough details to show that Facebook has a monopoly for social networking services.


As Bloomberg notes, with the ruling, Facebook has escaped the most significant regulatory threat to its business to emerge out of the wider crackdown on U.S. technology giants. The decision also delivers a blow to the FTC and the states, which claimed Facebook violated antitrust laws by buying photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp in order to cut off emerging competitive threats and protect its monopoly.


Boasberg’s decision to toss the Facebook complaints shows the hurdles U.S. antitrust enforcers face in trying to take on the internet giants. Officials on their own can’t break up companies or impose other remedies, but instead must persuade judges to take action. The process can take years.


Facebook stock surged more than 3% on the news, sending the stock to a new all time high...







... and pushing the company&#x27;s market cap above $1 trillion for the first time ever, where FB joins the other quatro comas FAAMG club members.

Champlain Towers developer Nathan Reiber, who died in 2014, was once accused of paying off local officials to sidestep a construction moratorium in Surfside in 1979 because of problems with the sewer system, according to WaPo. 


Reiber had &quot;contributed&quot; to the campaigns of local officials that granted him preferential treatment when it came to building Champlain Towers South in 1981. 







WaPo noted all the principals involved in the design and construction of the building are deceased. Former construction companies that played a role in the construction of Champlain Towers were unwilling to talk about the building collapse.

Authored by Ivan Pentchoukov via The Epoch Times,


The Oakland City Council approved a budget on June 24 that will redirect $17.4 million from its police department to other programs over the course of two years.







The city council voted 7–2 to adopt the plan that would cut $17 million from the police department and direct the funds instead to a violence prevention program, according to CBSN Bay Area. The council’s website was not yet updated with the vote tally on Sunday morning.


The funding diversion was approved amid a surge in violent crimes in the area, including a mass shooting at Lake Merritt the weekend before the vote.

The latest effort to bolster the COVID-19 natural origin theory comes from Bloomberg, which published a glowing interview of Danielle Anderson - an Australian virologist who worked shoulder-to-shoulder with top scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who she then ran cover for - repeatedly insisting that COVID-19 couldn&#x27;t have possibly escaped from the lab.







In a nutshell, Anderson now admits that COVID-19 could have escaped from the lab, but maintains that the WIV followed appropriate protocols, and she didn&#x27;t see any sick workers (despite leaving in November, weeks before the reported illnesses) - a key piece of evidence revealed by the Wall Street Journal.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a warning about the risk of developing heart inflammation to information about the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines.


The FDA announced earlier this month that it would add the warning after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that more cases of heart inflammation—either myocarditis or pericarditis—were found in young adults and children after they received the vaccines, which use mRNA technology.


On June 25, the agency said that it would add revisions to its patient and provider fact sheets about the “increased risks of myocarditis…</span>

The Biden administration has confirmed the president ordered Sunday night airstrikes on multiple militant encampments along the Iraq-Syria border in order to &quot;protect US personnel&quot; - as an official Department of Defense statement in the aftermath indicated.


&quot;At President Biden&#x27;s direction, U.S. military forces earlier this evening conducted defensive precision airstrikes against facilities used by Iran-backed militia groups in the Iraq-Syria border region,&quot; the late Sunday statement reads. It was reportedly a &quot;response&quot; to ongoing drone attacks conducted by Iran-allied forces in both countries.

At a moment the clock is said to be winding down toward a nuclear deal in Vienna, with both sides expressing increased frustration that things are dragging on too long, Tehran is playing hardball with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 


Once again it&#x27;s over access to the country&#x27;s nuclear sites according to prior arrangements: &quot;The speaker of Iran&#x27;s parliament said on Sunday Tehran will never hand over images from inside of some Iranian nuclear sites to the U.N. nuclear watchdog as a monitoring agreement with the agency had expired, Iranian state media reported,&quot; Reuters writes Sunday.

Authored by Jennifer Braceras via InsideSources.com,


Players on the U.S. women’s national soccer team are paid more than their counterparts on the men’s team. But Megan Rapinoe isn’t letting facts stand in the way of her p.r. campaign to pressure the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) into increasing her salary.


In March, the gold medalist and two-time World Cup Champion complained to Congress and to President Joe Biden that she is a victim of pay discrimination. Later this month, she’ll take her case to the court of public opinion in a new documentary, LFG, that will begin streaming on HBOMax.

The initial report had stated: &quot;The Biden administration is walking back the United States&#x27; historic recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the contested Golan Heights region along Israel&#x27;s northern border, a significant blow to the Jewish state and one of the Trump administration&#x27;s signature foreign policy decisions.&quot; But the State Department&#x27;s Near Eastern Affairs Department tweeted in response as the claim began…</span>

Authored by Chris McCann via Race Capital,


Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is redefining the future of finance. There is a major shift going on in the underlying infrastructure powering financial applications, and it’s changing the way we think about permission and control, transparency and risks.


DeFi is a developing market sector within the intersection of blockchain technologies, digital assets, and financial services. According to DeFi Pulse, the value of digital assets locked into DeFi applications grew 10X from less than $1 billion in 2019, to over $10 billion in 2020, and over $80 billion at its peak thus far in 2021. Yet the DeFi applications and underlying infrastructure are still in its nascent stage of development.

If it&#x27;s not one Boeing jet malfunctioning, it&#x27;s another.


With Boeing facing an uphill climb in restoring the public&#x27;s confidence in its crash-prone 737MAX, the aerospace giant is facing fresh troubles, this time involving the updated version of the long-haul 777X jet which is facing additional testing because of what U.S. regulators called a serious test-flight incident and multiple other issues with software and inadequate data.


In a sternly worded letter dated May 13, which was reviewed by The Seattle Times, the FAA warned Boeing it may have to increase the number of test flights planned and that certification realistically is now more than two years out, probably i…</span>

“In 18 incidents, described in 21 reports, observers reported unusual Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) movement patterns or flight characteristics. Some UAP appeared to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernible means of propulsion. In a small number of cases, military aircraft systems processed radio frequency energy associated with UAP sightings.”

For years, we have been discussing the decline of journalism values with the rise of open bias in the media. Now, a newly released report from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford has found something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. The United States ranked dead last in media trust among 49 countries with just 29% saying that they trusted the media.







The most tragic aspect is that it does not matter. The media has embraced the advocacy journalism and anyone questioning that trend risks instant cancellation. 







The result is a type of state media where journalists are bound to the government by ideology rather than …</span>

                    <span>Ford Electric Mustang Breaks Quarter-Mile Record, Challenges Elon Musk To &quot;Race&quot; 

            
So while the Tesla fanboy cult salivates over the Plaid Model S zipping down the quarter-mile stretch at 9.25 seconds at 152.6 mph (data via Motor Trend), the Mustang Cobra Jet 1400, a concept car Ford revealed last year, broke the quarter-mile world record for full-body electric cars this weekend. 







Bob Tasca III, sponsored by Ford, drove the full-body electric Mustang called Cobra Jet 1400, on Saturday and hit a new world record. The vehicle shot down the quarter-mile stretch with all 1,502 horsepower silently screaming, recording a mindboggling 8.12 seconds at 171.97 mph.

The Hawkish Tilt Matters


Some Fed meetings are more consequential than others. We would put last week&#x27;s meeting and Chair Powell&#x27;s subsequent press conference in the eminently consequential category. While the precipitous sell-off in broad risk markets in the aftermath of the meeting has reversed, the uncertainties it unleashed have not. Legitimate questions about the direction of monetary policy and the Fed’s reaction function are now front and center in the minds of market participants. After all, memories of the 2013 taper tantrum are still fresh, and its scars run deep. Considering the role of the Fed’s ultra-accommodative…</span>

                    <span>Biden Team Walks Back Threat To Sink Infrastructure Deal Unless $1.8T Families Plan Also Passed

            
The Biden administration issued a hasty walkback of the president&#x27;s threat to veto a bipartisan infrastructure deal if his nearly $2 trillion &quot;American Families Plan&quot; wasn&#x27;t enacted at the same time.


&quot;If this is the only thing that comes to me, I’m not signing it,&quot; Biden said on Thursday, while touting the deal, adding &quot;It&#x27;s in tandem.&quot;


Now, the Biden team is in full damage control mode after casting doubt on the deal - saying in a Saturday statement that he&#x27;ll sign the roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal even if they don&#x27;t bring AFP to his desk.

A temporary improvement in Illinois&#x27; finances just hit a brick wall...







Illinois&#x27; Temporary Improvement


Thanks to Congressional handouts passed in reconciliation with zero Republican votes, Illinois will receive $13.2 billion in federal funding it can spend over the next three fiscal years.


Supposedly the money was for pandemic-related expenses, but money is fungible. Illinois can use that money for anything, including pension bailouts. 


In addition to the free money, Illinois passed tax hikes estimated to bring in $666 million in revenue annually.


Finally, Illinois borrowed billions from the Fed to pay down its backlog on unpa…</span>

                    <span>&#x27;Heat Dome&#x27; To Roast Northeast States 

            
Time for those living in Mid-Atlantic and Northeast states to turn their thermostats down as the second heat wave of the year begins and will last through mid-week. 


Residents from the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area up to Boston will experience temperatures well above 90-degrees today through Wednesday. 


Temperatures will climb 5 to 10 above average, even as much as 14 degrees above normal for specific areas in the final days of June. 







&quot;A bulge northward in the jet stream pattern will allow for a dome of heat to build across the eastern US into the new week from the Appalachian Mountains east to the coast,&quot; AccuWeather Meteorologist Matt Benz said.


Increased warmth will also coincide with increasingly humid conditions that may result in isolated afternoon thunderstorms, especially in the higher terrain of the Appalachians. 







By Sunday afternoon, metros across the I-95 corridor such as Washington D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston will print 90 degrees. 







On Monday, the heat dome is expected to worsen with temperatures printing into the upper 90s to near 100 degrees from Washington DC to Boston. 







A full-blown heat wave will result in higher power prices for Mid-Atlantic and Northeast states. Already, power prices are creeping higher early Sunday morning, and one would expect prices to increase over the coming days during peak hours. 







Simultaneously, an unprecedented heat wave is striking the Northwest where temperatures are 10 to 20 degrees above average - many homes in those states don&#x27;t have air condition. 


Meanwhile, the western half of the US has been experiencing a megadrought producing fallow lands that may spark a grasshopper plague which would decimate crops.

At his first post-presidential rally on Saturday, former President Trump spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of thousands at a rally in Wellington, Ohio.







As Sharyl Attkission reports, Trump supporters donned shirts reading, &quot;Don&#x27;t blame me, I voted for Trump.&quot;


Banned from Facebook and Twitter, Trump&#x27;s loyal fans found a way to watch him online. His rally racked up over two million views on Right Side Broadcasting Network and Rumble alone in just a few hours. That dwarfs the online interest in videos posted by President Biden.

It appears more US athletes are preparing to &quot;protest&quot; the American flag, after last week transgender BMX Freestyle rider Chelsea Wolfe made headlines for expressing a desire to &quot;burn a US flag&quot; on the Olympic podium. 


There&#x27;s been yet another attention-grabbing display, this time at the ongoing US Olympic track and field trials in Eugene, Oregon. Hammer throw medalist Gwen Berry was on the podium when the national anthem came on over stadium loudspeakers - as it had every night throughout the trials. Just after receiving the bronze medal, she turned her back on the flag during the song and made clear she was opting out in protest.

From Eric Peters, CIO of One River Asset Management 


The fed funds rate was 9.75% when I arrived in the pit, Chicago 1989. US GDP that year was 3.7%, unemployment 5.4%, and inflation 4.6%. But the S&amp;L crisis was widening, as they do. So the Fed cut rates 75bps. Back then, the Fed certainly didn’t signal its intentions. In fact, the Fed neither confirmed nor denied what changes it made to interest rates even after it made them. Unimaginable, right? So we had to guess Fed policy changes by observing what happened in money markets. I obviously didn’t understand any of it, after all, I was an economics major.


The S&amp;P 500 loved that 75bp rate cut more than it feared the S&amp;L crisis…</span>

Binance, one of the world&#x27;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, was banned on Sunday from any regulated activities in the UK when Britain&#x27;s financial watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority imposed stringent requirements against Binance, a sprawling digital asset firm with subsidiaries around the world. The exchange has until Wednesday evening to confirm it has complied with the watchdog’s demands, including removing all advertising and financial promotions, according to the FCA’s register.


Binance must also make clear on its website, social media channels and all other communications that it is no longer permitted to operate in the U.K.

By now, it&#x27;s become quite evident that the western half of the U.S. is facing one of the worst megadroughts in decades. We&#x27;ve spoken about fallow land and drying up reservoirs, but the question remains what happens next? 


Well, it&#x27;s not great, and it&#x27;s straight out of the playbook from the 1930s Great Depression when the same parts of the U.S. were transformed into a desert, triggering a grasshopper plague.

Market Rallies To All-Time Highs


Well, that was undoubtedly an exciting bought of volatility. Last week, we reviewed our “signals” and the market sell-off.



“Well, not only did the highs not stick, but the 50-dma failed during Friday’s sell-off. The market closing at its lows suggests we could see some more selling early next week. The “good news,” if you want to call it that, is that the “sell signal” is moving quickly through its cycle. Such suggests that selling pressure may remain limited and may resolve itself by the end of June.”

As it turns out, Michael Burry isn&#x27;t the only institutional portfolio manager who believed GameStop was undervalued when its shares were still languishing in single-digit territory. In a story published this week, Bloomberg revealed that Joel Tillinghast, the longtime manager of Fidelity&#x27;s Low-Priced Stock Fund, bought GME last year. But, like Burry, Tillinghast and Fidelity dumped their GameStop shares long before they topped $100/share.

Authored by Rupert Darwell via RealClearEnergy.com,


This month, climate change celebrates its 33rd birthday. On June 23, 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen testified that the greenhouse effect had been detected. “Global Warming Has Begun,” The New York Times declared the next day. Indeed, it had.


A year older than Alexander the Great when he died, climate change took less than one-third of a century to conquer the West.







Four days earlier, the Toronto G7 had agreed that global climate change required “priority attention.” Before the month was out, the Toronto climate conference declared that humanity was conducting an uncontrolled experiment “whose ultimate consequences could be second only to a global nu…</span>

Ryanair Flight 4978 was subject to a bomb threat in Belarussian airspace on May 23 and it was escorted to Minsk by a MIG-29 fighter jet where opposition activist Roman Protasevich was detained, along with his girlfriend. Condemnation of the episode was swift with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen descrbing &quot;the hijacking of the Ryanair plane by the Belarus regime as an attack on democracy&quot; while U.S. President Joe Biden condemned it &quot;in the strongest possible terms&quot;.


As Statista&#x27;s Niall McCarthy notes, the event served as a reminder that some sections of international airspace carry an inherent level of risk for passenger flights.

                    <span>Why Gold?

            
Authored by Adrian Day via InternationalMan.com,


At a time when many investors are calling gold “a relic,” and many younger ones, in particular, are buying Bitcoin instead, it is worth going back to fundamentals and looking at gold’s role as money over thousands of years. I am not here to attack Bitcoin. Rather, I am here to defend gold.







Gold has an advantage that Bitcoin does not have, that Bitcoin inherently cannot have, which is its age. Gold has survived and performed its job for literally thousands of years. We shall have to wait a little longer to say that Bitcoin is as good as gold.

                    <span>US Food Banks Warn Soaring Prices Will Affect Distributions 

            
Soaring food prices aren&#x27;t just impacting financially strapped families and the working poor. They&#x27;re also affecting the mission of US food banks who are spending a lot more on food than ever before. 


&quot;We&#x27;re already spending a lot more on food than we have in years past,&quot; said Greg Trotter, a spokesman for the Greater Chicago Food Depository, a large food bank, who spoke with VOA News. &quot;Our food purchasing budget has doubled this year.&quot;


In the coming weeks and or months, food banks across the country may experience a surge in food demand from millions of folks who are set to have their stimmy checks expire. At least 25 states are ending federal unemployment benefits.

Authored by Robert Bryce via RealClearEnergy.com,


Two inexorable energy trends are underway in California: soaring electricity prices and ever-worsening reliability – and both trends bode ill for the state’s low- and middle-income consumers.







Last week, the state’s grid operator, the California Independent System Operator, issued a “flex alert” that asked the state’s consumers to reduce their power use “to reduce stress on the grid and avoid power outages.” 


CAISO’s warning of impending electricity shortages heralds another blackout-riddled summer at the same time California’s electricity prices are skyrocketing.


In 2020, California’s electricity prices jumped by 7.5%, making…</span>

                    <span>UAW President Rory Gamble Announces His Retirement, Marking Fourth UAW Boss In Three Years

            
UAW President Rory Gamble has announced he is going to be retiring on June 30, one year earlier than expected.


The retirement comes as the union attempts to shake a sullied public image as a result of 11 former officials being convicted of Federal crimes in recent years. 


Gamble was instrumental in helping negotiate deals to resolve criminal investigations into the union. The resultant settlements will give the Federal government &quot;prolonged oversight and broad control&quot; over the union. In other words, the gravy train could officially be over for top union officials. 


He also worked to reorganize the union, &quot;disbanding a 17-state region based in Missouri that employed leader…</span>

Authored by Ivan Pentchoukov via The Epoch Times,


A group of Republican senators on June 25 introduced a resolution urging the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to end the mask mandate for fully vaccinated Americans using public transit and interstate travel.







The CDC has already lifted the mask guidance for fully vaccinated people outdoors and in most other settings. But interstate rail lines, airports, and airplanes still require masks in abeyance to one of the early executive orders issued by President Joe Biden.



“Over 150 million people in the United States are fully vaccinated and mask mandates have been lifted across the country. But the CDC inexplicably sti…</span>

                    <span>Japan Trails The World In Vaccination Race As Olympics Loom

            
As the UEFA Euros are underway across Europe, showcasing the return of spectator sports on the world stage, Japan is preparing to host an even bigger event in less than a month. With COVID cases down and the state of emergency freshly lifted in most of the country, it may look like the timing could hardly be better for the Olympics to come to Tokyo, at least under the given circumstances. However, as Statista&#x27;s Feliz Richter notes, for many people in Japan the thought of hosting thousands of athletes, trainers, and media workers from all over the world in the middle of a pandemic remains daunting, especially under the specter of the more infectious delta variant of the coronavirus.


And while roughly 18,000 workers directly involved in the Tokyo Olympics will be vaccinated ahead of the Games, as the organizers recently announced, the same cannot be said of the Japanese population, which trails other rich countries by a wide margin in terms of vaccination progress.





You will find more infographics at Statista


According to official figures tracked by Our World in Data, less than 20 percent of the Japanese population had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by June 22, compared to 53 percent in the U.S., 48 percent in the EU and 43 percent in China. The contrast is even more startling when looking at fully vaccinated people, where Japan stands at a rate of just 8 in 100 people.


Tokyo 2020 will kick off with the opening ceremony on July 23 and competitions will be held until August 8. The spectator limit has been set at 50 percent of venue capacity up to a maximum of 10,000 people. Masks will be mandatory at all times and other rules to limit infection risk will be implemented. The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5. A decision on spectator limits for the Paralympics will be made on July 16.

Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


Ahead of talks between President Biden and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Friday said Afghanistan is &quot;not a winnable war&quot; in response to hawks calling for the troop drawdown to be reversed.


Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) met with Ghani and other Afghan leaders on Thursday. In a statement on the meeting, McConnell called for a &quot;reversal&quot; of President Biden’s withdrawal.


Via Reuters


When asked about McConnell’s comments, Psaki said, &quot;The President made a decision — which is consistent with his view that this was not a winnable war — to bring the US troops home after 20 years of fighting this war.&quot;

Authored by Jamie Joseph via The Epoch Times,


In an unusual move, Los Angeles Sheriff Alex Villanueva has sent a letter to the Board of Supervisors urging them to declare a local state of emergency to address the spiraling homelessness crisis in the county, citing an increase in crime, lack of sanitation, and struggling businesses.



“We’ve been inundated with calls, with concerns, with images from the news, from people picking up the phone, emailing, sending us letters, about what’s going on in Venice,” Villanueva told reporters during a press conference inside the Justice Hall on June 23. “And that is a microcosm of what’s going on throughout the entire county of Los Angeles.”

It may not be quite hyperinflation - loosely defined as pricing rising at a double-digit clip or higher - but if former Treasury Secretary and erstwhile democrat Larry Summers is right, it will be halfway there in about six months.


One day after Bank of America warned that the coming &quot;hyperinflation&quot; will last at least 2 and as much as 4 years - whether or not one defines that as transitory depends on whether one has a Federal Reserve charge card to fund all purchases in the next 4 years - Larry Summers, who is this close from being excommunicated from the Democrat party, predicted inflation will be running “pretty close” to 5% at the end of this year and that bond yields will rise as a result over the rest of 2021.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Dan Johnson is an associate professor at the School of Health and Applied Human Sciences at University of North Carolina Wilmington with apparently equal interest in politics and polytechnics. He posted a short but clear message on Facebook: “Blow Up Republicans.” 







The detonation of people seems to be in vogue with professors this year.


As will come as little surprise to many on this blog, I do not believe Johnson should face discipline for his violent political ideations.

A new report out of the UK which studied several types of gatherings with large groups of people in close proximity found &#x27;no substantial outbreaks&#x27; of COVID-19 following the events, according to Sky News.


A club night in Liverpool was one of the test events (via Sky News)


The combined events were attended by 58,000 people, resulting in just 28 known cases, according to the Events Research Programme (ERP). Of the 28 cases, 11 were identified as &quot;potentially infectious at an event,&quot; while another 17 were marked as &quot;potentially infected at or around the time of the event.&quot;

“We have worked so hard as a country to fight the pandemic,” Hancock, 42, said in his letter of resignation to Johnson one day after pictures of him kissing and groping his top aide - a friend hired last year - at a time he forced everyone else into mandatory lockdowns were splashed on the front page of…</span>

                    <span>Biden Poised To Lift Trump-Era Sanctions On Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader

            
The Biden White House appears desperate to complete a restored JCPOA nuclear deal with Iran in Vienna prior to newly elected President-Elect Ebrahim Raisi entering office in early August, given his hardline credentials which will made any future deal much more difficult to achieve. 


That desperation for a rapid conclusion to Vienna is evident in a new NBC report Saturday. The network cites multiple officials who say the Biden administration is &quot;considering lifting sanctions on Iran&#x27;s supreme leader as part of negotiations aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal.&quot;

Authored by Bryce Coward via Knowledge Leaders Capital blog,


Last week the 10-year to 2-year US Treasury yield curve spread narrowed from 133bps to 119bps in just three trading days. That 14bps curve flattening was a 2 standard deviation event going back to 1990, so it’s safe to say moves like we saw last week are rare. In conjunction with the curve flattening, the cyclical/reflation trade was reversed in its tracks with banks and commodity related businesses selling off while long duration growth stocks caught a bid. Some, but not all of that has been reversed this week. The question is whether we are due for more of the same in the coming days/weeks/months or whether this was an adoration with…</span>

US intelligence has released a much anticipated wide-ranging report on military and government agencies&#x27; encounters with UFOs, or what the report calls unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). The now declassified Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) report which has been sent to Congress was made public late in the day Friday, and reveals the US government has encountered over 140 instances of UAP.


As The Hill notes of the report, out of 144 encounters listed since 2004, &quot;just one was identified with high confidence while the others remain a mystery&quot; — with varied explanations accounting for the bulk of the sightings including possible natural atmospheric phenomena, &quot;airborn…</span>

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


John McAfee’s widow says that her husband was not suicidal when she last spoke to him and told her he would call her later that evening.







McAfee was found dead on Wednesday hours after a Spanish court ruled that he would be extradited to the U.S., where he faced the rest of his life in jail for tax evasion.


Speaking outside the Spanish prison where the anti-virus software tycoon was found dead, Janice McAfee, said: “His last words to me were, ‘I love you and I will call you in the evening&#x27;.”


“Those words are not words of somebody who is suicidal,” she added.

In the wake of the collapse of Champlain Towers South condominium complex in Surfside, Florida, officials Saturday morning are weighing the option to evacuate its sister building, Champlain Towers North. 


The Champlain North tower is located about a block away from South Tower, which collapsed early Thursday morning. 







Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis told reporters Saturday morning that he has spoken with Surfside Mayor Charles Burkettabout about evacuating Champlain Towers South. He states the sister building &quot;was built at the same time and with the same designer.&quot; 


DeSantis said there are no indications that the sister building is experiencing structural issue…</span>

Tesla plans to recall approximately 300,000 China-made and imported Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to address risks associated with its assisted driving software after an investigation by the country&#x27;s market regulator. 



&quot;Vehicles within the scope of this recall may cause the driver to incorrectly activate the active cruise function in the following situations due to the active cruise control system problem: When the vehicle is in D gear, the driver again pulls the right control lever to try to switch gears; When making a sharp turn, the driver accidentally touches and turns the right control lever and waits.

Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times,


Microsoft said on Friday that the hackers behind the notorious SolarWinds cyberattack have launched a fresh campaign mostly focusing on U.S. interests that, while mostly unsuccessful, managed to compromise three entities.







The Russia-based hacking group, which goes by various names including Nobelium, launched the new campaign using “password spray and brute-force attacks,” the Microsoft Security Response Center said in an alert, noting that 36 countries in total had been targeted.


The bulk of the attacks—45 percent—targeted entities within the United States, followed by 10 percent in the UK, and smaller numbers in Germany and Canada. The activ…</span>

Structural engineering firm Morabito Consultants (MC) completed a field survey report three years ago of the now collapsed Champlain Towers South condominium complex in Surfside, Florida, and found structural damage. 


The nine-page report from October 2018 was first noted by The New York Times on early Saturday. The report provides ample evidence of structural damage to concrete slabs under the pool deck and cracking and crumbling in the parking garage. 


Page seven of the report reveals the parking garage of the 12-story building had signs of major structural issues. 



The condition of the Parking Garage levels was reviewed specifically noting any cracked or spalled concrete member…</span>

                    <span>Do You Hear The Bells Ringing?

            
Authored by MN Gordon via EconomicPrism.com,


There’s an old Wall Street adage, you’ve likely heard it, “No one rings a bell at the top (or bottom) of the market.”


The bell, of course, is the signal to sell at the market top.  Here we pause to take exception with this adage. 







As far as we can tell, bells do ring at market tops.  Yet few hear them.  Most people’s ears are plugged with the prospects of easy riches.


Bull markets often give way to manias…where an asset’s intrinsic value becomes less important than the hope that an overpriced asset can be later offloaded at a higher price to a greater fool.  Certainly, irrational pricing based on greater fool dynamics is the sound of a ringing bell.  Though this can go on for …</span>

Authored by Tom Luongo via Gold, Goats, &#x27;n Guns blog,


There was a lot of drama over China’s announcement over the weekend forcing Bitcoin miners to pack up and leave the country. It sparked a furious sell off earlier in the week which briefly breached recent lows just above $30,000 per coin.


But the big question for me, as always, is why now?


There are never any coincidences in geopolitics. Things happen when they happen for reasons. And sometimes those reasons are not readily apparent.


In the case of bitcoin it happened after the FOMC shocked markets the same day Presidents Biden and Putin met in Geneva, signaling a shift in monetary policy which drained markets of a lot of dollars.

If after the first year of pandemic lockdowns and examples of social distancing extremes across the globe didn&#x27;t provide enough levels of COVID-induced crazy and bizarre incidents, here&#x27;s a new one out of India which appears truly unprecedented: a bank customer was reportedly shot by a security guard for not wearing a face mask in accord with the bank&#x27;s rules and a nationwide mandate.


The disturbing incident happened Friday according to the widespread emerging reports in Indian media, which details that a &quot;security guard fired at a customer for not wearing a mask and entering a bank during the lunch hour.&quot; One news anchor for the popular English-language Times Now broadcast reacted by calling it &quot;absolutel…</span>

Authored by Alasdair Macleod via GoldMoney.com,


“The Fed finds itself between a rock and a hard place: either it keeps inflating or the whole confidence-based valuation of financial assets collapses. Either it raises interest rates or the dollar collapses.”


There has been occasional speculation about what happens to asset values in a hyperinflationary collapse. The basis of the question has recently become suddenly relevant, because consumption in America and Britain has been stimulated with unprecedented monetary inflation aimed at consumers, and been met with limited supply, leading to strongly rising prices across the board.

                    <span>Senators Tell Biden Hong Kong Newspaper&#x27;s Forced Closure Requires Mandatory Sanctions

            
Following Wednesday&#x27;s unprecedented crackdown against Hong Kong media, specifically the forced permanent closure of Hong Kong&#x27;s 26-year long running Apple Daily newspaper under the far-reaching China-backed &#x27;national security law&#x27;, two leading US senators are urging the White House to unleash more sanctions in response to the crackdown.


In a letter to President Biden on Thursday Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa), ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, (D-Md), a committee member, wrote that the recently passed Hong Kong Autonomy Act requires the US secretary of state to identify and take action against any foreign person or foreign businesses &quot;materially contrib…</span>

Authored by Drew Van Voorhis via The Epoch Times,


The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is being sued by parents concerned about mask mandates and obligatory COVID-19 testing for the coming school year.







The lawsuit, filed June 22 by Southern California law firm Tyler and Bursch LLP and Children’s Health Defense California, seeks to prohibit the LAUSD and county officials from imposing COVID-19 related mandates on healthy children wishing to return to in-person instruction.


The lawsuit is the first of its kind filed in California federal court related to students being targeted with “illegal and unnecessary COVID mandates,” the law firm said.

Authored by James Rickards via DailyReckoning.com,


I try to keep politics out of my economic analyses, and my approach is non-partisan. But sometimes I can’t avoid it because political policies can have significant economic impacts. Today is one of those times.


One of Joe Biden’s first acts as President was to kill construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. This is a pipeline that would bring oil from the tar sands of Alberta, Canada to the Midwest United States. From there it would be moved through other pipelines or refined and distributed to gas stations and industrial users in America.







Biden’s decision was destructive for a long list of reasons.


The immediate impact was to kill about 10,000 high-paying union j…</span>

                    <span>Japanese Lawmaker Scolds Toshiba Investors, Says Activists &quot;Only Think About Selling High&quot;

            
It appears as though Japanese government officials are interested in trying their hand in activist investing.


At least, that&#x27;s the conclusion we drew after one senior member of Japan&#x27;s ruling party spoke out against activist investors in Toshiba, accusing them of looking for short-term profits. The lawmaker, Akira Amari, also called for more regulation to protect investors&#x27; &quot;economic security&quot; in the case of activists, Reuters reported.


It&#x27;s certainly an interesting target for Amari to defend, as Toshiba has been under fire due to numerous accounting scandals dating all the way back to 2015. The company has also faced &quot;massive writedowns&quot; for its U.S. nuclear business and the …</span>

                    <span>&quot;Unprecedented Event&quot; - Pacific Northwest Set To Shatter Heat Records This Weekend 

            
A &quot;historic&quot; heat wave is set to transform the U.S. Pacific Northwest into a furnace this weekend. It has the potential to shatter long-standing temperature records, according to Reuters. 


&quot;This will be setting the stage for the beginning of a potential historic heat wave for the Northwest this weekend,&quot; the National Weather Service (NWS) said. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for much of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and northern parts of California. 







&quot;High temperatures will still be 10 to 20 degrees above average and lead into the weekend when numerous record highs are likely,&quot; NWS said. 







&quot;A number of Portland Airport high-temperature records are in jeopardy this weekend. Not only will PDX likely set the warmest temperature for June 26th &amp; June for that matter, but the all time record temperature of 107°F remains in serious jeopardy,&quot; NWS Portland tweeted. 







NWS Portland added: the &quot;extreme heat wave this weekend is expected to break several daily, monthly and possibly all-time records. This is an unprecedented event...have a plan in place to remain cool!&quot;







According to Axios, &quot;the heat wave will affect a region where many people lack central air conditioning, raising the likelihood for public health impacts. In addition, power demand is likely to spike at a time when hydropower resources are running relatively low due to drier than average conditions.&quot; 


Heat waves such as this one have been impacting much of the western half of the US this year, sparking a megadrought, fallow lands, and soon-to-be grasshopper plague that may decimate crops further.

Authored by Glenn Greenwald via greenwald.substack.com,


For two hundred forty years, American generals have not exactly been defined by adamant public advocacy for left-wing cultural dogma. Yet there appeared to be a great awakening at the Pentagon on Wednesday when Gen. Mark Milley, the highest-ranking military officer in the U.S. as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified at a House hearing. The Chairman vehemently defended the teaching of critical race theory at West Point and, referencing the January 6 Capitol riot, said, “it is important that we train and we understand ... and I want to understand white rage. And I&#x27;m white.&quot;

                    <span>US Now Says Taiwan Sovereignty &quot;An Opportunity&quot; To Counter China

            
Under Biden the US Navy has sent warships through the contested Taiwan Strait six times in only five months, suggesting the White House is perpetuating Trump&#x27;s confrontational China policy, also as high level US delegations - the latest being early this month led by members of the Senate Armed Services Committee who visited Taipei provocatively on a military transport plane - continue to periodically visit Taiwan. 


On Thursday a senior US diplomat in Taiwan revealed crucial context concerning the Democratic administration&#x27;s long-term policy concerning the ROC, saying that the US has shifted to viewing the contested island&#x27;s status as an &quot;opportunity&quot; to countering Beijing.

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


The unraveling of America&#x27;s social order is accelerating, and denial will not save us from the consequences of the plundering of the social contract.







What kind of nation boasts a record-high stock market and an unraveling social order? Answer: a failed nation, a nation that has substituted artifice for realism for far too long, a nation that now depends on illusory phantoms of capital, prosperity and democracy to prop up a crumbling facade of &quot;wealth&quot; that the populace now understands is largely in the hands of a few families and corporations, most of which pay little to support the citizenry they dominate politically and financially.

Biden said he doesn’t know all the details of the sentencing for former police officer Derek Chauvin for killing Minneapolis&#x27;s George Floyd (the 22 1/2-year sentence just came down).

With last week&#x27;s post-Fed tantrum seemingly a distant memory, spoos just hit a new all time high at 4,275 as low realized volatility helped push the VIX near new Covid-era lows...







... if not the lowest level. Indeed, with the VIX at 16.0, and volatility risk premium elevated, Goldman notes that short-dated hedges are not cheap - especially relative to historically low implied volatility for other key markets (1M SPX implied vol is 43rd percentile vs. the last 5 years, vs. HYG, EEM, and HSCEI all below 15th percentile). As a result, Goldman also sees &quot;heightened potential for realized volatility to approach June’s lows, leaving the VIX with moderate downside.&quot;

Portland Police moved to reassure Antifa extremists that a man they shot in the back was white in order to avoid a riot after it was erroneously reported the victim was black.







Yes, really.


After a man allegedly armed with a screwdriver was shot by cops outside a motel in Northeast Portland, authorities moved quickly to announce that the suspect was not African-American.



There is erroneous information being circulated on social media regarding in the officer involved shooting in the Lloyd district. We can confirm that the subject involved is an adult white male. No one else was injured.

                    <span>&quot;Learn To Code&quot; Pays Off: HFT/Quant Fund Earned Over $1 Billion In Chaotic Quarter

            
Remember when &quot;learn to code&quot; was racist, mysogynist, sexist, and/or homophobic and got some deplatformed from social media for hurting hard-working journalists feelings? No seriously, twitter did...







Well some of those that chose to &quot;learn to code&quot; just got a huge pay-day as Bloomberg reports that Hudson River Trading, a 400-person proprietary trading firm that specializes in equities and stock options, reaped about $1.2 billion from trading in the first quarter.


Founded by alumni of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard with math and computer science backgrounds, the firm describes itself as one that’s “built by coders, led by coders.”

Authored by Pat Buchanan,


On Tuesday, Brooklyn Borough President and former police captain Eric Adams took the lead in the New York mayoral race with 32% of the Democratic primary vote, 10 points more than progressive Maya Wiley, who had the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.


How did Adams beat the elite?


Said The New York Times:



Adams built “an old-school political coalition that united Black and Latino voters,” and was “able to persuade working-class people, largely outside Manhattan, that he was the best candidate to make the city safe from crime.”


Adams’ anti-crime and pro-cop campaign carried four of New York City’s five boroughs, including Ocasio-Cortez’s congressional district in Queens. He lost…</span>

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


Emails obtained by CNN reveal how the Biden campaign pressured Facebook to censor President Donald Trump before the 2020 election.







The messages reveal how Biden campaign officials repeatedly insisted that Facebook remove information that it deemed to be ‘violent rhetoric’, a concern that seemed to be absent during months of leftists rioting and burning down entire city blocks throughout the summer.


After a deluge of public and private complaints by members of Biden’s team and other Democrats, a former Biden campaign staffer said Facebook “essentially did nothing” in response.

... BofA chief equity strategist Savita Subramanian summarized the current state of affairs as follows: &quot;On an absolute basis, [inflation] mentions skyrocketed to near record highs from 2011, pointing to at the very least, “transitory” hyper-inflation ahead.&quot;

Authored by Tyler O&#x27;Neil via PJMedia.com,


On Thursday, the online integrated marketing company Mailchimp suspended The Babylon Bee’s account, claiming that the system detected “harmful information” in the Bee’s emails. After Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon shared the news on Twitter, Mailchimp apologized. It was too late, however.







“I’d email everyone to let them know [Mailchimp] just suspended our account but Mailchimp just suspended our account,” Dillon announced on Twitter. Like many other companies, The Babylon Bee uses Mailchimp to send out emails to its broad email list. Without Mailchimp, the Bee could not tell its subscribers that Mailchimp had suspended the satire site.

                    <span>Russell Bursting With Money-Losing Zombies After Today&#x27;s Rebalance

            
According to Reuters, today&#x27;s annual Russell (1000, 2000 and 3000) rebalance (the final reconstitution is today) is the &quot;biggest trading event of the year.&quot;


While that may be a modest exaggeration (see our preview here), it is certainly the case that small caps are increasingly important to a surging number of retail daytraders. Indeed, as Bloomberg also notes, normally, the annual rebalancing of FTSE Russell’s indexes is a big day for stocks moving in and out of the gauges and a non-event for investors whose asset allocation isn’t tied to the revamp. It’s a somewhat different story this year.

A Fed Lifer’s Five Basis Point Farce


We start with this gem from NY Fed president John Williams. He claims the Fed must keep injecting $120 billion per month of fraudulent credit into Wall Street because, apparently, this quarter’s likely 7% real GDP growth and 5% inflation are not sufficient to meet the Fed’s goals:



“… the data and conditions have not progressed enough for the Federal Open Market Committee to shift its monetary policy stance of strong support for the economic recovery.”…

                    <span>Canadian Housing Market &quot;Gone Berserk&quot; As Investors Stir Bubble Fears  

            
Housing market activity in Canada has become a speculative bubble that is further detached from fundamentals than ever before. Investors are piling into the market, building portfolios of homes as the Central Bank of Canada (BOC) keeps interest rates pinned to the floor since the beginning of the pandemic. 


Brady McDonald, a real investor with more than 100 homes, told Bloomberg that his &quot;net worth has obviously gone up a lot, just based on what&#x27;s happened this year, because the market&#x27;s gone berserk.&quot; 


McDonald began acquiring single-family homes in a small town called Barrie, located in Ontario, in 2015. Now his net worth is &quot;in the millions&quot; as the country&#x27;s real estate market is overheating.…</span>

Authored by Egon von Greyerz via GoldSwitzerland.com,


When will the wax melt that holds up the global economy? Hubris is driving humans and markets ever higher and closer to the sun. The higher everything goes, the greater the risk that the wax melts and the wings that are supporting the global economy just fall off and everything crashes to the ground.


Investing successfully is primarily about managing risk rather than maximising profits. As we reach the end of the biggest bull market in history, investors feel so secure that risk has become an irrelevance.

                    <span>Natgas Futures Hit 29-Month High Amid Heat Wave

            
Natural gas futures climbed higher Thursday on track for a 29-month high as warmer weather and a rise in exports continue to drive demand. 


Front-month gas futures NGc1 rose 9.9 cents, or 2.97%, to $3.432 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) by late afternoon Thursday, its highest level since January 2019. 







The U.S. Energy Information Administration released its report on the state of the natgas inventories and said utilities added 55 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas into storage last week. This is a much lower figure than the 66-bcf build analysts forecasted on Reuters polls. The primary reason for the low storage build among utilities is that power generators burned a tremendous amount of gas to keep Americans air conditioners on as a heat wave and megadrought transformed the western half of the U.S. into a furnace. 


Last week, U.S. liquefied natural gas exports fell 9.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) primarily due to short-term maintenance outages at Gulf Coast ports. However, exports have been soaring in the last couple of months, with averages of 10.8 bcfd in May and a record 11.5 bcfd in April. 


Data provider Refinitiv projected gas demand, including exports would increase from 88.2 bcfd this week to 93.1 bcfd next week


Turning to our note on Jan. 13, titled &quot;Goldman Flips On NatGas, Warns Of Bullish &quot;Perfect Storm,&quot;&quot; it seems as Goldman Sachs&#x27; Samantha Dart was right about &quot;significant upside to NYMEX gas prices this summer&quot; as prices hit 29-month highs.

Banking is at the heart of modern economic systems. The history of banking is also very long. The first banks appeared around 2,500 years ago, according to the latest historical research.


As we have explained previously, banks generate most of the new money in circulation. They have also enabled major economic and societal upheavals, including the Industrial Revolution. Now, banks are central to the approaching change, or ‘battle’, within our economic systems.


In this second blog of our financial history series, we go through the development of banking from that of early money exchangers to the rise of the ‘shadow banking’ sector, and we explain how the mode…</span>

The hunt for survivors has been ongoing for more than 12 hours since the Champlain Towers, a 12-story condo building, collapsed in the early morning hours. 



&quot;This process is slow and methodical,&quot; Ray Jadallah, a Miami-Dade Fire Rescue assistant fire chief, said Thursday afternoon. &quot;Anytime we started…</span>

                    <span>Gun Sanctuary Movement Erupts, 61% of US Counties Now Protect Second Amendment

            
One of the most important stories of the year, so far, is the massive surge in Second Amendment sanctuaries at the state, county, and local levels, entirely ignored by liberal media. 



More than 61% of American Counties are Now Second Amendment Sanctuaries https://t.co/vm5gkNmBqg

— Sanctuary Counties (@SanctuaryCounty) June 21, 2021


According to Noah Davis of sanctuarycounties.com, &quot;1,930 counties that are protected by Second Amendment Sanctuary legislation at either the state or county level... this represents 61.39% of all of the counties in the United States of America.&quot; 







The mainstream media seems to be ignoring the Second Amendment Sanctuary movement because they&#x27;re only focused on Biden&#x27;s administration war on the National Rifle Association and the eventual banning or at least limitations of certain types of weapons. 


As the movement grows and more and more counties become Second Amendment sanctuaries, President Biden&#x27;s war on guns might have hit a roadblock. 


Days ago, we reported all 29 sheriffs in Utah have &quot;pledged to do everything within their power to steadfastly protect the Second Amendment and all other individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution.&quot; 


White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in April that Biden might issue executive orders concerning gun control. 


If Biden moves forward with his gun control dreams, people who are gun owners on both sides of the political aisle will be frustrated with the administration at a time when the country is descending into socio-economic chaos.

Authored by Victor Davis Hanson via AmGreatness.com,


There are lots of reasons why wokeism spread like wildfire once America lost its collective mind during the pandemic, quarantine, self-induced recession, and rioting of 2020. 


Wokeism was never really about racism, sexism, or other -isms. Instead, for some, it illustrated a psychological pathology of projection: fobbing one’s own concrete prejudices onto others in order to alleviate or mask them. 







So should we laugh or cry that Black Lives Matter’s self-described Marxist co-founder turns out to be a corporate grifter?

                    <span>Albert Edwards: The Fed Is Trapped In An Epic Bubble, It Can Never Normalize Rates Again

            
One week ago, we explained why the Fed made a huge policy error last Wednesday when its latest dot plot showed two rate hikes: in simple terms, while market pricing for hikes in 2023 and 2024 went up, yields beyond that dropped as the market said that the best the Fed can do is less than 2-years of rate hikes.







Said otherwise, if the Fed decides to hike - as first Powell hinted and then Bullard doubled down on Friday sending stocks plunging - the market is saying that  it won’t be able to go very far before inflation and growth hit a speed limit, pushing yield expectations after the initial hike lower.

I’ve written for years about different nations’ persistent efforts to dethrone the U.S. dollar as the leading global reserve currency and the main medium of exchange.







At the same time, I’ve said that such processes don’t happen overnight;  instead, they happen slowly and incrementally over decades.


The dollar displaced sterling as the leading reserve currency in the twentieth century, but it took thirty years, from 1914 to 1944, to happen. The decline started with the outbreak of World War I and the UK’s liquidation of assets and money printing to finance the war.


It ended with the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944 that ce…</span>

Lumber futures on Chicago Mercantile Exchange have been nearly halved in a matter of a month to $879 per thousand board feet from the all-time high in May of around $1,711. The reason for the latest downdraft is because sawmills are boosting output and domestic production is increasing, catching up with demand. 







&quot;High prevailing prices have already encouraged lumber mills to boost output, and we anticipate that domestic production will rise even further as labor shortages in the trucking and forestry sector dissipate,&quot; Samuel Burman, assistant commodities economist at Capital Economics.

The only reason Illinois taxpayers are not already majorly screwed over by Green New Deal madness is the unions and the Green party have competing goals.


Wirepoints authors Ted Dabrowski and John Klingner have an alarming report on a Green New Deal bill in Illinois that has stalled only because competing interests have differing views on how to screw taxpayers.

In Los Angeles, people have been hearing about the dangers of drought for decades. But in this land of infinity pools and backyard putting greens — better suited for rattlesnakes and scrub — water never seems to run out.


Yet little Redwood Valley in Mendocino County, which gets a bountiful 38 inches of rain in an average year and sits near the headwaters of the Russian River, has been devastated by this year’s drought. Each resident has been told to use no more than 55 gallons per day — enough to fill a bathtub and flush a toilet six times. 


And in San Jose, where less than half of its usual rain has fallen this year, people have been asked to cut water use …</span>

Instead of going after Archegos and its founder, ex-billionaire &quot;Tiger cub&quot; Bill Hwang, it looks like the investigation is focusing on the prime brokers that extended his fund the margin it used to magnify the size of his bets on a handful of media and tech stocks, including ViacomCBS.


According to Bloomberg, the DoJ&#x27;s antitrust division is handling at least part of the criminal investigation into the collapse. Specifically, it appears they&#x27;re interested in the banks&#x27; discussions about potentially working together to unwind pieces of the Archegos portfolio in an orderly fashion that wouldn&#x27;t spook markets.

                    <span>JP Morgan Warns US Employees It May Require Them To Get Vaccinated

            
Morgan Stanley surprised many on Wall Street - including its employees, clients and rivals - when the FT reported earlier this week that the company planned to require all employees and clients to be fully vaccinated before they can enter any of the firm&#x27;s New York offices.







Despite the controversy that surrounded the decision, it looks like some of Morgan Stanley&#x27;s biggest rivals are weighing whether to impose similarly strict vaccination requirements (now that the federal government is giving employers the &quot;green light&quot; to &quot;incentivize&quot; workers to get the vaccine).


JPM, America&#x27;s largest bank by assets, has ordered workers to fill out a questionnaire on their vaccination status by the end of this month, according to a memo from CEO Jamie Dimon and other members of the operating committee that was sent to staff on Wednesday. Employees who don’t respond to the questionnaire will be nagged by their managers until they do, according to Bloomberg.



“We need you to enter this information so that we can properly prepare for and manage returning to the office,” the executives said in the memo. “In the future, we may mandate that all employees receive a Covid-19 vaccination consistent with legal requirements and medical or religious accommodations.”



Screenshots of the memo were shared by @litquidity, which runs twitter and Instagram accounts devoted to financial memes and industry news.







For now, all JPM employees in the Americas (including those who aren’t vaccinated) should plan to start regular office schedules July 6, though some may have to work remotely part of the time due to occupancy limits.

                    <span>More Container Ships Score &quot;Astronomical&quot; $100,000/Day Rates

            
By Greg Miller of FreightWaves,


Multi-month container-ship charters continue to be signed at jaw-dropping rates above $100,000 per day. The market is getting even tighter, pushing charter rates and durations higher still. Even so, there’s something to be said for shipowners taking a few chips off the table — and some are. To quote American financier Bernard Baruch: “I made my money by selling too soon.”







Shipowner executives participating in the Marine Money Week virtual conference on Wednesday discussed the historic strength of today’s container-ship chartering market and how this unprecedented boom could end.

Hyperinflation may be transitory in the US whose clueless central bank will watch as prices surge by double digits before intervening (if then), but the southern US neighbor, the central bank has seen enough and after pulling a Fed and for month saying that inflation will decline (spoiler alert: it has not) on Thursday Mexico’s central bank became the latest to jump on the tightening bandwagon when it unexpectedly raised rates the first time since 2018 as concern mounts - in the country that can now safely say it neighbors the true banana republic - that persistently elevated inflation may threaten the rebound and crash the economy.

European health authorities have more or less confirmed that adenovirus-vector vaccines produced by AstraZeneca and J&amp;J can, in rare instances, cause potentially deadly cerebral brain clots in patients with low blood-platelet counts. These findings, which were hinted at during the late-stage trials for the AstraZeneca vaccine (which saw its US trials halted for a month over safety issues) have led to some European governments imposing restrictions on the vaccines.







Fortunately for the US, there hasn&#x27;t been any evidence of potentially serious (and rare) side effects - until a few weeks ago, when it was first reported that the CDC was scrambling to hold an emergency meeting to discuss a p…</span>

Real Vision’s Samuel Burke, Jack Farley Ash Bennington discuss U.S President Joe Biden’s announcement that a deal on infrastructure has been reached, and the potential significance that the bond market barely budged on the news. They also analyze how the re-emergence of share buybacks will affect an equity market that continues to make all-time highs. The three also explore whether recent economic data, such as durable goods orders and jobless claims, indicate a rising potential of deflation.

Authored by Tho Bishop via The Mises Institute,


Good news, everyone, the inflation that Americans are witnessing daily is temporary. That is, at least, what our enlightened technocrats at the Federal Reserve are desperately trying to convince the rest of the world of. The latest reassurance that there is nothing to be concerned about comes from Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank president Raphael Bostic, who claimed Wednesday that “much of the data recently has come in stronger than I expected.”







As Reuters reports, Mr. Bostic told reporters:

With prospects before Biden&#x27;s infrastructure deal dimming by the day, and hopes of a budget-busting, multi-trillion package having collapsed long ago amid growing growing splinters within the Democratic party, the president was delighted to announce today that &quot;he had a deal&quot; even if details were seriously lacking.


There&#x27;s a reason for that. According to a snap post-mortem published by Goldman&#x27;s chief political economist Alec Philips, there was some good news, i.e., that the spending it includes &quot;already looked very likely to become law.&quot; The problem is everything else, namely that &quot;the bipartisan deal omits items that we believe every Democrat will …</span>

The Ever Given container ship could soon be released from Egyptian authority&#x27;s control after nearly three months following the vessel&#x27;s accident in the Suez Canal in March that closed the world&#x27;s most important shipping lane for six days. The Suez Canal Authority (S.C.A.) and the vessel&#x27;s owners have been bickering over settlement figures for canal disruptions. However, it appears an &quot;agreement in principle&quot; between the vessel&#x27;s owners and the S.C.A. has finally been reached.







On Wednesday, the container ship&#x27;s insurers released a statement confirming &quot;an agreement in principle between the parties has been reached.&quot; The vessel has been moored in Great Bitter Lake, a large saltwater lake …</span>

As viral videos continue to emerge of pissed off parents putting school boards in their place over Critical Race Theory (CRT) - which charges an entire demographic with a collective crime, uses it as grounds to frame individuals within that demographic as perpetrators of that crime, and then seeks to strip condemned individuals of rights, dignity and equal protection based on that charge (via @AurelianofRome) - Republican lawmakers see an opportunity heading into midterms.

                    <span>The &quot;Great Reset&quot; Is Here, Part 1: The New Blueprint For Worldwide Inflation

            
Authored by James Rickards via DailyReckoning.com,


For years, currency analysts (myself included) have looked for signs of an international monetary “reset” that would diminish the dollar’s role as the leading reserve currency and replace it with a substitute, which would be agreed upon at some Bretton Woods-style monetary conference.







Now, it looks like the move towards the long-expected Great Reset is accelerating.


At the recent G7 summit in the UK, G7 leaders gave their blessings to a $100 billion allocation of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) to help lower-income countries address the COVID-19 crisis.

                    <span>Fully Vaccinated Israelis May Be Forced To Quarantine After Exposure To &quot;Delta&quot; Variant

            
As concerns about the threat posed by the &quot;Delta&quot; variant, a mutant strain of COVID-19 first discovered in India that&#x27;s believed to be much more dangerous than rival strains, intensify, Israeli health officials have just been given the authority to quarantine pretty much anybody who is exposed to &quot;Delta&quot;, even if the individual is already fully vaccinated, Reuters reports.


The heavy-handed decision comes after a warning by new Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Tuesday over new outbreaks caused by &quot;Delta&quot; . Bennett complained that daily infections have been rising again in Israel after weeks of a low plateau credited to the country&#x27;s record mass-vaccination drive.

It has been a week of staggering home prices increase news which has seen the median existing home price surge to a record $350,000...







... up a whopping 24% from a year ago...







... while today we learned that the median new home price surged 18%, also to a record $374,400 (the average selling price was also a record $430,600)...







... the result being a collapse in homebuyer sentiment...







... leading to a sharp slowdown in actual sale transactions, as the soaring prices start to adversely impact the broader market.

                    <span>Apple Daily Closes, Becoming First Casualty Of New Hong Kong Security Law 

            
Arrests continued at Hong Kong&#x27;s Apple Daily on Wednesday as authorities arrested a columnist, prompting the paper to announce that it will cease publication and close immediately, an outcome that many had already taken as a foregone conclusion.


The FT reports that the pro-democracy tabloid, owned by incarcerated media tycoon Jimmy Lai, will close because its assets have  been frozen and many of its staff arrested, making it impossible for the paper to continue publishing. The paper&#x27;s owner, Lai, is facing charges of violating the new Beijing-imposed national security law. He has remained in custody even as the US and UK have protested that they are &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about his condition.

Authored by Ella Kietlinska via The Epoch Times,


Critical Race Theory training, which pressures people not to say certain things, take a certain stance, or forces them into some segregated settings, may infringe on people’s constitutional rights and even violate civil rights laws, said Dr. Carol Swain, a former professor of political science and law at Princeton and Vanderbilt universities.







The main tenet of Critical Race Theory (CRT) is that the people of the world are divided into oppressors and oppressed, and in the United States, “all white people are considered oppressors who benefit from undeserved advantages,” Swain told The Epoch Times in an interview on EpochTV’s “Cr…</span>

China called the U.S. Navy&#x27;s latest sail of a warship through the Taiwan Strait the region&#x27;s most significant security &quot;risk creator.&quot; The narrow waterway that separates Taiwan from China is a highly contested region. 


The U.S. Pacific Fleet said Tuesday the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur &quot;conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit June 22 (local time) through international waters in accordance with international law.&quot;


&quot;The ship&#x27;s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,&quot; the U.S. 7th Fleet Public Affairs added.

Authored by J Peder Zane via RealClearPolitics.com,


The New York Times has decided it is fine to out a confidential source -- provided his name is Tucker Carlson. Its media columnist, Ben Smith, reports that the Fox News star is “the go-to guy for sometimes-unflattering stories about Donald J. Trump and for coverage of the internal politics of Fox News (not to mention stories about Mr. Carlson himself).”







Breaking a cardinal rule of journalistic ethics, Smith identifies Carlson as one of his own “off-the-record” sources. So, too, did “16 other journalists … [who] told me on background that he has been, as three of them put it, ‘a great source.’”

Imagine logging into your Coinbase account one day to find out that you&#x27;re the world&#x27;s first trillionaire. And the best part? You did it all with just $20.


Such was the case for Chris Williamson, a nursing student in Georgia, who woke up one more to find out that the $20 he dumped into the cryptocurrency Rocket Bunny had apparently rocketed in value to over $1 trillion due to a &quot;glitch in the Coinbase app,&quot; according to MSN. 


On Tuesday of this week, he logged into his account to see a balance of $1,189,313,417,915.16.







Williamson said to FOX 5: &quot;I woke up, it&#x27;s like 9am and I always check my phone to check how my crypto to see how it&#x27;s doing and I&#x27;m just like, &#x27;Naw, I&#x27;m sleeping&#x27;. I look at it again…</span>

Gun-control advocate David Chipman is on track to be confirmed as ATF director, even though his government personnel record is hidden from the public. Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are expected to vote Thursday to move Pres. Joe Biden’s nominee to the floor. Opponents to Chipman’s confirmation say the process cannot keep moving forward without getting his personnel files from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

Authored by Birsen Filip via The Mises Institute,


Since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, governments around the world, along with a handful of unelected medical experts, have been behaving as though they are the social engineers of totalitarian regimes (e.g., fascism, Nazism, and communism).


To be more precise, this select group of political leaders and medical experts have upended economies, as well as the lives of billions of ordinary people, by implementing extremely coercive and restrictive lockdowns and physical distancing measures for the stated purpose of bringing the pandemic under control and preventing future outbreaks.

President Trump took a victory lap on Wednesay, after a Politico report that Vice President Kamala Harris is finally heading to the US-Mexico border this week, after months of defensive snarking when asked about the issue.







&quot;After months of ignoring the crisis at the Southern Border, it is great that we got Kamala Harris to finally go and see the tremendous destruction and death that they&#x27;ve created—a direct result of Biden ending my very tough but fair Border policies...&quot; said Trump in a Wednesday statement.

Kamala has come under mounting pressure for failing to visit the border - which President Joe Biden put her in charge of. To that end, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) on Wednesday introduced a GOP bill sponsored by 21 Republicans to censure Biden for a &quot;failure&quot; to faithfully execute US border and immigration laws.


In a Wednesday speech, Boebert said &quot;President Biden passed the buck to Cackling Kamala...It’s not funny.&quot;

Update (1615ET): McAfee&#x27;s lawyer has confirmed to ABC News that his client was found dead in a Spanish jail cell on Wednesday.


The 75-year-old entrepreneur was arrested on tax evasion charges for failing to file tax returns for four years. He has been in jail in Spain since Oct. 6, facing charges that he hid significant assets which included real estate and a yacht. His defense lawyers had argued that the extradition request was politically motivated and therefore wasn’t appropriate. He disagreed with the current monetary system, which has made him “public enemy No. 1,” according to court documents released on Wednesday.

Hannah-Jones is now threatening to sue the school after her tenure application was denied.


Hannah-Jones, a correspondent for the NYT Magazine, had agreed to teach at the university’s Hussman School of Journalism and Media as the Knight Chair in Race and Investigative Journalism. However, after word of her hiring got out, one of the school&#x27;s biggest donors spoke out agai…</span>

                    <span>U.S. Air Force Base Says Drag Queen Show Was &quot;Essential For Morale&quot;

            
Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


A U.S. Air Force base responded to controversy about a drag queen show hosted by the base by saying the performance was “essential to the morale, cohesion, and readiness of the military.”







Yes, really.


Nellis AFB staged its first ever drag queen show on June 17th called ‘Drag-u-Nellis’ – which it said was important in teaching military personnel the “significance of Drag in the LGBT+ Community.”


After some veterans raised concerns about why such an event was being hosted, Nellis hit back with a statement defending the show.



So @NellisAFB is having a base-sanctioned drag Queen show; isn’t that awesome?

Transgender BMX Freestyle rider Chelsea Wolfe said in a now deleted Facebook post that her goal was to &quot;burn a US flag&quot; on the Olympic podium. 


That&#x27;s one way to decrease your chances of making the Olympic team. At least, it used to be...


Wolfe had previously qualified as an alternate for the U.S. Olympic team at the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, according to Newsweek and Fox. 







&quot;My goal is to win the Olympics so I can burn a US flag on the podium. This is what they focus on during a pandemic. Hurting trans children,&quot; Wolfe wrote in March 2020. She was referring to a PinkNews story about &quot;the Trump administration&#x27;s stance on transgender girls in female athletics.&quot;

A leading US expert in influenza viruses has discovered that early sequences of the coronavirus genome from a global database at the request of Chinese researchers.







Professor Jesse Bloom, who works at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, found a project by Wuhan University which sequenced 34 positive COVID-19 cases from January 2020, as well as 16 cases in early February in which researchers looked into diagnosing a SARS-CoV-2 infection using a technique known as nanopore sequencing.


While the results of their researcher were published in March as a pre-print, and in June following peer review, the genomic sequences obtained during the course of their …</span>

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


We recently discussed the Inspector General report on the Lafayette Park protests and the debunking of claims that the federal government and specifically Attorney General Bill Barr cleared the area for the controversial photo op of President Donald Trump in front of St. John’s Church. For a year, legal and media experts have stated as fact that area was cleared for that purpose and that Barr was lying about the federal agencies using tear gas as opposed to pepper balls (even though the legal and practical difference is largely immaterial). Some tried to keep the myth alive by criticism the IG report and its scope.


Now, federal judge Dabney L. Friedrich has…</span>

Update (1408ET): Footage from Wednesday morning&#x27;s incident involving HMS Defender and Russian attack aircraft and a patrol boat was published on the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation&#x27;s Twitter account this afternoon. 







The video, filmed presumably from a Russian fighter jet, captured the moment when Defender allegedly crossed into what Russia calls territorial waters near Crimea.


First, what can be seen is Defender, a British warship with an oddly shaped radar tower, in the distance, with another vessel trailing it. Further, into the video, crosshairs are shown, targeting the destroyer, with several fighter jets buzzing by the vessel.

Iran on Wednesday announced security services prevented a &quot;sabotage attack&quot; on a civilian nuclear site at a moment JCPOA negotiations in Vienna are said to be headed toward an uncertain conclusion.


The alleged sabotage attempt targeted an Iranian Atomic Energy Organization building in Karaj city, which is northwest of Tehran. Iranian officials gave few details, nor did they reveal the precise form the sabotage took, other than to say the incident &quot;left no casualties or damages and was unable to disrupt the Iranian nuclear program,&quot; as the AP reported.

                    <span>The Sources Of Inflation Few Dare Discuss

            
Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via DailyReckoning.com,


Since the word inflation is so loaded, let’s use the more neutral (and more accurate) term, decline in purchasing power: an hour of your labor buys fewer goods and services of lesser quality than it did a decade ago or a generation ago.







While the conventional discussion focuses on monetary inflation, i.e. expansion of money supply, the real rip-your-face-off sources have nothing to do with money supply. The rip-your-face-off sources are scarcities that cannot be filled by substitution or globalization.


Consider skilled hands-on labor as an example. Let’s say some essential parts in essential infrastructure require welding. There is no substitute for skilled we…</span>

                    <span>China-Backed Media Highly Critical Of Texas&#x27; New Permitless Carry Law

            
Nearly a week after Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 1927 that eliminates the requirement for Texas residents to obtain a license to carry a handgun, the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s propaganda news outlet, Xinhua, published a highly critical piece on how the permitless carry law (beginning on Sept.1) could return the Lone Star State to its &quot;Wild West past, or even worse.&quot;  



The U.S. state of Texas may return to its Wild West past, or even worse, predicts an advocate for responsible gun ownership and opponent of the so-called permitless carry law signed by Governor Greg Abbott on Wednesday, which allows Texans to carry handguns without a license or training starting Sept. 1.

Late Stage Globalism Is A Tale of Narratives vs Networks


Over the past few weeks in my weekly #AxisOfEasy newsletter I’ve been covering how Big Tech and the corporate media tried, unsuccessfully, to keep a lid on the Wuhan Lab origin narrative. At one point I half-joked “I’ll shut up about this when it’s safe to talk about Ivermectin”. This week, I did end up writing a piece about Ivermectin, namely how doctors can’t even mention it in their videos or podcast appearances without being penalized by social media platforms.

A new report from the National Association of Realtors said the housing market is &quot;hot in vacation home counties than nonvacation home counties.&quot; 


NAR&#x27;s 2021Vacation Home Counties Report examined more than 1,000 counties across the US using Multiple Listing Service data and found the top % vacation home counties in 2020. These counties are scattered across 16 states and met the criteria for being in the top 1%, including higher price, higher sales growth, and faster days on the market. 


&quot;North Carolina had four vacation counties (Swain, Alleghany, Macon, Watauga); there were three each in New York (Greene, Sullivan, Hamilton), Vermont (Windham, Bennington, Windsor), Massachusetts (Dukes, Barnstable, Nantucket), and M…</span>

                    <span>Trump Organization Sues New York City for Cancelling Golf Course Contract

            
Authored by Ivan Pentchoukov via The Epoch Times,


The Trump Organization filed a lawsuit against New York City on June 21, alleging that its contract to run a Bronx golf course was cancelled for political reasons.







The lawsuit, filed in state court, argues that the contract between the city and the organization did not give New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio grounds to terminate it due to the actions of some of the president’s supporters during the Jan. 6 riot earlier this year.


The lawsuit asks the court to let the Trump organization continue operating the course or pay millions to exit the deal.

                    <span>US Losing 1.2 Million Workers To Early Retirement

            
According to a brand new analysis from Goldman&#x27;s economists, the US is on pace to experience a permanent loss of about 1.2 million workers from early retirement and reduced immigration. That&#x27;s the bad news; the good news - according to Goldman - is that younger workers who have been reluctant to return to the workforce are still likely to do so once temporary disincentives to work disappear (most later this year).  As a result, Goldman is looking for the labor force participation rate to rise by 100bps over the next year-plus to 62.6% (if still 0.8% below the 63.4% pre-pandemic rate).

                    <span>The Higher Education Bubble Has Popped

            
Authored by Rikki Schlott via The Epoch Times,


The higher education bubble has been rapidly inflating, threatening to pop at any moment. Over the past several decades, our culture has tipped the scales from praising and valuing education to downright socially mandating it. As a result, enrollment has skyrocketed to levels never before seen.







While broadening access to higher education is, of course, an ideal to strive for, we’re doing a cultural disservice to young generations by stigmatizing alternative options such as trade school. Increasingly, students feel as though they must get a degree to get a halfway decent job—or even just for the sake of social acceptance.


As a result, more and more students are phoning it…</span>

                    <span>China To Keep COVID Border Restrictions For At Least Another Year

            
As Beijing contends with a COVID outbreak in Guangdong that has spread to an important manufacturing hub while exacerbating issues at a port in Shenzen, WSJ reports that Chinese officials are preparing to keep their pandemic border restrictions in place for at least another year as officials scramble to suppress mutant strains like the &quot;Delta&quot; variant.


A provisional timeline that would see restrictions lifted during the second half of next year was reportedly set during a mid-May meeting of the State Council, Beijing&#x27;s equivalent of the president&#x27;s cabinet. The meeting was also attended by officials from the Foreign Ministry as well as China&#x27;s National Health Commission, among other departments.

Update (1920ET): Having been caught delivering some fact-base &#x27;science&#x27; that does not jibe with the establishment&#x27;s message that all kids should be jabbed immediately, The WHO has rapidly &#x27;adjusted&#x27; its science-based recommendations for whether children should get vaccinated... or not...

The new guidance is as follows: (emphasis ours... in case you are confused by their guidance)

MSNBC&#x27;s top-rated host Rachel Maddow devoted a segment in 2019 to accusing the right-wing cable outlet One America News (OAN) of being a paid propaganda outlet for the Kremlin. Discussing a Daily Beast article which noted that one OAN reporter was a &quot;Russian national” who was simultaneously writing copy for the Russian-owned outlet Sputnik on a freelance contract, Maddow escalated the allegation greatly into a broad claim about OAN&#x27;s real identity and purpose: “in this case,” she announced, “the most obsequiously pro-Trump right wing news outlet in America really literally is paid Russian propaganda.&quot;

                    <span>&quot;I&#x27;ll Inject It Into Your Butt&quot; - Philippines President Duterte Threatens Jail For Vaccine Deniers

            
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has been angered lately for his country&#x27;s low vaccination rate and threatened jail for people who refused to get vaxxed up against COVID-19, according to PNA news agency. 


“If you don’t want to get vaccinated, I’ll have you arrested [and] then I’ll inject a vaccine into your buttocks, &quot;Duterte told the nation on a Monday television address after reports of low turnouts at several vaccination sites in the capital Manila.





He continued: &quot;If you don&#x27;t want to get vaccinated, leave the Philippines... Go to India if you want, or somewhere to America. But for as long as you are here and you are a human being and can carry the virus, you should get vaccinated.&quot;


Duterte demanded the government identify those who refuse to get vaccinated. &quot;I will order their arrest, to be honest,&quot; he said.


Duterte&#x27;s straightforward comments come as low turnout at several vaccination locations across Manila was observed on Monday. 


As of Sunday, the Philippines had 2.1 million people fully vaccinated - with ambitious goals of immunizing 70 million people by the end of the year, in a country of about 110 million. 


Besides jail, Duterte could take a softer approach and follow the route the US government took to increase vaccinations by offering lottery tickets, monetary prizes, trucks, guns, food, and all sorts of other goodies to entice people to get vaccinated. 


However, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra countered Duterte&#x27;s remarks and said in a statement there&#x27;s no law forcing citizens to get vaccinated. 


Later this month, the Philippines is expecting donated shots from the US to arrive.

White Illinois farmers are challenging part of the recent COVID-19 stimulus law in court because it allocates federal benefits based on skin color.







The civil rights suit, Kent v. Vilsack, was filed in federal court June 7 by Sacramento, California-based Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), a national public-interest law firm. Tom Vilsack is being sued in his official capacity as U.S. secretary of agriculture. The firm has filed two other such lawsuits against Vilsack and expects to file more.


One of the plaintiffs, Ryan Kent of Centralia, Illinois, is a white man who grows soybeans, wheat, and corn on a 5,000-acre farm started by his father. The o…</span>

It appears as though California&#x27;s plans to become an environmental and socialist utopia are running face first into reality.


The latest dose of reality came this week when the state, facing triple digit temperatures, began to &quot;fret&quot; about pressure on the state&#x27;s power grid as a result of everybody charging their electric vehicles all at once.


The state&#x27;s power grid operators have been telling residents to &quot;relieve pressure&quot; from the grid by charging their EVs at off-peak hours, Newsweek wrote. 


Twice last week the California Independent System Operator (ISO) told residents to conserve energy voluntarily, including asking to charge their EVs at certain off-…</span>

Did you know that 296 mass shootings have happened in the United States this year?  Needless to say, the vast majority of the mass shootings are taking place in our core urban areas, and at this point many of our largest cities are becoming open war zones.  We desperately need more law enforcement officers on the streets, and as I wrote about yesterday, even some of our most liberal cities are now racing to “re-fund” the police.  Crime rates spiked dramatically all over the nation in 2020, and they are skyrocketing even higher in 2021.

Oil retreated on the day after Brent topped $75/bbl in London for the first time in over two years, as Russia and other OPEC+ nations were said to consider increasing production.



&quot;Just the rumors that OPEC+ will consider adding additional production is enough to pull us back from the $75 mark,&quot; said Gary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy.



On the positive side - for crude - negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal remain on pause after hardline judge Ebrahim Raisi won the country&#x27;s presidential election.


Crude stocks were expected to fall for the 5th week in a row (and gasoline stocks to rise for the 4th straight week).

US equity markets extended yesterday&#x27;s rational exuberance, accelerating higher as Powell faced Congressional hearings and promised &#x27;to the moon&#x27; for everything (actually he pretty much said nothing...which is exactly what the market was hoping for). Interestingly, the moment Powell&#x27;s hearing ended, some selling arrived. Nasdaq outperformed on the day and the Dow lagged...







For context, here is the market&#x27;s performance since the FOMC statement hit last week. The Nasdaq is the leader with Dow and Small Caps underwater and S&amp;P holding modest gains...

The Mayor of Silverton, Colorado snapped at attendees of a trustee meeting recited the Pledge of Allegiance in defiance of his announcement last week that it would no longer be allowed at the start of meetings due to &quot;direct and indirect threats, inappropriate comments in and out of public meetings, and the general divisiveness this is creating in our community.&quot;







&quot;We already discussed this as a board, and any other unilateral decisions we need to know about?&quot; asked Silverton Trustee Molly Barela, to which Fuhrman replied: &quot;If you’d like to find somewhere in the code, something that doesn’t permit me to do this, then I welcome that discussion at our next …</span>

                    <span>Department Of Labor Proposes Change To Tipping Rules

            
By Heather Lalley of Restaurant Business,


The U.S. Department of Labor on Monday announced a proposed change to the tip credit which would limit the amount of non-tip producing work an employee can perform.


Under the proposed rule change, an employer can only claim the tip credit when workers do tasks that are part of their tipped job.







But if a worker is doing tasks that support “tip-producing work for a substantial amount of time,” defined as more than 20% of all hours worked or 30 straight minutes, that employee is no longer doing a job that’s part of a tipped occupation, the DOL said.



“Having considered the dual jobs portion, the Department now believes that the 2020 Tip final rule may fall sho…</span>

Wall Street won&#x27;t rest until it become the biggest - and perhaps only - landlord in the US.


At least that&#x27;s the impression one gets by observing the behavior of the two Wall Street &quot;black&quot; giants, Blackrock and Blackstone. As a reminder, the WSJ sparked widespread outrage recently when it exposed what most industry insiders had known for a long time, namely that Blackrock (and other institutional investors) have been ravenously gobbling up US real estate. Now it&#x27;s Blackstone&#x27;s turn.


On Tuesday, the WSJ reported that Blackstone - which already is not only America&#x27;s largest landlord but also the world&#x27;s largest real estate company with a $325 billion portfolio - has agreed to buy …</span>

In a move that is nothing but symbolic, moderate Democrat Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) has agreed to vote with all his fellow Senate Democrats to move ahead and debate the controversial Democrat-sponsored elections reform bill.







The Hill reports that Manchin said Tuesday that he will vote in favor of advancing a sweeping election bill, after striking a deal with Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) on a compromise proposal.


&quot;We worked it out,&quot; Schumer told reporters.


In exchange for voting &quot;yes&quot; on Tuesday, Schumer said that if Democrats are able to advance to floor debate on the bill -- something they won&#x27;t be able to do because of across-the-board Republic…</span>

But crucially he did endorse ongoing efforts in Vienna for a restored JCPOA nuclear deal, stressing that Washington must immediately ease and drop sanctions in fulfillment of its own original obligations under the deal. &quot;The U.S. is obliged to lift all oppressive sanctions against Iran,&quot; he stressed.

Founding father and the second president of the United States John Adams once said that “Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.” What he meant was that objective, raw numbers don’t lie—and this remains true hundreds of years later.

Fed chair Jerome Powell will speak to the Congressional Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis today and after a rollercoaster ride across all asset-classes in the last few days (post-FOMC), we suspect traders will be hanging in his every word even more than ever.


As the Subcommittee explains, &quot;The hearing will assess the Fed’s emergency lending programs established in the early months of the coronavirus crisis, examine current Fed policies as our economy continues to recover, and consider actions needed to ensure a strong, sustainable, and equitable economic future.&quot;

                    <span>Top Quant Strategy Just Suffered Its Biggest Ever Monthly Loss

            
With all the drama and focus on  the inflation story, especially after last week&#x27;s transitory hawkish pivot by the Fed, SocGen&#x27;s Andrew Lapthorne points out that there have been some even more dramatic moves in factor performance in recent weeks.


Take long/short Value-Momentum, arguably one of, if not the, most popular quant strategies, which had been in the ascendancy this year as both Value and Price Momentum factors converged around the cyclical recovery/inflation theme. But in recent weeks, and especially after last week&#x27;s FOMC, the strategy suffered a historic reversal, posting its worst monthly decline since 2002 according to Lapthorne&#x27;s calculations, with the 4.3% loss on Thursday ranking as the 14th worst day for our Value-Momentum factor since 1990.







And, as the next chart show, on a monthly basis, the monthly drawdown in long/short Value-Momentum has been the biggest on record.







Other quant factors have done better: earnings momentum (bottom-up upgrades and downgrades) remains strong, with 62% of all global estimate changes for 2021 coming through as upgrades and with a high percentage of those upgrades coming through in the reflation sectors (Industrials, Basic Materials, Financial and Energy).


So, while markets have cooled on the reflation theme in recent weeks, the profit momentum story is still aligned, and while the copper price has retracted back to mid-April levels, the oil price is now above pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, Lapthorne concludes, the rate of increase is slowing (it had to at some stage), base effects from last year’s slump will be behind us, and we are entering a period when company reporting is typically quieter. So macro noise looks set to dominate for some time.

Authored by Aden Tate via The Organic Prepper blog,


Yet another consequence of 2020 was the growth of public surveillance (aka Big Brother state) disguised under the umbrella of COVID. When you can convince a populace it is dangerous for them to be unobserved, you create the mindset that public surveillance is for the good of all. 







Big Brother is bigger than ever

As the mutant COVID-19 strain known as &quot;Delta&quot; picks up steam across Europe and the US, one of the WHO&#x27;s leading doctors has just expressed concern about recent research published in the Lancet showing that the first generation of COVID-19 vaccines aren&#x27;t as effective at protecting against &quot;Delta&quot;.


Answering a question from a reporter during the organization&#x27;s regular Monday briefing in Geneva, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said that there is data &quot;showing a reduction in neutralization&quot; for the Delta variant, but not as much as the &quot;Beta&quot; variant - better known as the mutant strain that was first discovered in South Africa.

                    <span>Professors Call For Hate Speech Protections To Be Extended To Animals

            
Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Two professors at the University of Sheffield have published a piece in the Oxford Journal of Legal Studies to extend hate speech protections to animals to deal with hateful “speciesist” remarks. Drs. Josh Milburn and Alasdair Cochrane insist that such protections will help achieve a “more benign human–animal relations within society.”  The need for speech criminalization is based on the view that “some animals do seem to have their social confidence eroded because of their awareness of the risk of violence.”

                    <span>&quot;This Is Not A Temporary Situation&quot;: The Global Chip Shortage Will Continue To Push Prices Higher

            
The ongoing global semiconductor shortage is causing prices of electronics to rise while at the same time pressuring suppliers and material providers to continue raising prices. In the midst of the shortage, demand for consumer electronics has continued to rocket higher. 


Ergo, industry officials believe that the increases are likely to continue, according to a new Wall Street Journal report. The effects can be easily seen in consumer electronics. 


The report notes that items like one ASUS laptop that formerly cost $900 now costs $950. An HP Chromebook laptop that used to cost $220 has seen its price rise to $250. In fact, HP has raised consumer PC prices by 8% and prin…</span>

Authored by GQ Pan via The Epoch Times,


A group of Coca-Cola shareholders are warning that the company’s recent diversity policy would actually require contracted law firms to violate anti-discrimination laws.







In a letter dated June 11, the American Civil Rights Project (ACRP) noted that on Jan. 28, the general counsel of Coca-Cola demanded law firms seeking to keep the company as a client must commit that at least 30 percent of billed time would be from “diverse attorneys,” and at least half of that time would be from black attorneys.


The ACRP, speaking on behalf of “a set of concerned Coca-Cola Company shareholders,” demanded that the soft drink company either “public…</span>

Though it hasn&#x27;t garnered nearly as much attention as the occupation of Lower Manhattan&#x27;s Zuccotti Park, which was widely recognized as the genesis of the &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; movement that exploded in the years after the financial crisis, the occupation of Washington Square Park has shown no signs of slowing down, even with the Big Apple&#x27;s crowded mayoral primary just one day away.


Some have even likened the park to a &quot;no go zone&quot;, a reference to areas (typically outside the US) where high rates of violent crime prompt outsiders to avoid the area.

Authored by Ron Paul via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace &amp; Prosperity,


Last week, the Federal Reserve announced it will maintain an interest rate target of zero to 0.25 percent for the rest of 2021. The Fed said it will also continue its monthly purchase of 120 billion dollars of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.


Some Fed board members are forecasting a rate increase by late 2022 or 2023, though with the rate still not reaching one percent. 


The Fed will neither allow interest rates to rise to market levels nor reduce its purchase of Treasury securities. A significant increase in interest rates would make the government’s borrowing costs unsustainable.

                    <span>Thousands Of Women Report Period Problems Potentially Tied To COVID Jabs

            
The UK&#x27;s vaccine watchdog is &quot;closely monitoring&quot; claims that 4K+ women have suffered period problems after receiving the COVID-19 jab. While side effects like sore arms, lethargy, soreness and muscle aches are included in warnings about potential drawbacks of receiving the vaccine, there are no warnings about period-related complications.


Nowhere are period irregularities listed as a potential side effect of vaccination, so British regulators are trying to determine whether there is actually a link between the complaints and the vaccines.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Below is my column in USA Today on the remarkably united and non-ideological line of cases handed down by the Supreme Court. 







As Democratic leaders demand to pack the Court to create a liberal majority, the Court itself appears to be speaking through these cases. Here is the column:


The Supreme Court has finally handed down two of the five “blockbuster” opinions of this term with rulings on the Affordable Care Act and religious rights. The most striking aspect of the decisions was the absence of ideological divisions. Indeed, the case on religious rights is yet another unanimous decision from a Court that President Joe Biden has declared “out of whack”…</span>

The Hubble Space Telescope remains offline as efforts by NASA to bring its payload computer back online have failed. 


NASA revealed the 31-year old space telescope had its payload computer &quot;halted&quot; on June 13 at 1600 ET. It&#x27;s been more than a week since the low Earth orbit telescope, orbiting at an altitude of 340 miles, has been offline, even though NASA personnel have tried on multiple attempts to restart the computer.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


After he and his wife pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges, Mark McCloskey said late last week that local officials will confiscate the AR-15 that he was holding during a viral incident during Black Lives Matter (BLM) demonstrations last year.







In an interview with Newsmax, McCloskey said that he wanted to keep his AR-15 so that he could either donate it or auction it off because it has “historical value.”


He and his wife, Patricia McCloskey, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges last week. He was fined $750 and his wife $2,000 for holding firearms as BLM protesters walked past their St. Louis home, according to prosecutors. P…</span>

Traders of a certain age may recall that back in 2013, around the time the Fed&#x27;s &quot;Taper Tantrum&quot; sparked a surge in yields and led to a risk asset selloff, a big (if entirely artificial) debate emerged within financial media, where the Fed muppets and their media puppets would argue that &quot;tapering is not tightening&quot; while anyone with half a brain realized knew that this was total BS.


Fast forward to today when Morgan Stanley&#x27;s Michael Wilson opens up an old wound for clueless Fed apologists, saying in his latest Weekly Warm Up note that &quot;Tapering is Tightening&quot;... but then adds that contrary to the market&#x27;s shocked reaction to last week&#x27;s Fed meeting, tighteni…</span>

Over the past couple of years we have become accustomed to expecting the unexpected, but soon we many have to start anticipating the unthinkable.  In this article, I am going to be discussing a couple of potential scenarios that would have been unimaginable to the vast majority of Americans just a few short years ago.  Unfortunately, our world is now changing at a pace that is absolutely breathtaking, and many things that were once “unimaginable” could soon become reality.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) says the state will make landlords whole whose tenants have accumulated past-due rent amid the pandemic - despite the fact that the state has only distributed just $32 million of the $490 million in requests for rental assistance through May 31 in what appears to be typical bureaucratic malarkey.







The state is also weighing whether to extend the eviction moratorium for unpaid rent beyond June 30, a pandemic-related order which was supposed to be temporary, according to the Associated Press. Federal eviction protections are set to expire on the same date, however California&#x27;s protections expanded the number of tenants covered by the moratorium.

The Supreme Court ruled unanimously this morning that the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s (NCAA) regulations that restrict benefits that may be given to student-athletes violate federal antitrust law.







The NCAA had argued that policing student-athlete pay helps to preserve the long-standing amateur status of college athletics. The high court was unmoved, rejecting the NCAA’s argument that it should enjoy antitrust immunity and affirmed a lower court’s order that will allow member schools to offer more education-related benefits to student-athletes.

In its latest Q&amp;A assessment of the state of US fiscal policy, Goldman&#x27;s economics team writes that while it &quot;still looks broadly on track to meet our expectations, risks continue to tilt in the direction of a smaller spending boost and smaller tax hike than the roughly $3 trillion and $1.5 trillion over ten years that we expect.&quot; The bank then notes that &quot;while a bipartisan deal on a broad infrastructure package cannot be ruled out, we continue to think the odds are against it, as there seems to be little agreement on financing it.&quot; Instead, Goldman expects Congress to pass a narrower infrastructure package focused mainly on transportation. If so, expect congressional Democrats to begin moving a broader fiscal pac…</span>

Via AdventuresInCapitalism.com,


Wednesday afternoon, there was a press conference. Some dots were moved about on a piece of paper and JPOW threatened a few basis points of yield in a year or two. I didn’t bother to tune in because I had a hunch that nothing would happen. I was correct. Absolutely nothing happened at the meeting. If not for the price action in some securities I follow, it would be another day of boring summer trading.

Sweden&#x27;s centre-left Prime Minister Stefan Lofven was ousted in a no-confidence vote in parliament on Monday, plunging the country into deep political uncertainty. Lofven, 63, was the first Swedish prime minister to be ousted by a no-confidence motion put forward by the opposition in the European Union member state of about 10 million people.







Lofven, who as Reuters notes was defeated after nearly seven years in power over a plan to ease rent controls for new-build apartments, now has a week to resign and hand the speaker the job of finding a new government, or call a snap election.

                    <span>Amazon Prime Day: That Escalated Quickly

            
After having been forced to move Prime Day to the fall due to the pandemic in 2020, Amazon&#x27;s annual shopping holiday is back to its original summer slot this year. Starting today, Monday, June 21, Prime members will have 48 hours to scour &quot;more than 2 million deals&quot; in order to save some money while spending it.







Originally conceived in 2015 to celebrate Amazon&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Statista&#x27;s Felix Richter notes that Prime Day has quickly evolved into a major shopping event, rivaling Black Friday and Cyber Monday. For Amazon, it has become a great vehicle to boost sales in the slower summer months, explaining why the event has been extended from 24 hours in 2015 and 2016, to 30 hours in 2017, 36 hours in 2018 and finally 48 hours since 2019.


As the following chart, based on estimates from Digital Commerce 360, shows, Prime Day sales have grown significantly over the years. In 2020, total merchandise volume, including first and third-party sales passed the $10 billion milestone for the first time, and there&#x27;s little reason to doubt that 2021 will mark another record in terms of Prime Day sales. After all, the number of Prime members worldwide has grown from 150 million in January 2020 to more than 200 million in April 2021.

Amazon Prime Day deals are only available to members, creating an incentive for consumers to sign up for the program or stay onboard. Research has shown that Prime members outspend non-members by a significant margin, explaining why Amazon is putting so much effort into its membership program.

Via SchiffGold.com,


The markets reacted to last week’s Federal Reserve meeting as if the central bank was about to embark on a major monetary policy tightening spree. But as Peter Schiff discussed in his podcast, the Fed is all talk. It can’t possibly do what the markets think it might do. In effect, the central bank is running a “no stick” monetary policy. The Fed talking but it’s not carrying any kind of stick to back it up.





After the FOMC meeting, Chairman Jerome Powell did his best to set a dovish tone, even though the markets considered the messaging coming out of the central bank to be hawkish. But on Friday, St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard undid Powell’s damage control saying he sees the f…</span>

There is no doubt about it: Taiwan Semiconductor has emerged as the world&#x27;s most important chipmaker.


And now, in the midst of a global semiconductor shortage, it is becoming clear exactly how important the company&#x27;s dominance has been. 


Not only has TSMC made headlines for proposing to expand production into the United States, as we have documented numerous times, but now it is making headlines for how it has become the center of the semiconductor world - and how that can leave the world vulnerable.

Economic Evolution Turns Many Comparisons Obsolete


The financial system has entered uncharted waters and it would be wise to take nothing for granted. To assume the economy will move forward without a glitch in such an environment is  extremely optimistic. With time, things change and evolve, this transformation can be seen in both society and the economy. We are constantly bombarded with charts showing where things are going based on historical references but a question we must ask is just how relevant today&#x27;s comparisons are with prior economic cycles?

If last week the broader market was hammered with one big question mark over the viability of the reflation trade, someone forgot to tell oil with Brent today surging just shy of $75/bbl, the highest level since 2018...







... facilitated by the ongoing failure of the Iran nuclear talks to reach a deal (which is widely expected to boost global oil output), although bullish sentiment was also lifted by a series of sellside analyst calls for oil to rise anywhere from $80 to as high as $100 or more.


The first bullish call came from Citigroup, which said that Brent will touch $85/bbl before Q4 2021, with the bank&#x27;s oil analyst and one-time OPEC advisor, Ed Morse, writing that &quot;we now see B…</span>

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Random selection is not generally an approach that most people opt for in the selection of doctors or even restaurants or a movie. However, it appears to be the new model for some in higher education. Former Barnard College mathematics professor Cathy O’Neil has written a column calling for “random selection” of all college graduates to guarantee racial diversity. It is ever so simple:



“Never mind optional standardized tests. If you show interest, your name goes in a big hat.” 



She is not the only one arguing for blind or random admissions.

                    <span>Petitions To Keep Bezos From Returning To Earth Next Month Signed By Over 45,000 People

            
Over 45,000 people have signed petitions calling to prevent Jeff Bezos from returning to earth next month, when the billionaire founder of Amazon.com is set to ride his phallic &#x27;New Shepard&#x27; rocket into space along with his brother, Mark and an unidentified passenger who paid $28 million to join them.







&quot;Billionaire&#x27;s should not exist...on earth, or in space, but should they decide the latter they should stay there,&quot; reads one petition posted to change.org, which has received over 26,000 signatures as of this writing - many of whom let their feelings be known:







Another change.org petition with over 18,500 signatures reads: &quot;Jeff Bezos is actually Lex Luthor, disguised as the supposed owner of a super successful online retail store. However, he&#x27;s actually an evil overlord hellbent on global domination.&quot;


&quot;Jeff has worked with the Epsteins and the Knights Templar, as well as the Free Masons to gain control over the whole world. He&#x27;s also in bed with the flat earth deniers; it&#x27;s the only way they&#x27;ll allow him to leave the atmosphere,&quot; the petition continues.


Bezos just can&#x27;t seem to catch a break these days.

                    <span>Why Americans Overwhelmingly Reject Critical Race Theory

            
Authored by Mark Glennon via Wirepoints.org,


Stories across Illinois and most of America now report furious parents standing up against what’s bundled under the term “Critical Race Theory,” or CRT, widely taught in K-12 schools.


Those who know what CRT is don’t like it. A new Economist/YouGov poll found opposition beating support by 58% to 38%. And opponents feel strongly. Those with “very unfavorable” views of CRT outnumber those with “very favorable” views” by 53% to 25%. Opposition is even more intense when specific tenets of CRT are polled.







What is CRT? Why the intense opposition? Does only the “right wing” oppose its teachings, as Gov. JB Pritzker claimed on Wednesday?

Last week, amid the fire and brimstone surrounding the market&#x27;s shocked response to the Fed&#x27;s unexpected hawkish pivot, we noted that there were two tangible, if less noted changes: the Fed adjusted the two key &quot;administered&quot; rates, raising both the IOER and RRP rates by 5 basis points (as correctly predicted by Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wrightson, Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo while Citi, Oxford Economics, Jefferies, Credit Suisse, Standard Chartered, BMO were wrong in predicting no rate change), in an effort to push the Effective Fed Funds rate higher and away from its imminent rendezvous with 0%.

Authored by Michael Snyder via The End of The American Dream blog,


Can you imagine what it would be like to not have a home?  For many Americans, this is not something that they need to imagine because it is a daily reality.  Nobody knows for sure how many homeless individuals there are in this country, but recent estimates range from “fewer than 600,000 to more than 1.5 million people”, and everyone agrees that the number has been growing.  Even as the wealthy engage in wild bidding wars over the most desirable properties, more impoverished Americans are being forced into the streets with each passing day.  There has always been homelessness in America, but here in 2021 it is rapidly becoming a crisis of e…</span>

Joe Biden wants reporters to stick to asking him about more simple matters like ice cream flavors. His last Wednesday &quot;What the Hell?!&quot; blow-up in Geneva in response to a pointed series of questions from CNN&#x27;s Kaitlan Collins was but the latest in a recent history of his snapping at the press, which often involves him singling out and going after journalists personally. &quot;What in the hell, what do you do all the time?&quot; he shouted back at Collins while defiantly pointing his finger. He ended by telling the correspondent she&#x27;s in the &quot;wrong business&quot;.

                    <span>Why Net-Zero Is A Suicide Mission For Canada

            
Authored by Fergus Hodgson, op-ed via The Epoch Times,


Canada’s plan for net-zero “greenhouse-gas emissions” by 2050 will come home to roost. Grandstanding has consequences, and in Bill C-12 we are witnessing the legislation to give it teeth. The demonized energy sector appears impotent to resist this attack and is outwardly embracing the idea, presumably to placate regulators and the woke mob.







Grandiose promises, for which the bills come over in decades, are a natural product of election-minded politicians. Their strategy is to garner positive press while leaving someone else to deal with the difficult task of making the promises happen, including paying for them. This is how, for example, unfunded liabilities bec…</span>

                    <span>Cars On US Highways Hit Record Age, May Unleash Repair Boom

            
More and more Americans are driving older cars. A new report found the average age of a vehicle on US highways hit a record high of 12.1 years in January. What this may suggest is a repair and maintenance boom is ahead. 


Bloomberg, citing new data from analytics firm IHS Markit, said the age of cars and light trucks increased by .20 years from 11.9 years in January 2020 to January 2021.

&quot;There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a loser here. New vehicles win. The aftermarket wins,&quot; said Todd Campau, IHS Markit&#x27;s associate director of aftermarket solutions. &quot;The older the vehicles are, the more opportunity there is that they are reaching the end of life, which feeds new vehicle buying.&quot;

The ultimate goal of every totalitarian system is to establish complete control over society and every individual within it in order to achieve ideological uniformity and eliminate any and all deviation from it. This goal can never be achieved, of course, but it is the raison d’être of all totalitarian systems, regardless of what forms they take and ideologies they espouse. You can dress totalitarianism up in Hugo Boss-designed Nazi uniforms, Mao suits, or medical-looking face masks, its core desire remains the same: to remake the world in its paranoid image … to replace reality with its own “reality.”

More and more, it seems like people have had enough with the critical race theory hoax. 


Most recently, parents of students at New York City&#x27;s $57,000 per year Spence School are pushing back after students at the all-girls school were shown a video that mocked &quot;entitled&quot; and &quot;annoying&quot; white women.







The Upper East Side school is now dealing with a letter-writing campaign by parents demanding the school take a &#x27;step backward&#x27; from its woke agenda, according to The Daily Mail. 


Video shown to the students was of Ziwe Fumudoh&#x27;s Showtime show, Ziwe, where at one point the host says to a guest: &quot;I believe that you are not concerned with how …</span>

Authored by Jamie Joseph via The Epoch Times,


As California’s population drops due to a mass exodus of residents escaping high taxes, exorbitant housing costs, and increasing homelessness, there’s another factor that’s been quietly contributing to the downturn: the declining birth rate.







Data shows that while the Golden State’s population continues to grow old, young adults are having fewer kids.


John Moorlach, a former state senator and Orange County supervisor, told The Epoch Times that the long-term impact of the state’s dropping birth rate is “hard to predict,” because the current administration’s border policy has made immigration numbers unclear.

On Saturday a major attack was reportedly launched out of Yemen on two cities in Saud Arabia&#x27;s south, Khamis Mushait and Najran, which utilized explosive-laden drones.


The swarm of drones entering the kingdom&#x27;s airspace reportedly spanned multiple hours, according to regional reports, which cited up to 17 drones intercepted by Saudi anti-air defenses. &quot;The interception operations were successful,&quot; the Saudi military said, noting that many were destroyed prior to entering Saudi airspace while still over Yemen.

Via Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com,


Renowned geopolitical and financial cycle expert Charles Nenner made a huge call at the end of January 2020.  Nenner said, “I am more worried about the market going down 40% than making 5% more on the upside.” 







The market topped a few weeks later (2% higher) and then plunged 38% for the next several weeks. 


Spot on call. 


Nenner also said he was “more worried about domestic civil unrest than war in a foreign land.” 


We had Antifa and BLM rioting, looting and burning in Portland, Minneapolis, Chicago, New York and many other cities for most of 2020.  This was, yet, another spot on call.

In a move that can only be described as the pinnacle of embracing snowflake culture, the CBC has said this week it is going to close comments on all of its news links and video posts to Facebook pages to protect the mental health of its journalists.


Journalists - who used to be rugged and used to deal with varying opinions as part of the job description - are &quot;fragile&quot; and &quot;in need of attention&quot;, like many other Canadians post-pandemic, the CBC wrote last week. Increasingly, they are facing &quot;vitriol and harassment&quot; for doing their jobs, the report notes.

Multiple reports indicate Iran&#x27;s only nuclear power plant has &quot;undergone a temporary emergency shutdown,&quot; according to AP&#x27;s Jon Gambrell, citing local reports via state television. 


Gambrell tweeted, &quot;an official from the state electric energy company said on a talk show that the Bushehr plant shutdown began on Saturday and would last for three to four days.&quot; 


There was no immediate word on why the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, located 10.5 miles southeast of the city of Bushehr, was shut down.







He added, &quot;This is the first time Iran has reported an emergency shutdown of the plant. It went online in 2011 with help from Russia. Tehran previously warned sanctions barred it from getting parts for …</span>

Authored by Ryan McMaken via The Mises Institute,


Policymakers know they hold immense power to regulate and punish firms that don’t play ball. Industry leaders know this too. So it’s likely both sides will indeed end up “playing ball.&quot; 







The Democrats in Congress want comprehensive regulation of social media which will ultimately allow regime regulators to decide what is and what is not “disinformation.” This has become very clear as Congress has held a series of Congressional hearings designed to pressure tech leaders into doing even more to silence critics of the regime and its preferred center-left narratives.

Earlier this month, Wealthion (a new YouTube channel featuring interviews with today&#x27;s top experts in money &amp; the markets) hosted its first online conference, at which economist Dr Lacy Hunt made a strong case in his keynote presentation that deflation -- not inflation -- will win the day going forward.


He predicts that much of the sudden sharp rise we are seeing in input prices will indeed be transitory. And he presented a parade of econometric data that show many historical precedents why this is likely to be the case.


Of course, the current debt, demographic and technological trends are very deflationary. To those who think that the flood of new $trillions in monetary and fiscal…</span>

Authored by Zachary Steiber via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),


Georgia’s secretary of state this week announced he is set to remove some 100,000 names from voter rolls, the first major voting list maintenance following the 2020 election.

The names are being removed because of a National Change of Address form submitted to the U.S. Postal Service, election mail being sent to them bouncing back; or having no contact with elections officials for at least five years.

As expected when it comes to the Iran nuclear deal, newly sworn-in Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has picked up right where Netanyahu left off in warning the world against restoring the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Bennett in Sunday remarks for the first time commented on Iran&#x27;s presidential election. In particular he seized on the Islamic hardliner credentials of the winner of Friday&#x27;s election, Ebrahim Raisi, saying that world powers negotiating in Vienna must &quot;wake up&quot;. 


&quot;Raisi&#x27;s election is, I would say, the last chance for world powers to wake up before returning to the nuclear agreement, and understand who they are doing business with,&quot; Bennett said.

Market Fails At Highs As Fed Spooks Markets


Last week, we reviewed our “buy signals” and the advance over the past month. As we concluded:



“While the market did hit all-time highs this week, it was a feeble rally. Such is not a sign of confidence the ‘highs’ will stick.”



Well, not only did the highs not stick, but the 50-dma failed during Friday’s sell-off. The market closing at its lows suggests we could see some more selling early next week. The “good news,” if you want to call it that, is that the “sell signal” is moving quickly through its cycle. Such suggests that selling pressure may remain limited and may resolve itself by the end of June.

Social justice warrior and &quot;woke&quot; US women&#x27;s soccer team player turned Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel (sigh) Megan Rapinoe - who has spent the better part of the last two years making the rounds on various late night talk shows (and the White House) to talk about how repressed she is and why women&#x27;s soccer players should be paid the same as men&#x27;s soccer players despite two different collective bargaining agreements - looks like she could be the quintessential example of &#x27;when you point one finger, three point back at you&#x27;.

“What the hell?!” – President Joe Biden, June 16, 2021



Out of Control


American workers are trying to make their way in an economy that’s rigged against them.  We made this claim many years ago.  Today, for fun and for free, we revisit this assertion…starting with the latest from those doing the rigging.


This week, after a two day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released their statement.  Nothing material changed.  The Fed will continue to hold the federal funds rate near zero.  The Fed will also continue to create at least $120 billion per month from thin air to buy Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.

A driver slammed into spectators Saturday evening at the start of a Pride parade in South Florida, killing one man and seriously injuring six others (whose conditions are unknown).







Some witnesses said the crash appeared to be an intentional act. Spectator Christina Currie told the South Florida SunSentinel that she was with her family at the start of the parade.



“All of a sudden there was a loud revving of a truck and a crash through a fence,” Currie said.


“It was definitely an intentional act right across the lanes of traffic.”



But Fort Lauderdale Police Detective Ali Adamson told reporters that authorities were investigating all possibilities.

Three city blocks were systematically burned to the ground as hundreds of the local police stood by and viewed the violence. They were obeying orders not to harm the arsonists. The National Guard was called, adding more armed watchers. A passive gendarmerie consorting with open rebellion has rarely been seen in American history, until recently.


Except for variation in detail and numbers, this sort of thing is happening today.



Does the above sound as if it had been written recently?







While it could easily have been written earlier this year, it was not.

Authored by Alexander William Salter via The American Institute for Economic Research,


A specter is haunting the Federal Reserve: the specter of political activism. 







It’s no secret that something strange is happening at the Fed.


Visitors to the New York Fed’s homepage are greeted, not with a description of the Fed’s important monetary and regulatory mandates, but an affirmation of the Fed’s commitment to economic justice.



“We are firm in the belief that economic equality is a critical component for social justice,” the banner reads. 



Social equity is important.


It’s certainly a valid area for policy action. But why it’s any concern of the Fed’s is a mystery.

                    <span>Colorado Home Dubbed &quot;Slice Of Hell&quot; Is Selling For $590k

            
A Colorado listing on Redfin has gone viral with more than half a million views since it was recently listed. The description in the listing calls the house a &quot;slice of hell&quot; after a departing tenant went ape shit during an eviction.


&quot;Now it&#x27;s every landlord&#x27;s nightmare and needs someone with firm resolve to appreciate its potential. If you dream of owning your own little slice of hell and turning it into a piece of heaven, then look no further!&quot; the listing said. 







Photos uploaded to Redfin for the property located at 4525 Churchill Ct, Colorado Springs, show widespread vandalism with spray-painted floors, walls, doors, and cabinets, along with hammer holes in the drywall. 












&quot;There is not one surface of the home that has not been enhanced with black spray paint or a swinging hammer - damage done by an angry departing tenant who didn&#x27;t want to pay rent. But don&#x27;t let that slow you down. It&#x27;s not nearly as daunting as the freezer in the basement that&#x27;s full of meat and hasn&#x27;t had electricity to it for over a year,&quot; the listing continued. 





The listing even warns prospective buyers to &quot;wear your mask&quot; before entering the home. 


At $590,000, the list price is about a 16% discount of what it could sell for if the house was in tip-top shape. 


According to The Denver Post, the price tag to fix the damages ranges between $150,000 to $230,000. This is the perfect fixer-upper for someone trying to buy a suburban house during one of the worst housing shortages. 


Meanwhile, millions of Americans face an eviction crisis in the coming months as pandemic safety nets expire.

                    <span>Buchanan: Who Is Really Killing American Democracy?

            
Authored by Pat Buchanan,


By a vote of 30-1 in the House, with unanimous support in the Senate, Juneteenth, June 19, which commemorates the day in 1865 when news of Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation reached Texas, has been declared a federal holiday


It is to be called Juneteenth Independence Day.







Prediction: This will become yet another source of societal division as many Black folks celebrate their special Independence Day, and the rest of America continues to celebrate July 4 as Independence Day two weeks later.


Why the pessimism? Consider.


Days before Congress acted, the Randolph, New Jersey, board of education voted to change Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day.

                    <span>&#x27;Big Brother&#x27;? San Jose Requires Gun Purchases To Be Videotaped 

            
Less than a month after a gunman opened fire and killed nine co-workers at a Bay Area rail hub, city leaders have implemented Big Brother’-style omniveillance to monitor firearm purchases at gun stores. 


According to Mercury News, the San Jose City Council voted unanimously to approve a new law that requires all gun stores to record firearm purchases on video. What&#x27;s odd is that most gun stores already have surveillance cameras. However, the new law begins in September and will require shopowners to also record audio of all firearm and ammunition sales. 







Mayor Sam Liccardo said the new law makes it more difficult for &quot;straw sales,&quot; in which a person buys a firearm or ammo for someone unable or u…</span>

The trajectory of trans-Pacific spot rates brings to mind the catchphrase &quot;to the moon.| 







Carriers implemented general rate increases (GRIs) on June 1. Spot rates rose. They enacted more GRIs on Tuesday. Rates jumped again. Another wave of GRIs is set for July 1. Add fallout from China port congestion to the mix, and it’s a recipe for rates to keep climbing.


“Despite record highs, rate levels continue to sharply increase,” said Lars Jensen, CEO of consultancy Vespucci Maritime. Past predictions on spot rates have been repeatedly proved wrong — and far too conservative.


Last September, carriers met with Chinese regulators, who reportedly to…</span>

Australia continues reeling from its ongoing trade war with China, lately seeing retaliatory tariffs cause the price of wine to double or triple in China, essentially wiping out Australia&#x27;s biggest export market. 


And now the Aussie government is lodging a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization - specifically over its imposition of anti-dumping duties on Australian wines.


Saturday&#x27;s announcement marks yet another major escalation, with minister for trade, tourism and investment Dan Tehan stating alongside Agriculture Minister David Littleproud: &quot;The government will continue to vigorously defend the interests of Australian wine makers using the established system in the WTO to…</span>

                    <span>Taibbi: Why Has &quot;Ivermectin&quot; Become A Dirty Word?

            
Authored by Matt Taibbi via TK News,


On December 8, 2020, when most of America was consumed with what The Guardian called Donald Trump’s “desperate, mendacious, frenzied and sometimes farcical” attempt to remain president, the Senate’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on the “Medical Response to Covid-19.” One of the witnesses, a pulmonologist named Dr. Pierre Kory, insisted he had great news.



“We have a solution to this crisis,” he said unequivocally.


“There is a drug that is proving to have a miraculous impact.”








Kory was referring to an FDA-approved medicine called ivermectin. A genuine wonder drug in other realms, ivermectin has all but eliminated parasitic diseases like river blindness and elephantiasis, helping discoverer Satoshi Ōmura win the Nobel Prize in 2015. As far as its uses in the pandemic went, however, research was still scant. Could it really be a magic Covid-19 bullet?


Kory had been trying to make such a case, but complained to the Senate that public efforts had been stifled, because “every time we mention ivermectin, we get put in Facebook jail.” A Catch-22 seemed to be ensnaring science. With the world desperate for news about an unprecedented disaster, Silicon Valley had essentially decided to disallow discussion of a potential solution — disallow calls for more research and more study — because not enough research and study had been done. Once, people weren’t allowed to take drugs before they got FDA approval. Now, they can’t talk about them.

As we have been saying for a while now, the Biden Administration&#x27;s push to create a new minimum corporate tax likely will never succeed despite all the optimistic reporting in the western press - a reality that will ultimately limit the degree by which the US corporate tax rate can be raised to finance Biden&#x27;s &#x27;Great Society&#x27; ambitions.


Even after the G-7 struck a tentative deal during its recent meeting, a comprehensive reworking of the OECD&#x27;s international tax framework - what would constitute the biggest shakeup on the international tax front in a century - will require the consent of dozens of nations, including countries like Ireland, Indonesia and Singapore which have s…</span>

                    <span>Another Small Step For Autonomy: Shenzhen Proposes Special License Plates For Self-Driving Vehicles

            
We&#x27;re moving one step closer to autonomy in China...


Southern China city Shenzhen is on the verge of granting special license plates for self driving vehicles, which would mark the first such instance in China, according to Caixin.


It is a step that will help &quot;promote commercialization of self-driving vehicles, such as their use as taxis, instead of being limited to tests,&quot; experts said. It&#x27;s one small step toward widespread adoption, as autonomous vehicles aren&#x27;t currently legal in the province. 


The proposed regulation will be sent for approval by the Standing Committee of Shenzhen People’s Congress at the end of June.







Xiao Jianxiong, founder of Shenzhen-based self-driving company Autox Technologies Inc., says the highlight of the regulation is the issuance of special license plates. 


If the regulation passes, the &quot;Shenzhen government will issue a list of ICVs that can be sold, driven on roads and used for transportation business,&quot; the report says.


There&#x27;s currently no national standards on self driving vehicles in China. Since Shenzhen is a special economic zone, it has more leeway to legislate than most other provinces in China. This would make it an obvious starting point for regulations that may wind up eventually spreading across the country - not unlike how California can often lead nationwide regulation in the U.S.


Xiao says that the number of self driving cabs could reach 50,000 by 2023 in China. So far, in Shenzhen, there are only a &quot;few hundred&quot; self-driving cabs.

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


The National Security Agency (NSA) has agreed to release records on the FBI’s improper spying on thousands of Americans, the secretive agency disclosed in a recent letter.







The agreement may signal a rift between the NSA and the FBI, according to attorney Ty Clevenger.


Clevenger last year filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request on behalf of The Transparency Project, a Texas nonprofit, seeking information on the FBI’s improper searches of intelligence databases for information on 16,000 Americans.


The searches violated rules governing how to use the U.S. government’s foreign intelligence information trove, U.S. District J…</span>

                    <span>US Navy &quot;Shock Trials&quot; Sparked M3.9 Quake Off Florida Coast

            
A reported 3.9 magnitude earthquake off the Florida&#x27;s east coast Friday was actually an &quot;experimental explosion,&quot; the U.S. Navy confirmed.







ActionNewsJax.com reports that a spokesperson with the Navy said that what was measured were a result of military &quot;shock trials&quot; and they are not unusual, nor is it unusual for them to register as earthquakes.







Source


The United States Geological Survey measured the seismic event roughly 100 miles off the coast of Ponce Inlet.





Shock trials test the strength of a ship’s hull to see how it holds up in an undersea explosion (ensuring it can perform in battle).


This is not the first time such &quot;trials&quot; have been undertaken off the Florida. 







In July 2016, a reported 3.7-magnitutde earthquake was actually an &#x27;experimental explosion&#x27; caused by the U.S. Navy, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

With the moratorium on student loan payments set to end with the summer, the American media is once again reckoning with the fact that the US has a hidden crisis with older borrowers weighed down by student debt. In many cases, these borrowers have been paying off student loans for decades.


At the very least, it&#x27;s a depressing image of what might lie in store for millions of millennials, as individual student debt burdens have only grown more unmanageable as the cost of college accelerated beyond all control.

                    <span>California Governor Assaulted By Man During Visit To Oakland

            
Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday was assaulted as he visited a pizza parlor in Oakland.



“This morning, the Governor was approached by an aggressive individual. Members of the Governor’s security detail removed the Governor from the situation and the individual was arrested by CHP officers,” the California Highway Patrol, which helps protect the governor, said in a statement to news outlets.



The man hurled a water bottle at Newsom, who was in the area to tour several small businesses, local media reported.





Photographs showed the suspect, identified as Serge Emanuel Benoit Chaumette Jr., being arrested on Washington Street after the alleged assault.







The man was booked on assault of a public official and resisting an officer charges. He was being held on $35,000 bail.


A woman who identified herself as the suspect’s sister told The Associated Press that he is homeless and has severe mental issues.


She said the alleged crimes he committed were “consistent with his past behavior.”


Newsom appeared unharmed and joked with reporters that “different people have different ways of saying hello,” the East Bay Times reported.







Newsom was in Oakland to visit Beastmode Barbershop and Graffiti Pizza. The visit was meant to promote small businesses as they strive to recover from the harsh rules imposed by the governor during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    <span>Megadrought Could Force California&#x27;s Lake Oroville Hydroelectric Power Plant To Shut Down 

            
One of California&#x27;s most critical hydroelectric plants is at risk of closing for the first time in five decades as water levels continue to sink. 


A megadrought and scorching heat, both worsened by La Nina weather effects, have depleted some of the water supply at Northern California&#x27;s Lake Oroville. The lake&#x27;s current water levels are hoovering around 700 feet above sea level, but if 640 feet is breached, then officials &quot;will likely be forced to close the Edward Hyatt Power Plant for the first time since it opened in 1967,&quot; California Energy Commission spokesperson Lindsay Buckley told CNN.

Back in December 2015, just days before the Fed hiked rates for the first time since the global financial crisis, in its first tightening campaign since June 2004, we said that Yellen was about to engage in a great policy error, one which like the Ghost of 1937, would end in disaster...







... and sure enough it did, when after 9 rate hikes, Powell realized that a rate of 2.50% is unsustainable for the US economy which first cracked during the summer of 2019 repo crisis when the Fed cut rates three times, only to cut rates to zero from 1.75% in a matter of days after covid conveniently emerged on the global scene and led to an overnight shutdown of the US economy and &quot;forc…</span>

If contemporary American liberalism has any High Priests, foremost among them would have to be Jon Stewart. Arguably, he’s the functional equivalent of a supreme pontiff. So much of contemporary American liberalism hinges on aesthetic presentation — the ever-present need to convey that you and your peers “get it” — and Stewart pioneered the perfect public sensibility tailored to this ambition. For years, cultural liberals’ sense of savviness and ironic detachment, coupled with an underlying pretension to earnestness, was cultivated and affirmed by Stewart.

Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


On Friday, the White House denied a Politico report that said the Biden administration temporarily paused a $100 million in additional military assistance for Ukraine. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the idea that the US halted the aid is &quot;nonsense.&quot;


&quot;The idea that we have held back security assistance to Ukraine is nonsense. Just last week — in the run-up to the US-Russia Summit — we provided a $150 million package of security assistance, including lethal assistance. We have now provided the entire amount appropriated by Congress through the Ukraine security assistance initiative,&quot; Psaki said in a statement.

                    <span>Shenzhen Airport Cancels Hundreds Of Flights Amid New COVID Cases

            
The southern coastal province of Guangdong appears to be the epicenter of new coronavirus cases as Shenzhen airport has canceled hundreds of flights and tightened entry controls. 


Shenzhen health officials said a restaurant employee at Shenzhen Baoan International Airport had been infected with the &quot;Delta strain, a variant described as fast-spreading, with a high viral load and a short incubation period,&quot; according to South China Morning Post. 







The woman tested positive during a test for airport staff conducted Thursday, according to health officials. 


China on Friday reported 30 new infections, including six local transmissions in the southern province of Guangdong, where Shenzhen is located.


As we&#x27;ve noted, infections at neighboring Yantian International Container Terminal, a deepwater port in Shenzhen, about an hour east of the airport, has been operating at 40% capacity after a recent surge in infections. This has resulted in significant port congestion. The world&#x27;s largest container line, Maersk, warned last week congestion at Yantian is worse than the shutdown of the Suez Canal in March.


Data from flight tracker VariFlight shows 400 inbound and outbound flights were canceled Friday. More are expected Saturday. 


Chen Bin, deputy director of Guangzhou&#x27;s health commission, said there was still an elevated threat of a community outbreak. He warned against an easing of lockdown measures and said residents in locked-down areas would be tested regularly to prevent a spread. 


So if you were hoping the logistical nightmare in China would be over in the intermediate timeframe, think again. 


More than 60,000 factories are situated in Guangdong, and about a third of China&#x27;s exports and one-third of the world&#x27;s production of shoes, textiles, and toys move through airports and seaports in the region.

Authored by Tuomas Malinen via GnSEconomics.com,


We are approaching a critical turning point in the history of financial systems.


Since the Great Financial Crisis, central banks have exerted control over the financial markets through their QE-programs and plan to extend their influence over the monetary system through the introduction of national digital currencies.  Opposing forces include, as usual, those of financial innovation, which include independent cryptocurrencies.


In the June issue of our Q-Review series, we will delve deep into the world of digital currencies and the future of monetary systems. To accompany our report, we intend to publish a series of blogs which examine the long history of monetary and financial systems.

                    <span>Florida Braces For Another Saharan Dust Storm 

            
Ten days ago, NASA&#x27;s satellite spotted a massive dust storm blowing off the Sahara Desert and into the waters of the Atlantic Basin. At the time, we forecasted dust clouds were &quot;headed for the Americas.&quot; 


Fast forward today, millions of tons of Sahara&#x27;s nutrient-laden minerals have been whisked across the Atlantic Ocean and are set to arrive in South Florida on Friday or Saturday.


Satellite footage shows the airborne dust particles have already blanketed parts of the Caribbean.



#SaharanDust has been on the move across the Atlantic for the past few weeks. So far, no clouds thick enough to make it to Texas before dissipating - and none on the horizon. #TXwx #OrangeHaze pic.twitter.com/JmxrvUo5N6

What to expect in South Florida? 


Well, of course, dust can deteriorate air quality but also create milky, hazy colored skies. 


According to NOAA, &quot;Sunsets and sunrises take on more yellow and reddish hues because the low-angle sunlight passes through more of the atmosphere before it reaches your eyes. A heavy load of dust in the atmosphere can enhance this effect, leading to longer-lasting, duskier colors that cause vivid sunsets and sunrises.&quot;







This latest storm comes one year after the largest dust storm in two decades blanketed the Caribbean and even dimmed skies over US Gulf states. 


Skywatchers are already reporting &quot;some Saharan dust effect here in Florida this morning beautiful sunrise.&quot;

Authored by Ben Weingarten via RealClearInvestigations (emphasis ours),


In a wide-ranging interview from the corner office atop his eponymous New York City tower last week, an unfiltered Donald Trump showed he has lost none of his edge as he attacked President Biden’s ethics, demanded reparations from China for COVID-19, and advanced his claim that the 2020 election was stolen.







Here are some of the highlights, as the former president held forth on a range of issues in his inimitable style.

Iranians are voting nationwide Friday as longtime president Hassan Rouhani - the well-known moderate who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA) - is on his way out after having served his limit of two terms. His time in office will expire on August 3rd. 


There are widespread reports of much lower than expected turnout even after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei pleaded for people to go to the polls as he cast his vote Friday morning in Tehran. &quot;Each vote counts... come and vote and choose your president,&quot; he said. &quot;This is important for the future of your country.&quot;

Optimists are always looking for silver linings in dark clouds. Can any such thing be discerned in our present cultural revolution of politically correct virtue signaling wokeism?







First, let us consider, well, briefly mention, the clouds.




	
California is reducing mathematics studies because this discipline has a disparate impact on subcategories of its student population.

	

	

	
Women are now welcomed in the U.S. military even though they cannot pass the previously established tests of physical ability. Due to disparate results, these exams have been modified; that is, weakened.

A major &quot;realignment&quot; of US defense priorities is resulting in a new extended drawdown of troops, aircraft, and anti-aircraft missiles from the Middle East, The Wall Street journal says in a new report, especially a prior missile battery build-up under Trump in Saudi Arabia.


&quot;The Pentagon is pulling approximately eight Patriot antimissile batteries from countries including Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, according to officials,&quot; the report details. &quot;Another antimissile system known as a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad system, is being withdrawn from Saudi Arabia, and jet fighter squadrons assigned to the region are being reduced, those officials said.&quot;

Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com, 


Despite the constant hype around a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley believes China has a &quot;ways to go&quot; when it comes to developing the capability to take the island.


&quot;My assessment, in terms of capability, I think China has a ways to go to develop the actual, no-kidding capability to conduct military operations to seize through military means the entire island of Taiwan, if they wanted to do that,&quot; Milley told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday.

Now after six rounds of talks in Vienna, hopes for a restored nuclear deal are looking dimmer given the crucial &quot;wild card&quot; issue of Iran&#x27;s ongoing presidential election, also as the Ayatollah warned a full month ago that he wouldn&#x27;t wouldn&#x27;t let the talks &quot;drag on&quot; toward no definite rapid end goal.


Iranians took to the polls Friday in the nationwide vote; however, turnout was widely reported as much lower than expected as seven candidates on Thursday had been whittled down to four - with three out of the four being considered Islamic hardliners. The increasing likelihood of an Ebrahim Raisi victory has Washington very worried.

Authored by Mark Tapscott via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),


An IRS official denied tax-exempt status to a Texas group that encourages church members to pray for state and national leaders regardless of their party affiliation because it benefits “the private interests of the [Republican] Party.”



“You do not qualify as an organization described in IRS Section 501(c)(3). You engage in prohibited political campaign intervention,” wrote Stephen A. Martin, Director of the IRS Office of Exempt Organizations Rulings and Agreements in a May 18 letter (pdf) to Christians Engaged, the Garland, Texas-based prayer group recognized by Texas officials as tax-exempt.

                    <span>Family Of Top Biden Officials Find Jobs Across Administration Despite &#x27;No Nepotism&#x27; Pledge

            
During his tenure in office, President Trump faced incessant criticism from the media for hiring family members - including his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner - and placing friends in positions of authority within his administration.


But just as President Joe Biden has ripped off many aspects of Trump&#x27;s &quot;America First&quot; foreign policy and rhetoric, top officials in his administration have shown little compunction about hiring family members, despite Biden&#x27;s promise that nepotism wouldn&#x27;t be a feature of his administration.

Authored by Glenn Greenwald via greenwald.substack.com,


The axis of liberal media outlets and their allied activist groups — CNN, NBC News, The Washington Post, Media Matters — are in an angry uproar over a recent report questioning the foreknowledge and involvement of the FBI in the January 6 Capitol riot. As soon as that new report was published on Monday, a consensus instantly emerged in these liberal media precincts that this is an unhinged, ignorant and insane conspiracy theory that deserves no consideration.

After announcing last month that Chinese families would now be permitted to have up to three children, Chinese authorities are now planning to scrap all restrictions on birth rates in the coming years, with the new policy expected to be implemented first in China&#x27;s most economically-troubled regions. According to WSJ, which broke the news in the US, senior CCP officials are discussing the possibility of doing away with these restrictions entirely by 2025, when the CCP&#x27;s current five-year economic plan is slated to conclude.

Authored by Donald J. Trump via RealClearPolitics.com (emphasis ours),


As a candidate, Joe Biden’s number one promise was to “unite” America. Yet in his first months as president, his number one priority has been to divide our country by race and gender at every turn.







There is no clearer example than the Biden administration’s new effort aimed at indoctrinating America’s schoolchildren with some of the most toxic and anti-American theories ever conceived.


It is vital for Americans to understand what this initiative would do, what drives it and, most importantly, how we can stop it.

                    <span>American Catholic Bishops Advance Plan To Deny Biden Communion Over Abortion

            
Flouting a warning from the Vatican and Pope Francis, whose liberal leanings have angered many Catholic conservatives, a conclave of American Roman Catholic bishops has voted to advance a new rule that would push priests to deny communion to President Biden and other Democrats over their support for abortion rights.


In a decision made public on Friday afternoon, American bishops voted to draft a statement on the sacrament of the Eucharist, capping three days of contentious debate at a virtual June meeting of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. The vote won with 73% in favor, to 24% opposed.

The only dynamic that&#x27;s even faintly &quot;capitalist&quot; about America&#x27;s Crony-Socialism is the price of political corruption is still a &quot;market.&quot;







The supposed &quot;choice&quot; between &quot;capitalism&quot; and &quot;socialism&quot; is a useful fabrication masking the worst of all possible worlds we inhabit: Capitalism for the powerless and Crony-Socialism for the powerful. Capitalism&#x27;s primary dynamics are reserved solely for the powerless: market price of money, capital&#x27;s exploitive potential, free-for-all competition and creative destruction.

Wednesday - Fed was shockingly hawkish


Thursday - on second thought the Fed was dovish


Friday - these hawk monsters know nothing



Because St.Louis Fed Chair Jim Bullard uttered some truth bombs...



...&quot;it&#x27;s natural that [The Fed] has tilted a little bit more hawkish,&quot;

&quot;Fed Chair Powell has opened the taper discussion this week.&quot;

Yet another piece of the pandemic puzzle has fallen into place - after being hidden in plain sight until it was wiped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology&#x27;s (WIV) website.


Unearthed by The National Pulse&#x27;s Natalie Winters, a Nov. 2017 report titled (no really): &quot;Bats in China carry all the ingredients to make a new SARS virus,&quot; describes how researchers at the WIV had identified &#x27;all the genes to make a SARS coronavirus similar to the epidemic strain,&#x27; among 11 new strains of viruses collected in horseshoe bats.

This week witnessed the first Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since the May truce struck with Hamas after 11 days of fighting and exchange of thousands of rockets and airstrikes. The past days have witnessed incendiary balloons sent from Hamas to southern Israel, for which Tel Aviv has responded by ordering limited airstrikes on the strip.


Al Jazeera reports that the potential for full-blown war is once again on the horizon: 



The Israeli military said its aircraft attacked Hamas compounds in Gaza City and the southern town of Khan Younis and said it was &quot;ready for all scenarios, including renewed fighting in the face of continued terrorist acts emanating from Gaza&quot;.

Rogan took exception with Stelter being incensed that more people were watching shows on YouTube than watching his show, according to Fox News.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


During the confirmation hearings of now Justice Amy Coney Barrett, I repeatedly objected to the clearly false narrative that she was nominated to vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act in the pending case of California v. Texas. The case was highly unlikely to result in such a decision and the Democrats knew it. The case was a focused on a highly technical and limited issues of severability. It would either be resolved on that limited basis or dismissed for standing. While Barrett might view the ACA as unconstitutional (as many do), I noted that she was more likely to dismiss the challenge or sever the individual mandate than to strike down the Act in the case. That is what she did…</span>

An untold story about Amazon&#x27;s workforce is the high turnover rate even before the virus pandemic, according to a new report from The New York Times. 


Many of the over 350,000 workers Amazon hired in 2020 stayed with the company for just a couple of weeks. 



&quot;Even before the pandemic, previously unreported data shows, Amazon lost about 3 percent of its hourly associates each week, meaning the turnover among its work force was roughly 150 percent a year. That rate, almost double that of the retail and logistics industries, has made some executives worry about running out of workers across America,&quot; NYT said.

Authored by David Messler via OilPrice.com,


There are a number of observable trends in oil supplies and by extension prices, presently. I am going to discuss one of them in this article. A lack of capital investment in finding new supplies of oil and gas. A favorite analogy of mine comes to mind, the ship is nearing the dock. In nautical parlance that means the time for course corrections is at an end. So we shall see if that is the case for oil. The massive &quot;ship&quot; that is world oil demand is on an unalterable collision with supplies that will have profound implications for consumers. This key metric reveals what the future is likely to hold for our energy security as the world continues to recover from the virus to those…</span>

All the tumult in Apollo&#x27;s C-suite is starting to impact the firm&#x27;s ability to put capital to work. According to a Bloomberg report published Thursday, with former CEO and co-founder Leon Black out the door and fellow billionaire Jeff Harris only a few steps behind, the firm is scrambling to address a technicality that is nevertheless critical to its ability to continue operating.


It&#x27;s what&#x27;s known as a &quot;Key man&quot; clause. The company&#x27;s record-setting $24.7 billion flagship buyout fund came with a clause attached requiring the firm to get permission from investors to continue operating if two of the three &quot;key men&quot; involved with the project were to depart the firm.

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


White House officials on Thursday brushed off questions about President Joe Biden’s July 4 vaccine goal, which appears to be in jeopardy due to the current vaccination rate.







Asked about the goal during a virtual briefing on Thursday, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients did not say whether the goal could still be met.

In the last month and a half, China has launched the core capsule of the new Tiangong space station and supplies. On Thursday, three astronauts were catapulted into low Earth orbit and successfully docked with the new space station launched in April, according to Nikkei. 


The trio of astronauts - Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming, and Tang Hongbo - were transported in the Shenzhou-12 or &quot;divine vessel&quot; spacecraft on top of a Long March 2F at Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the country&#x27;s northwestern Gobi Desert Thursday morning. By late afternoon local time, state broadcaster CCTV reported the craft had docked with the core capsule.

                    <span>Pentagon Mulls Permanent Naval Task Force To Counter China

            
Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


According to a report from Politico, the Pentagon is considering creating a permanent naval task force for the Pacific region to confront and counter China, which has been identified as the Pentagon’s top priority.


Sources told Politico that the plan would include creating a named military operation for the Pacific that would allow the Pentagon to release more funding for Navy operations in the region.







The Politico report said the naval task force would be based on a Cold War-era NATO construct known as the Standing Naval Forces Atlantic (SNFA) that was established in 1968 and served as a permanent naval presence that would rapidly respond to a situation in the Atlantic. The SNFA usually consisted of a rotating force of about six to 10 ships from NATO countries that would sail around the region.


If the US established such a naval force for the Pacific, it would likely include Washington’s European allies and regional ones such as Japan and Australia.


The idea grew from a 100-day task force review of the Pentagon’s China policy that was led by Ely Ratner, a special advisor to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.


Ratner is a China hawk who came from the interventionist Center for a New American Security think tank. He was appointed to his position to appease China hawks who did not believe Austin had enough experience dealing with Asia.


Last week, Austin ordered the Pentagon to adopt initiatives recommended by the China task force review. Most of the recommendations are being kept classified, but Austin’s directive ordered the military to start acting like China is the top &quot;threat&quot; facing the US instead of just talking about it.


A US official told Defense One that the task force found a &quot;say-do-gap&quot; between what the Pentagon is saying about China and the action it is taking.

Is he thinner, leaner and healthier? Or is he gaunt and sickly?

Or is it stress due to the worsening food and economic crisis in the country? Perhaps he&#x27;s just really hitting that treadmill hard.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday announced that all Floridians who were were arrested or fined for violating mask mandates or social distancing requirements will be pardoned.







In a 3-1 vote, the four-member Board of Executive Clemency approved the Republican governor’s decision to officially pardon those who were arrested or fined for violating local government orders.



“This action is necessary so that we can recover, have a good transition to normal operations, and also just a recognition that a lot of this stuff was way, way overboard,” DeSantis said of the move.

Despite the fact that Covid restrictions are somewhat undergoing the process of being lifted, people sure do still seem ornery.


For proof, look no further than a United Airlines plane at San Francisco International Airport, where two passengers had to be removed from the plane after an argument over elbow room on an armrest. Maybe airlines should take note of what these disruptions cost as they figure out new and creative ways to cram economy flyers even closer together. 


Google product director Jack Krawczyk documented the spat on Twitter, writing: “On my first flight in 15 months, of course we were rerouted back to the gate because two passengers got into a physical altercation over elb…</span>

Authored by Jack Posobiec via Human Events,


Following the criminal indictment of a fellow officer, the entire Portland Police Rapid Response Team made the unanimous decision to resign, according to police sources via Portland news outlet KXL.  







Cory Budworth, 40, is the first officer in the county to be prosecuted for using force during a violent protest. 


The Rapid Response Team is a group of volunteer officers who respond to civil disobedience, demonstrations and riots. At the time of the incident, Officer Budworth was assigned to the Rapid Response Team for crowd control. 


Indeed, Budworth was indicted for breaking up an Antifa riot in 2020, charge…</span>

&quot;There is now a serious possibility that China seeks to occupy one of the outer islands,&quot; a Sydney-based defense analyst tells Bloomberg in a new report about Beijing&#x27;s eyeing Pratas Island in the South China Sea (or Dongsha in Chinese), which though under Taiwan&#x27;s control actually lies closer to the Chinese mainland and has been long claimed by Beijing. 


China&#x27;s PLA military has lately launched almost daily surveillance flights over or near the disputed atoll, which remains uninhabited except crucially for a small forward base of Taiwanese marines and coast guard officers. 


Pratas is back in the spotlight particularly after on Tuesday the PLA flew a record 28 fighter jets into Taiwan&#x27;s defense id…</span>

Every sheriff in the state of Utah signed a letter saying they would try to safeguard the Second Amendment in the midst of proposed legislation and recent executive orders authorized by President Joe Biden.



“Importantly, the Second Amendment of our divinely inspired Constitution clearly states … ‘the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed,’” said the statement (pdf), signed by all 29 sheriffs in the state, and was released via Cache County Sheriff Chad Jensen’s office.

                    <span>Gov. Abbot Announces $250 Million &quot;Down Payment&quot; For Texas Border Wall 

            
Ahead of former President Trump&#x27;s visit to Texas&#x27; southern border with Gov. Greg Abbott on June 30, Abbott announced Wednesday his administration would provide $250 million in state funds as a &quot;down payment&quot; to construct the wall in the state, according to The Texas Tribune. 


During Trump&#x27;s first term, his administration pledged to construct a wall along the southern border, but only 450 miles of the new wall was completed by the end of his term. 







On the other hand, the Biden administration terminated the national emergency on the border and returned $2 billion of Department of Defense funds that were intended for border projects.

One day after the shockingly hawkish Fed admitted that inflation is not, in fact, transitory as so many clueless propaganda hacks would want everyone to believe, and pulled up the liftoff date to early/mid-2023 when it now envisions not one but two rate hikes, traders are watching in stunned amazement at what is going on in the market where contrary to everything the Fed has said, we are seeing a stampede into tech, growth and duration-sensitive names...

Last month, a group of 18 scientists published a letter calling for a deeper investigation into the origins of COVID-19 which would give serious consideration to the lab-leak hypothesis - which posits that the virus escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.







Now, several of those scientists, including MIT and Harvard geneticist Alina Chan, admit that scientists avoided the lab-leak hypothesis because they didn&#x27;t want to be associated with then-President Trump, according to NBC News.

Fed Is Promoting A Public Perception of Inflation That Is False - Fed Admits It In New Forecasts


The Federal Reserve continues to claim that the current run-up in consumer price inflation is &quot;transitory,&quot; pushed higher due to base effects and a temporary burst in pent-up demand as the economy re-opens. Yet, that view is in direct conflict with policymakers&#x27; latest inflation forecast and the inflation data. 


Updated forecasts by the Fed show that policymakers expect consumer inflation to increase 3.4% in 2021, 100 basis points higher than the March forecast and almost double what policymakers p…</span>

After spiking significantly immediately after The Fed&#x27;s so-called &quot;hawkish&quot; statement, the long-end of the yield curve collapsed today with 30Y yields down 17bps from the post-FOMC highs before finding some support as investors may be interpreting the Fed’s hawkish tilt Wednesday as a sign that an extended US post-pandemic economic expansion may be a bit harder to achieve in a potentially emerging environment of less accommodative monetary policy....

What If the Media Had Told the Truth? Five MSM Lies for Which Trump Has Been Vindicated, and the Damage They Caused


Remember that time when the mainstream media lied about former President Donald J. Trump, only to have Trump proven correct afterwards?


“Can you be more specific,” you ask?


Good point.


There are so many to mention, we need to be more precise, so let’s narrow the list down to five, and let’s consider the true impact of their dishonesty.

We warned earlier in the week that Friday&#x27;s $2 trillion gamma expiration would spark chaos...



According to an update from McElligott, a massive ~35% of SPX options Gamma will drop-off tomorrow, 52% of QQQ, 61% of IWM and 54% of EEM.


These are staggering numbers and explains why we had a market-wide gamma meltup this morning, which however is set to end with a bang tomorrow when it all reverses.


...the poster-child in this latest iteration of the Equities &#x27;Short Vol&#x27; movement - the &#x27;Gamma Hammer&#x27; - was back both before-and-after the Fed and selling even more short-dated SPX strangles, which in-turn, back-filled the Street with more “Gamma” and created Equities to BUY into any pullback...

Authored by Ron Ross via AmericanThinker.com,


As Bishop Joseph Butler said in 1736, &quot;probability is the very guide of life.&quot;


The coronavirus has generated more blind fear than perhaps any other event in recorded history.  That fear is blind because it ignores easily calculated probabilities.


The reported coronavirus deaths in the U.S. now stand at six hundred thousand.  The population of the U.S. is approximately 330 million.  When you divide deaths by the population, the number is less than two tenths of one percent.  As catastrophes go, that is a relatively small number.


There is a wide disparity of coronavirus deaths among age groups.

Puerto Rico&#x27;s troubled power utility is attempting to overhaul its grid and is already off to a terrible start. 


More than 337,000 customers were plunged into darkness across the Caribbean island and unincorporated U.S. territory late Wednesday. Infuriating many customers after a cyberattack and major fire resulted in a massive outage last week. 


According to AP News, Luma Energy, a private company that is now managing the island&#x27;s power transmission and distribution system, had &quot;three units were knocked offline for reasons not immediately known.&quot;

By John Gallagher, of Freight Waves,


Brokers booking freight on behalf of their customers say they have no choice but to pass through charges assessed by ocean carriers — charges that some shippers claim are unjustified.







That was one of the main takeaways from the only three public comments filed in response to an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) in April.


The National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America (NCBFAA), the New York New Jersey Foreign Freight Forwarders &amp; Brokers Association (NYNJ/FFF&amp;BA), and the Association of Food Industries (AFI) weighed in on an issue that has been one of the biggest criticisms of U.S. expor…</span>

Earlier this month, we told readers, &quot;Lumber Prices Slump As Historic Boom Hits A Wall,&quot; as sawmills were catching up with the flurry of demand from North American homebuilders amid supply chain issues, which created massive supply constraints, which propelled lumber prices to record highs. 


Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank&#x27;s chief commodity strategist, said the plunge in lumber prices might spiral down some more as speculators exit their positions and supply catches up with demand.

                    <span>Daily Briefing: Commodities Plunge as NASDAQ Holds Firm

            
Senior editor Ash Bennington and editor Jack Farley welcome Real Vision’s new interim managing editor Samuel Burke to the Daily Briefing. The trio cover the big declines in commodities such as gold, oil, and soybeans alongside a rally in the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond and technology stocks. In the crypto world, Burke inspects the World Bank’s rejection of El Salvador’s request to use Bitcoin as legal tender, and Bennington updates viewers on the utter collapse of a stablecoin known as Titan. Farley and Burke also take a look at OnlyFans’ exploration to sell shares as well as the Bank of America’s fund managers survey, which shows that the majority of portfolio managers agree with the Federal Reserve that inflation will be transitory.

Authored by Tsvetana Paraskova via OilPrice.com,


“Incredible demand,” inflation, and shareholder pressure on oil supermajors to drastically cut emissions could lead to an oil crisis within three years, with very high oil and gasoline prices, David Tawil, president of Maglan Capital, told Fox Business on Wednesday.







Tawil has been very bullish on oil for some time, and thinks that the prices could hit $100 per barrel soon.


In the near term, oil prices have more room to rise, both from inflationary standpoint but also from demand standpoint, he told Fox Business.


Oil prices are set to rise “consistently and considerably now into the end of the year,” Tawil said.


Moreover, supply from the oil…</span>

                    <span>Fed&#x27;s Reverse Repo Soars To Stunning $756 Billion, Spikes By $230 Billion Overnight

            
While it received far less attention that the Fed&#x27;s dot plot, the only thing that the Fed actually did change yesterday were its administered rates, as it raised the rate on its overnight Reverse Repo facility from 0% to 0.05% and the rate on excess reserves (IOER) from 0.10% to 0.15%.







Since the RRP hike meant the GC rate would also have to increase, we noted last night that &quot;with both market rates and RRP at .05%, there&#x27;s really no economic incentive for cash investors to move cash to the Repo market.&quot;


Furthermore, now that the Fed is actually paying counterparties a modest but non-negligible 5bps on reserve deposits, it has made the RRP even more attractive compared to when …</span>

                    <span>&quot;Incredibly Busy Summer&quot; - US IPOs Hit Annual Record In Six Months 

            
The Federal Reserve continues to risk its credibility every month by anchoring interest rates near zero and purchasing $120 billion in bonds. The Fed&#x27;s bond-buying program has created ample liquidity during the pandemic by keeping interest rates low, suppressing volatility across multiple asset classes, which has resulted in boom times for financial markets.  


As a result of the Fed&#x27;s easy money policies, stocks are at record highs, and equity valuations are considered at nosebleed levels. This has created optimism for US initial public offerings - where companies have already raised $171 billion, eclipsing all of 2020 of $168 billion, according to a new report via Dealogic.

                    <span>Peter Schiff: Was This Fed Meeting Really &quot;Hawkish&quot;?

            
Via SchiffGold.com,


The Federal Reserve wrapped up its June meeting. While the central bank didn’t raise rates, the messaging coming out of the FOMC was widely viewed as hawkish. But was it really?







Peter Schiff doesn’t think so. In fact, he characterized the Fed’s messaging as extremely dovish. And the fact that it continues to ignore inflation doesn’t bode well for the future.


Most of the media attention focused on the fact that the Fed pushed up its projection for interest rate increases into 2023. But the Fed made no substantive policy changes. And it didn’t even indicate when it would reel in quantitative easing, although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did acknowledge that the committee discussed the ma…</span>

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Podcast king Joe Rogan issued a stark warning this week concerning the ongoing leftist campaign to defund police departments all over the country, noting that the U.S. could soon resemble Mexico if it continues.







“Cops don’t do anything if someone jumps into someone’s backyard, they don’t arrest them — like, you have to do like $900 worth of theft before they’ll even arrest you,” Rogan said, adding “If they do arrest you, they’ll just put you right back out on the street again.”


Rogan noted that things have gotten worse “after the defunding.”

Hong Kong has within a mere couple years gone from packed streets to silence - as The Guardian has observed following the national security law and mainland China crackdown going deep into effect, given also the arrests and exiling of young protest leaders. One UK-based photojournalist laments that &quot;With no protests left to photograph, it seemed a good idea to take a break... But it was with a heavy heart that I watched the situation continue to deteriorate from afar.&quot;


And then the streets grew eerily calm after a couple years of mass protest and unrest: &quot;In January 2021, the authorities arrested dozens of activists under the national security law. In one fell swoop, i…</span>

We previewed last week to readers that port congestion wasn&#x27;t just observed across US West Coast ports, such as Los Angeles/Long Beach, but also severe congestion was developing in southern China. At the time, we called it a &quot;perfect storm&quot; ahead of the peak shipping season. 


Now the world&#x27;s largest container line, Maersk, calls the port congestion at Yantian International Container Terminal, a deepwater port in Shenzhen, Guangdong, in southern China, a much more significant disruption to its operations than the shutdown of the Suez Canal in March.

Authored by Patricia Tolson via The Epoch Times,


On June 9, The Epoch Times reported how Florida was the number one state in the nation for people to move to, while New York and California took first and second place respectively for states that have the most people leaving. To those moving to Florida from blue states, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd says: “Do me a favor,” and “don’t vote the way the majority of the people voted from where you came or you’ll have here what you had there. Guaranteed.”







One of the reasons cited by those fleeing their blue state hometowns was the rising crime rates. According to Judd, the escalation in crime rates are …</span>

US food banks in Republican states are preparing for a massive demand surge in food aid this summer as 24 GOP-led states are set to end federal unemployment assistance before they&#x27;re set to expire on Sept. 6. 


The benefits set to lapse include the additional $300 weekly federal supplement and other Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programs that support low-income households. The policies have also contributed to a historic labor shortage after millions of people received more money via government benefits to staying at home than actually work.

Under the headline, “You May Be Paying a Higher Tax Rate than a Billionaire,” ProPublica is running the latest iteration of the left’s claim that “the rich” don’t pay their “fair share” of taxes, to help gin up support for raising their taxes. It compares (illegally obtained) tax returns for 25 top wealthy people with those for a supposedly “typical” worker with a wage income of $45,000, concluding that those rich paid a total tax rate of 16.0%, but the typical worker paid 19.3%.







Inconsistent with other sources


However, ProPublica gets very different results than far more credible sources.

                    <span>Military Investigators Baffled By Stolen Box Of Armor-Piercing Grenades

            
The US military&#x27;s vast supply chain is susceptible to theft. Thirty armor-piercing grenades went missing last year and were recently found behind a residential house. 


In 2017, rail freight company CSX Corp. hauled ammo shipping containers from Florida to Pennsylvania. Someone broke into the container along the line and stole one box of 40mm armor-piercing grenades used in a Mk 19 grenade launcher. 


The ammo box was eventually found in an Atlanta neighborhood months later, February 2018. Christopher Zachery told NPR News he found the box that read: &quot;Cartridges for weapons.&quot; Inside were 30 armor-piercing grenades.

Authored by Kyle Ward via The Mises Institute,


Peter Schiff is a well-known critic of Bitcoin, and while he is an excellent resource on many economic and political topics, he misses the mark on cryptocurrency.


To be fair, he is right that Bitcoin and other crypto assets are high risk and volatile, and he correctly points out that using leverage or going into debt to buy Bitcoin could end in financial disaster. However, he makes several errors in his analysis of Bitcoin. 


He is wrong about its scarcity and its ability to hedge inflation, but his largest mistake is his guiding principle: that Bitcoin (unlike gold) has no fundamental value.







For example, Schiff is quick to point out that gold has uses…</span>

                    <span>As Iranians Head To Polls Friday, Meet The Hardliner Likely To Succeed Rouhani

            
Iran&#x27;s presidential election which will see a new leader in office as Hassan Rouhani steps down due to term limits is once again pitting Islamic hardliners against centrists or &quot;moderates&quot;. Rouhani himself has long represented the moderate faction, striking the 2015 nuclear deal with the West and currently seeking its restoration through the Vienna negotiations. But this chapter looks to imminently come to an end.


Iranians head to the polls on Friday, June 18, in a race that&#x27;s boiling down between ultraconservative Ebrahim Raisi - currently the head of the judiciary - against his main rival Abdolnaser Hemmati, a centrist former head of of the Central Bank of Iran. A close ally of Ayatollah Kh…</span>

For a moment, I would like you to take an imaginary tour of a major U.S. city with me, and I would like for you to try to guess which city I am talking about.  







As you stroll along the sidewalks in the heart of this city, it seems like tents have been erected everywhere.  


Homelessness is completely and utterly out of control in this particular city, and even though city officials keep making more promises the crisis just continues to get worse.  As you continue your tour, you notice multiple addicts doing drugs right in front of you.

Like Bloomberg&#x27;s Joshua Brustein pointed out in a column published earlier, as a general rule, FTC appointments don&#x27;t attract much press interest. And yet the confirmation of Lina Khan as a member of the FTC, and subsequent announcement from the White House that she would be tapped to lead the Commission, has proved a notable exception.


More than four years have passed since Khan wrote her groundbreaking paper criticizing the present American anti-monopoly legal framework, arguing that policies and laws must change for the US to keep big tech from destroying jobs, cornering markets and hoovering up profits. It was that paper, &quot;Amazon&#x27;s Antitrust Paradox,&quot; that caught the Trump Administration&#x27;s attentio…</span>

Authored by Thomas Lifson via AmericanThinker.com,


If Donald Trump decides to run for president again in 2024, there is little doubt that the GOP nomination is his for the taking. His support among the party faithful is so overwhelming that it is impossible to see anyone else winning primaries or caucuses. So, the question is whether or not he wants to run.  Like all good showmen, Trump understands that suspense holds the public’s attention, so don’t look for him to clear things up for us by offering a definite yes or now anytime soon. He knows that if he were to announce he is not running, there would be far less attention paid to him, and that is not Trump’s idea of a good thing.


Yet, if Trump has inwardly de…</span>

This week, a quiet milestone in the changing nature of the asset-management industry passed without much notice from the heavily preoccupied financial press - and no, we&#x27;re not talking about Invesco&#x27;s latest volley in the buy-side fee wars. 


On Monday, Dimensional Fund Advisors converted $29 billion in mutual funds into ETFs via Citigroup, one of Wall Street&#x27;s biggest transfer agents, which served as the intermediary for the transaction. Now, executives in Citi&#x27;s ETF business are babbling to Bloomberg about how the slow decline of the mutual fund industry (in favor of faster, cheaper ETFs) is about to kick into hyperdrive.

Authored by Simon Black via SovereignMan.com,


More than twenty years ago when I was a young Army intelligence officer fresh out of the academy, my commander summoned me to his office one afternoon because he had a ‘special mission’ for me.


I was beyond excited.


My assumption was that it would be a clandestine assignment to lead one of our unit’s counterintelligence teams in the Middle East. Or perhaps it would be temporary duty as an aide to the commanding general who would be visiting soon.


It was none of the above.


Instead, my commander looked at me and said, “Lieutenant, I need you to plan our unit’s long-term budget for the next ten years, and I want it on my desk this afternoon.”


Huh?

President Biden finished fielding questions following his solo press conference after today&#x27;s some two-and-a-half hour long bilateral summit with Putin in Geneva (shorter than widespread expectations). Just as he was walking away from the podium, reporters in the press pool continued shouting him down with questions. It seems many weren&#x27;t satisfied with his apparently more amicable and conciliatory than expected stance on Putin and Russia generally.


Specifically it seems some were disappointed that he didn&#x27;t personally condemn Putin with harsher language, and that&#x27;s when this unexpected scene played out... &quot;What the Hell?&quot; the US President shouted back at CNN&#x27;s Kaitlan Collins after she got his at…</span>

Dear Mr. Powell,


Fed is holding rates at zero and buying $120 billion in bonds every month in the face of 17.4% export price inflation, 11.3% import price inflation, 6.6% producer price inflation, 5% consumer price inflation, over 15 million Americans on government dole, over 9 million job openings for Americans, record high stock prices, record low homebuyer sentiment, banks are puking excess cash back to The Fed at record levels, and stagflation&#x27;s shadow is looming...

                    <span>Tropical Disturbance Could Pose Threat To US Gulf States 

            
We told readers earlier this week that the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is tracking three tropical disturbances. The most severe tropical threat at the moment is developing in the western Gulf of Mexico. 







NHC&#x27;s 0800 ET update specifies the low-pressure area over the Bay of Campeche and southern Mexico will begin to move northward on Thursday. It could become a tropical depression by Friday over the western Gulf of Mexico.



&quot;Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue over the Bay of Campeche and southern Mexico in association with a broad low pressure area. This system will move little today and tonight, and little if any development is expected during that time due to interaction with land. However, the broad disturbance should begin to move northward on Thursday, and a tropical depression is likely to form by late Thursday or on Friday when the low moves across the western Gulf of Mexico. Regardless of development, heavy rainfall will continue over portions of Central America and southern Mexico during the next several days. Heavy rains should also begin to affect portions of the northern Gulf Coast on Friday,&quot; NHC statement read. 



The system has a 90% chance of formation over the next five days. Computer forecast models aren&#x27;t entirely sure on the track of the system but is likely to strike somewhere along the northern Gulf Coast. 







Readers may recall this hurricane season could be very active.


Refinitiv estimates around &quot;17 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes are expected from June-November. This compares to historical averages of 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes, respectively.&quot;







The 2021 hurricane season could be off to a busy start.

                    <span>What Makes The Fed So Special

            
Just minutes before the FOMC announcement, Deutsche&#x27;s Jim Reid notes that it’s interesting that we are debating whether the median dot will show the first hike slightly before the start of 2024 or after it. So we’re arguing over something that may or may not take place in plus or minus 30 months.


However as the chart from Reid shows, we have already tentatively started a global hiking cycle, so the Fed are looking set to be well behind the global cycle assuming it is sustained.







Which brings us to a key question from Reid which most have glossed over: &quot;Given that the US has arguably seen the biggest monetary and fiscal stimulus of anywhere in the world over the last year or so and given the output gap will be closed over the next few quarters (it took until 2017 post-GFC), what makes the Fed so special that they can wait as long as they plan?&quot;


As another DB strategist, Alan Ruskin, shows in a recent piece out of 45 countries the US stands out near the top of the global inflation charts across different criteria...







... something normally the exclusive domain of EM countries, a few of which have now started raising rates. The Fed will have no choice but to follow as soon as the idiotic &quot;transitory&quot; vs &quot;permanent&quot; narrative fades away.

Real Vision senior editor Ash Bennington hosts Real Vision’s Ed Harrison and Jack Farley to break down an action-packed day as Fed Chair Jerome Powell responds to mounting inflationary pressure with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluding their two-day policy meeting. The group covers how the market participants are reacting in real time, not only to the Fed’s direct actions but also their forward projections of interest rates (known as “the dot plot”) as well as their estimates for future economic growth and inflation.

update(1:20pm): Now Biden&#x27;s turn in what&#x27;s expected to be a much more scripted presser, complete with teleprompter. Biden says he &quot;made it clear&quot; to Putin that we’ll continue to raise fundamental issues of human rights, referencing jailed dissident Alexei Navalny.


He raised the issue of imprisoned Americans in Russia, including ability of US-funded Radio Free Europe to report freely. Biden also cited positive talks of &quot;mutual interests&quot; where we can cooperate, especially on strategic stability. There were detailed discussions steps to reduce unintended conflict, particularly nuclear arms control and reduction. Biden also says he brought up Ukraine and Belarus, and stre…</span>

Tucker Carlson dropped several bombshells on his show Tuesday night, chief among them was from a Revolver News report that the FBI was likely involved in organizing the Jan. 6 Capitol &#x27;insurrection,&#x27; and were similarly involved in the kidnapping plot against Michigan Governor Gretchin Whitmer.







&quot;Why are there so many factual matters that we don&#x27;t understand about that day?&quot; asked Carlson.


&quot;Why is the Biden administration preventing us from knowing? Why is the administration still hiding more than 10,000 hours of surveillance tape from the US capitol on January 6th?

Ahead of tomorrow&#x27;s FOMC decision, and in general, two clear camps are emerging when it comes to the increasingly acrimonious debate whether the current soaring inflation is &quot;transitory&quot; or not. In one camp we have the establishmentarians: those with little vision, limited imagination, and whose job precludes them from conceiving of any outcome but that accepted by the groupthink led by the Fed. As noted earlier, this now includes the vast majority of Wall Street...

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


The media has given highly favorable coverage to a new book by Dr. Carol Anderson, chair of Emory University’s Black Studies Department, that argues that “[the Second Amendment] was designed and has consistently been constructed to keep African Americans powerless and vulnerable.” 


In interviews with media outlets like CNN and NPR Anderson’s theory is not challenged on the history and purpose of the Second Amendment.


Like the contested claims of the “1619” project (which posited that slavery was the motivation for the establishment of the colonies), there might be a reluctance by academics to raise the countervailing historical sources out of fear of being…</span>

Just days after we noted that people in South Korea saw bitcoin as their &quot;only chance of escape&quot; from their social status, it looks as though non-fungible tokens are also catching on in Southeast Asia. 


At least that was the topic of a new report by Nikkei, which took at look at how skeptics and believers are clashing head-to-head about NFTs, whether they have any value and whether or not they could be the future of asset ownership and finance.

Mike Fratantuono grew up in a restaurant. Literally.


For decades, Sunset Restaurant in Glen Burnie, Maryland, was the family business. Over the years, he’d done seemingly every job imaginable: busboy, bartender, and butcher; prep cook and plumber; handyman and manager.


Fratantuono says that’s what made it so hard to watch the family’s legacy become a COVID casualty in 2020.

                    <span>Ceasefire Over? Israeli Jets Attack After Incendiary Balloons Fired From Gaza

            
The Israeli military said its aircraft attacked Hamas armed compounds in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday in response to 20 fires sparked by incendiary balloons launched earlier in the day from the territory into southern Israel.





At least one explosive balloon was reported over southern Israel, with residents reporting that they saw and heard the balloon explode in the air, according to Israeli media.


In a statement, the military said that it was &quot;ready for all scenarios, including renewed fighting in the face of continued terrorist acts emanating from Gaza&quot;.

— وكالة شهاب للأنباء (@ShehabAgency) June 15, 2021


Israel&#x27;s new prime minister, Naftali Bennett, had said in the past that the Israeli government should not tolerate incendiary balloons, and must retaliate as if Hamas had fired rockets into Israel.







The escalation came after an Israeli nationalist march, as part of &quot;Jerusalem Day&quot; in East Jerusalem that angered Palestinians.







 


Crowds waving blue and white Israeli flags set off from Damascus Gate, the main entry to the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City, dancing and chanting &quot;This is our home&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem is ours.&quot;







Iron Dome anti-missile defense units were also reinforced ahead of the march, amid threats by Hamas in recent days and weeks.


On Tuesday evening, Defense Minister Benny Gantz held a situation assessment with IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi, Shin Bet head Nadav Argaman, IDF Intelligence Directorate head Maj.-Gen. Tamir Heiman, IDF intelligence analysis chief Brig.-Gen. Amit Saar and Defense Ministry Policy and Political-Military Bureau head Zohar Palti.


Is the Egyptian-brokered cease-fire officially over?

Authored by Jack Phillips via the Epoch Times


Hundreds of people were administered doses of expired COVID-19 vaccines during an event in New York City’s Times Square, city health officials authorities said.


The New York City Health Department confirmed that 899 individuals got Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine at the former NFL Experience building between June 5 and June 10.







A spokesperson for the department told news outlets on Tuesday that those people should schedule another vaccination session as soon as possible.



“We have communicated with Pfizer, which recommended that the patients receive another dose as soon as possible,” the spokesperson said in statements to the media outlets. “While…</span>

                    <span>Copper Futures Plunge To Seven-Week Low As Base Metals Slip-On Fed, China Demand Woes 

            
...time to ignore Dr.Copper once again!?


Copper prices plunged on Tuesday to their lowest levels in seven weeks over concerns about Federal Reserve&#x27;s monetary tightening and a pull-back in Chinese demand. 


From aluminum to copper to lead to nickel to tin to zinc, the entire base metal complex is down anywhere from 2-4%.







Focusing on copper, future prices on the London Metal Exchange are down 4% to their lowest levels in seven weeks. Three-month LME copper futures were trading around $6,563 per ton, down 11% in 25 trading sessions since topping at $10,747 in early May.

How soon we forget...







It was 24 years ago this summer that Steve Jobs was coaxed back to Apple. The only thing was that investors weren’t interested. Titans of tech at the time like Michael Dell dismissed Apple’s long-term potential, and said the company’s assets should quite simply be sold off ahead of it folding altogether.


Apple nearly died, but for a $150 million investment care of Bill Gates.


Funnily enough Netflix opened its doors right around the time that Jobs returned to Apple. The reaction from investors was somewhat similar. The DVD-by-Mail company’s prospects were once so questionable that it tried twice to sell itself to Blockbuste…</span>

                    <span>Meanwhile... At A San Francisco Walgreens

            
One of California&#x27;s biggest blunders has been the passage of Proposition 47, which lowered penalties for thefts under $950 and sparked dramatic increases in shoplifting across the metro area over the last several years. Otherwise known as Prop. 47, it&#x27;s supported by social justice warriors and criminal justice reformers, and the liberal establishment, who have also managed to defund the local police. 


The effects of allowing chaos to prevail in liberal-run San Fransico have resulted in 17 Walgreens Pharmacy locations shuttering their doors in the past five years, and at least ten since 2019.

                    <span>Pennsylvania Public Schools Received More COVID Aid Than Healthcare Providers

            
Authored by Adam Andrzejewski via RealClearPolicy.com,


While the country fought a deadly pandemic for more than a year and schools remained closed, the education system in Pennsylvania received more federal aid than health care systems did.


The Keystone State collected more than $34 billion in federal aid, including through the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan Act, according to the think tank Commonwealth Foundation.







But the bulk of that money did not go to the Department of Health, Medicaid programs, assisted living and nursing homes, vaccine distribution, hospitals, and other healthcare providers.


Public education received 29% ($10.1 billion) of the aid, while 24% ($8.2 billion) went to healthcare.


The Pennsylvania-based think tank found that while nursing homes received $944 million in grants from the Covid-19 aid bills, the Philadelphia School District alone got $1.8 billion.


Students were learning remotely - from home - or in a hybrid of school/home learning for most, if not all, the school year. Why did schools get $10.1 billion in federal aid on top of their annual state and federal aid?


The health system in Pennsylvania and the rest of the country struggled, and in some cases, failed, to provide adequate care during the pandemic. They should get the bulk of the Covid-19 funding, not special interests, which shuttered schools and stunted students’ growth.

President Biden on Wednesday said he&#x27;s feeling &quot;very good&quot; following the bilateral meeting with Turkey&#x27;s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but both sides have remained tight lipped about what was actually discussed in the Monday meeting on the sidelines of the one-day NATO summit.


US-Turkey relations were already at a low point going into the meeting, particularly after the Biden administration&#x27;s formal recognition of the Armenian Genocide. But when asked by a reporter about the meeting, Biden declined to divulge any details:



President Joe Biden on Tuesday declined to offer details about his one-on-one meeting with Turkish President Recep Erdogan, saying he&#x27;d let the Turks talk about it.

Ignoring long-term problems can work for a while, but eventually they catch up with you...







Over the years, I have written many articles about alarming long-term trends in our society that desperately needed to be addressed.  Of course the vast majority of those long-term trends never got much attention, because our political system tends to reward politicians that focus on short-term issues.  As a result, many of the long-term trends that I have written about previously have now gotten to a point where they have started to become very serious short-term problems.  In this article, I would like to sh…</span>

Oil prices extended their recent (meteoric) rise with WTI topping $72 - 32 month highs - as investors weighed the outlook for rising demand (hopes on gasoline and aviation fuel use rise from pandemic lows and global stockpiles are drawn down) against extended anti-virus curbs in some economies (with officials tackling the challenge posed by more infectious variants).



&quot;The continuing good news on the demand front and upbeat sentiment on the financial markets as the key reasons for the latest upswing,&quot; Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg said in a note.

As worries about the spread of deadly COVID variants prompts the UK to delay plans to reopen its economy, in the US, it&#x27;s full steam ahead as more major states announced reopening measures on Tuesday, while the number of confirmed COVID deaths in the country topped 600K.


Daily US cases and deaths have fallen substantially as the percentage of the adult population that has been vaccinated has climbed. Now, with some states hitting their thresholds for herd immunity, they&#x27;re loosening the yoke of repressive restrictions that were justified for more than a year because of COVID.

Having broken its 4-month streak of buying in March (the longest streak since 2017), China sold US Treasuries for the second straight month in April (the latest TIC data available), down to fall to $1.096trn in April from $1.100trn in March...

But, Japan’s holdings increased in April by $36.4b to $1.277t

But, perhaps the most notable aspect of today&#x27;s TIC data was that for the first time since April 2020, Foreigners sold US equities in April... (and that was the biggest net selling since August 2019 when we had the repo crisis and NOT QE)...







Additionally, the last twelve months&#x27; transactions in TSYs by foreign central banks just turned positive for the first time since Feb 2015...







Overall in April:




	
Foreign net buying of Treasuries at $49.6b

	

	

	
Foreign net selling of equities at $13.3b

	

	

	
Foreign net buying of corporate debt at $10.1b

	

	

	
Foreign net buying of agency debt at $46.8b

	







And finally, despite the 12mth net buying, the recent trend of rotation into Treasury reserves from gold may have just reverted...

Following the latest hot inflationary print, more investors are becoming skeptical of the Fed&#x27;s view that inflationary pressures are &quot;transitory&quot;. Yesterday, famed investor Paul Tudor Jones lamented the deluge of money pumped into the financial system by fiscal and monetary policymakers, and warned that markets might go &quot;bat sh*t crazy&quot; after Wednesday&#x27;s FOMC press conference, which PTJ believes could be the most important meeting of Chair Jerome Powell&#x27;s tenure, as the Fed sees its grip on a rapidly overheating economy start to slip.

The New York Times faced a stinging contradiction from Politico this week after it ran a story besmirching the lead prosecutor in the leak investigation launched under former Attorney General Bill Barr.


The article relies on anonymous sources to claim that Assistant U.S. Attorney Osmar Benevenuto of the District of New Jersey was brought in by Barr as part of his “small circle of trusted aides officials.” 


In reality, it appears that Benevenuto was not initially selected by Barr and does not appear to have known him.







Here is what the New York Times wrote:

                    <span>An Apparently Confused Biden Goes Silent After Fielding Question About Putin

            
More clips have surfaced which highlight Biden&#x27;s apparent difficulty in handling unscripted back-and-forth discussion during his ongoing foreign policy focused Europe trip. As early as the weekend at the G-7 the Associated Press had noticed a &quot;handful of verbal stumbles&quot; the US president made. As we also highlighted there would be more to come. And then at his big Monday night NATO summit presser, there was the following bizarre moment...



Vladimir Putin laughed at the suggestion that you had called him a &#x27;killer,&#x27;&quot; a CNN reporter asked. &quot;Is that still your belief, sir, that he is a killer?&quot;


The reporter followed with a second question, also asking, &quot;Do you believe if he does agree to coop…</span>

                    <span>Jon Stewart Hijacks Colbert Show With Lab-Leak Rant, Liberal Twitter Explodes

            
Comedian Jon Stewart overpowered Stephen Colbert&#x27;s ability to shill on Monday, hijacking the Late Show&#x27;s return to a live (and fully vaccinated) audience with an epic rant on the COVID-19 lab-leak theory.







&quot;I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to science. Science has, in many ways, helped ease the suffering of this pandemic, which was more than likely caused by science,&quot; Stewart said after Colbert asked how he was feeling about the scientific response to COVID-19.


&quot;Do you mean perhaps there’s a chance that this was created in a lab?&quot; asked Colbert, adding &quot;There&#x27;s an investigation.&quot;


&quot;A chance?&quot; shot back Stewart - kicking the door open.

The Biden administration is taking steps to establish a US uranium reserve, a proposal put forward by the Trump administration which could boost mining of the mineral as well as the potential to expand nuclear energy in the United States.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Pink Floyd song writer Roger Waters slammed Mark Zuckerberg during a press conference recently, announcing that the Facebook owner had offered a “huge, huge amount of money” to use the iconic song Another Brick In The Wall Part II in an advert for Instagram.







Speaking at an event to raise awareness about imprisoned WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, Waters noted the deep deep irony of Facebook wanting to buy and use a song that rails against ‘thought control’ and mindless conformity.


Waters described the development as part of Zuckerberg’s “insidious movement… to take over absolutely everything.”

The Arizona legislature is ready to take action if the election audit taking place in the state’s largest county uncovers irregularities, a state senator said.



“It’ll be our duty to act in whatever way is appropriate,” Arizona Sen. Wendy Rogers, a Republican who has been closely tracking the audit in Maricopa County, told The Epoch Times.



Auditors, led by Florida-based Cyber Ninjas, started reviewing ballots from the 2020 election at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix last month, along with machines used in the contest and other election materials.

Authored by Michael Maharrey via SchiffGold.com,


The Federal Reserve is the engine that drives one of the biggest, most powerful governments in the history of the world.


Without the Fed, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the government to fund its foreign wars, its massive, unsustainable social programs, the ever-growing police state, and the tangled web of corporate welfare programs. It’s almost certain none of this would exist as we know it today – not even close. The federal government would truly be limited.


Although the Federal Reserve is relatively new within the scope of American history, its roots go back to the early days of the republic and the First Bank of the United States, chartered by Congres…</span>

Goldman Sachs employees finally returned to the office this week (for at least part of the work week). But at least some Goldman employees who miss working from the beach, the bank might soon be moving some of its front-office workers from NYC down to sunny Florida, becoming the latest major Wall Street firm to beef up its operations in the Sunshine State.







Goldman will join Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb&#x27;s Third Point, the private equity giant Apollo and a host of other firms in moving more employees to Florida, a state that, among other perks, has no income tax, according to a report published Monday by Insider.  But talk of the bank moving some of its personnel has been circulating since…</span>

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Viterbo University in Wisconsin has been the scene of protests for months over alleged hate crimes committed on campus.  The police however has charged a student, Victoria Unanka, with what it says was a hoax hate crime involving the setting of a fire in her dormitory. What interested me about the case was the curious combination of criminal charges. She is being charged with both arson and “the negligent handling of burning materials.”







The arson occurred during protests over alleged racial incidents on campus. A student complained about racial slurs directed against her. The university cancelled classes and campus-wide demonstrations were held.

Coming off Monday&#x27;s meeting of top NATO leaders in Brussels with Joe Biden, President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued a shock statement, claiming that NATO has &quot;agreed&quot; to admit Ukraine into the military alliance with Biden&#x27;s blessing.


However, in simultaneous remarks given during Biden&#x27;s anticipated press conference, the president actually appeared to suggest nothing has really change. He said Ukraine has more it must do to meet the &quot;criteria&quot; for NATO membership. &quot;It depends on whether they meet the criteria,&quot; Biden told reporters. &quot;The fact is, they still have to clean up corruption... School’s out on that question.&quot;

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have published a study that reveals most of the perpetrators of mass shootings in America are people with undiagnosed psychiatric disorders.







The study focused on 115 assailants of shootings committed between 1982 and 2019, and then narrowed that number down to ones who survived.



“We found that most mass shooters in our study experienced undiagnosed and unmedicated psychiatric illness,” the researchers noted.



Describing the findings as “striking,” the study notes that symptoms of clinical psychiatric disorders were identified in almost all the shooters, 32 out of 35.

Goldilocks will not be pleased. Texas power prices infamously exploded higher during the frigid temperatures of the February winter storm that crippled so much of the state; and this time, amid blisteringly hot temperatures, Texas power prices are exploding higher once again as The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) asks Texans to reduce electric use as much as possible today through Friday, June 18.







ERCOT issued the following Conservation Alert: 



A significant number of forced generation outages combined with potential record electric use for the month of June has resulted in tight grid conditions.

On the fifth anniversary of the PULSE nightclub massacre in Orlando, numerous senators, politicians and activist groups commemorated that tragic event by propagating an absolute falsehood: namely, that the shooter, Omar Mateen, was motivated by anti-LGBT animus. The evidence is definitive and conclusive that this is false — Mateen, like so many others …</span>

Imagine if you had been stuck on a desert island for the past couple of years.  when back at your control center, you ring up GS for a quick check-down on what you (and, your trusty pal Wilson) missed while lost at sea. towards the end of the narrative -- which details the greatest economic collapse since the Depression, followed by the fastest economic recovery in American history -- your coverage person highlights a few present-day realities:

                    <span>Here Comes Another Retail Sales Miss

            
Bank of America&#x27;s economists have been on a roll in the past four months.


Back in February, the bank looked at its credit and debit card spending data and concluded that consensus was far, far too low, predicting that the stimmy-fueled January retail sales print would be above 4.1%.







Not only was BofA&#x27;s outlier forecast right, but the headline retail sales number came in even higher: at a whopping 5.3%, nearly 5x higher than the consensus estimate of a 1.1% rise.


One month later, when the Wall Street herd scrambled to make up for its clueless January forecast by being overly optimistic, Bank of America again took the contrarian approach, not because it wanted to but because that&#x27;s what the data showed: spending on BofA …</span>

On Monday NBC released its full sit-down interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which was initially previewed Friday, just days before Wednesday&#x27;s much anticipated bilateral summit with President Joe Biden. It was the first interview Putin has given to a US network in nearly three years.


During the full interview Putin dismissed the latest major accusations of mounting cyberattacks on US infrastructure as &quot;farcical&quot;. &quot;Where is the proof? It&#x27;s becoming farcical,&quot; Putin questioned, adding, &quot;We have been accused of all kinds of things, election interference, cyberattacks and so on and so forth, and not once, not one time, did they bother to produce any kind of evidence …</span>

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


There has been a great deal of controversy over the graduation address of Fairfax County school board member Abrar Omeish to the Justice High School in Falls Church on June 7th.


In her remarks to the graduates, Omeish praised a teacher who made social activism part of her class and warned the graduates that they are going into a world filled with racism and white supremacy.


However, what really struck an admittedly libertarian chord with me was the third danger that she warned about: “excessive individualism.”  







Like free speech, individualism is now being presented as a danger rather than a strength in our society.


Omeish is a strong speaker w…</span>

A handful of what appears more than the usual Biden gaffes while on his Europe trip has some pundits raising yet more concerns about the 78-year old president&#x27;s cognitive decline in old age. Last year on the campaign trail a series of bizarre and questionable moments of &quot;concern&quot; - all caught on film - were dismissed in mainstream media as pro-Trump conspiracies.

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


Nobody seems to notice the &#x27;diminishing returns&#x27; on Fed manipulation, oops, I mean &#x27;intervention&#x27;.







Perhaps it shouldn&#x27;t surprise us that everything that will eventually matter is ignored until it does matter--but by then it&#x27;s too late. Here&#x27;s a short list to start the discussion:


1. The Federal Reserve has transformed the American populace into a nation of dismayingly over-confident gamblers. I&#x27;ve been writing about moral hazard--the separation of risk from consequence--since 2011. Punters who are insulated from risk will have an insatiable appetite for risky bets, which is precisely what we see on a mass scale, as the confidence that t…</span>

Update (1520ET): As the dangerous chemical fire at Berkshire-owned Chemtool plant in Rockton continued to burn Monday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker activated the State Emergency Operation Center to mobilize emergency response to monitor and suppress a large chemical fire in Winnebago County.







The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and Illinois Emergency Management Agency have already dispatched crews to the area to assist local authorities. The Illinois State Emergency Operations Center in Springfield has also been activated, and members of the Illinois National Guard and mobile response vehicles have been dispatched to the area.

Double Or Nothing


There’s lots to cover today, but let’s start with inflation. Friday’s Michigan consumer sentiment survey saw the headline rise to 86.4 from 82.9 because expectations jumped from 78.8 to 83.8, while current conditions fell; and 1-year ahead inflation expectations dropped from 4.6% back to 4.0%, and five-year inflation from 3.0% to 2.8%, even as the ‘good time to buy a house or car’ sub-indices collapsed due to the inflation being seen in those areas. Perhaps everyone surveyed closely tracks the lumber market, where prices are tumbling; or they instinctively grasp high prices destroy demand; in which case, everything is “transitory”. Like anaesthetic-free dentistry?

                    <span>Quad-Witch Quandary: How Will Friday&#x27;s $2 Trillion Gamma Expiration Impact Markets

            
Last week, when discussing the bizarre summer doldrums in the market which pushed the VIX to the lowest level since the onset of the covid pandemic, we said that this period of abnormal market quiet is likely to last until this Friday&#x27; quad-witch, when a massive amount of gamma and delta expire and are de-risked, in the process eliminating one of the natural downside stock buffers (see &quot;4 Reasons Why The Market Doldrums End With Next Friday&#x27;s Op-Ex&quot;).


So picking up on the topic of Friday&#x27; potentially market-moving opex, Goldman&#x27; in-house derivatives expert, Rocky Fishman, previews June’s upcoming expiration which he dubs as &quot;large - comparable to a typical quarterly.&quot; Specifically, there …</span>

China has reacted fiercely to the final G7 communique issued on Sunday by underscoring that such a &quot;small&quot; group of countries in reality can never decide the fate of the globe. &quot;The days when global decisions were dictated by a small group of countries are long gone,&quot; an official statement from the Chinese embassy in London said.


The embassy further protested the G7 communique over its highlighting China malfeasance from its mention of Taiwan to Hong Kong to Xinjiang, slamming the group of wealthy democracies as interfering in China&#x27;s sovereign affairs. The communique called on Beijing &quot;respect human rights and fundamental freedoms&quot; - which was reportedly language somewhat watered down comp…</span>

Authored by Mike Shedlock via MishTalk.com,


The &quot;quits rate&quot; hit a record 2.7% in April. Private workers quit at a record 3.1% rate...







Quits Levels and Rates


Quits Levels and Rates are part of the BLS&#x27; monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover report.


Quits are the number of quits during the entire month. The quits rate is the number of quits during the entire month as a percent of total employment. 


The quits rates are at the highest level in the history of the series.


People are Just Quitting

Summary: With your meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Geneva just days away, mainstream media are barely reporting – and at times distorting – olive-branch remarks by Putin, and are at pains to &quot;accentuate the negative&quot;. We are particularly concerned over the incessant media commentary on &quot;Russian hacking&quot;, which seems to be aimed at mousetrapping you into an ill-advised confrontation with Putin. Revelations since the last summit in July 2018 – including testimony under oath to Congress – give President Putin some very high cards. Should things get acrimo…</span>

By Greg Miller of FreightWaves,


The extreme consolidation within the container liner sector is the kind of thing owners of tankers and bulk carriers can only dream of. The latest data from Alphaliner highlights the extent of liner consolidation, how soon the rankings will change, and how newbuilding orders will render the carrier arena even more concentrated than it already is.







The top 10 carriers now operate 85% of global shipping capacity. Four groups — Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM and COSCO — control more than half of capacity (58%). The top seven, including Hapag-Lloyd, ONE and Evergreen, control 78%.

The most significant challenge in fighting the virus pandemic has been the political polarization on public health measures. A new CBS News-YouGov poll released Sunday shows Democrats and Republicans remain deeply divided on an employee&#x27;s right to either chose or waive the right to be administered a vaccine. 


CBS News-YouGov poll asked 2,300 adults in the US between June 8-10 a series of questions about today&#x27;s environment in a post-pandemic world. One of the fascinating questions respondents were asked was:

                    <span>UK Extends COVID Lockdown By 4 Weeks Over Fears About &quot;Delta&quot; Mutant

            
Update (1310ET): British President Boris Johnson has expanded the UK&#x27;s controversial COVID-19 lockdown by another four weeks Monday, citing concerns about the &quot;Delta&quot; COVID mutant that first emerged from India. The PM said the delay would allow British adults more time to get vaccinated.


 


&quot;It&#x27;s sensible to wait just a little longer,&quot; the PM said as he claimed that the government is concerned that the link between COVID and hospitalizations &quot;hasn&#x27;t been severed.&quot;


The UK&#x27;s remaining lockdown measures will now expire July 19, BoJo said. Previously, measures were supposed to expire on June 21, a day the government had deemed &quot;Freedom Day&quot;. Instead, the UK will need to wait another month, as BoJo s…</span>

Real Vision senior editor Ash Bennington welcomes Ed Harrison, managing editor at Real Vision, to the Daily Briefing to discuss the market’s reaction to last week’s CPI print as well as Bitcoin’s rebound. The pair will analyze the fall in bond yields and stock market growth as investors anticipate the FOMC meeting scheduled for Tuesday and continued dovish FED policies. Additionally, they will examine Bitcoin’s recent reversal as Paul Tudor Jones and Elon Musk publicly state their support.

Oil prices were volatile this week on headline-driven trade but still managed to grind higher

	

	

	
The latest CPI print came in above expectations again, reinforcing already widespread inflation fears and adding more fuel to the commodity rally

	

	

	
RIN prices have been surging this year, but a headline suggesting the Biden administration is considering options to help refiners sent ethanol RINs and the gasoline crack tumbling Friday

Last Wednesday, when the Fed&#x27;s reverse repo facility hit just shy of half a trillion dollars (it has since risen to a new record $547.8BN), we said that &quot;Wall Street Scrambles To Figure Out What Comes Next&quot; in which we showed that while some banks expect the Fed to hike its IOER and Reverse Repo rates (such as BofA, JPM and Wrightson ICAP), others see the Fed standing pat again (Jefferies, Credit Suisse and BMO), a case bolstered by the WSJ&#x27;s Fed whisperer, Michael Darby, who suggested that the Fed was ok with the reverse repo being at half a trillion, and thus is unlikely to make any changes to its adminstered rates.

By Jack Phillips of The Epoch Times


The top U.S. general warned Thursday that the Chinese regime is increasing its military capacity at a “very serious and sustained rate” and said it could pose a threat to worldwide stability and peace.


Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that it’s necessary the United States “retain our competitive and technological edge” over the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which comes after President Joe Biden and Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin raised similar concerns in recent days about the rhetoric coming from the CCP—as the United States and China have remained intransigent over Taiwan, the CCP’s human rights violations, and dispu…</span>

By Chetan Ahya, Morgan Stanley&#x27;s Chief Economist and Global Head of Economics


The Paradigm Shift


At a recent group dinner, I was asked to identify the most significant development in global macro I had witnessed during my three-year stint in New York. I expect that many people would point to the pandemic and the structural changes it has brought to the ways we work and live. But I think the bigger story is how the pandemic has triggered a paradigm shift in how corporate profits and wages will be distributed within national income. As this mega-trend reverses in the US, the tide will turn in favor of higher inflation and economic cycles will run hotter but shorter, in my view.

A Texas judge tossed out a lawsuit brought by 117 Houston Methodist hospital employees who sought to block the hospital system&#x27;s requirement that all employees receive COVID-19 vaccinations or face suspension and/or termination.

Authored by Ian Birrell via UnHerd (emphasis ours),


Just over a year ago, I stumbled across an intriguing scientific paper. It suggested the pandemic that was ripping around the world was “uniquely adapted to infect humans”; it was “not typical of a normal zoonotic infection” since it first appeared with “exceptional” ability to enter human cells. The author of the paper, Nikolai Petrovsky, was frank about the disease when we spoke back then, saying its adaptability was either “a remarkable coincidence or a sign of human intervention”. He even broke the scientific omertà by daring to admit that “no one can say a laboratory leak is not a possibility”.

In an ironic twist on their mission statement &quot;Sempra Supra&quot; (which could be translated &quot;Always Higher&quot;), a wildlife manager at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS) discovered more than a million dollars worth of cocaine on a beach last month while checking on sea turtle nests, according to local newspaper Florida Today. 


Angy Chambers, a 45th Civil Engineer Squadron wildlife manager conducting sea turtle nesting surveys in late May, found 24 packages, collectively weighing 65 pounds, of cocaine.

“If anyone can do it, then no one should”


It’s always some combination of amusement and frustration when you hear the incessant admonition of crypto-skeptics (crypto-denialists?) who think they’re being original when they come up with this version of FUD (Fear-Uncertainty-Doubt):



“Bitcoin is not a limited supply because people can create an infinite number of crypto currencies! Check mate, crypto-cucks”



This is the “Without government, who will build the roads?” argument of decentralization and crypto. When my last post ran on Zerohedge, the comment section had a lot of this:

Biden capped the G-7 summit with a victorious sounding &quot;America is back at the table&quot; - in what many are noting was an obvious swipe at former President Trump. But many are also observing the whole summit appeared more like a multi-day long photo-op where Biden was formally admitted into being &quot;part of the club&quot;.



French President Emmanuel Macron to Joe Biden: “What we need is cooperation. I think it’s great to have a US President who is part of the club.”

I don’t know about you, but I thought an American President is supposed to LEAD, not be “part of the club”.

Of course, Biden nods. pic.twitter.com/RjzwwLQ8No

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


An election assessment conducted in a Pennsylvania county months ago and quietly released to the public in recent weeks uncovered five errors, including three linked to Dominion Voting Systems, whose election management system is used in the county, the assessing firm said.







Wake Technology Services Inc. (Wake TSI), a Pennsylvania-based firm, conducted the assessment in Fulton County. Workers visited the county’s offices late last year and about a month later, on Feb. 9.


The assessment was meant to review the mail-in ballots in the county and explore whether conduct relating to absentee ballot requests, distribution, receipt, and count…</span>

Though nothing seems to move fast in Israeli politics - after four national votes in two years and multiple failed attempts at forming a governing coalition - Israel&#x27;s longest serving prime minister is finally out for good.


On Sunday Israel&#x27;s parliament voted to approve the new coalition government under Naftali Bennet and Yair Lapid, with Bennet being sworn in as prime minister following the narrow 60-59 vote in Knesset. Netanyahu&#x27;s 12-years in office comes to a close and he now faces criminal charges - no longer under the protection and legal immunity afforded by the PM&#x27;s office - over prior corruption cases.


BBC/Reuters: Naftali Bennett (right) ended Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s long tenure in office.

“The [Bitcoin] volatility we have seen is an unexpected function of what I would call market manipulation by Elon Musk,” said Magda Wierzycka, one of the richest women in South Africa and CEO of financial services company Sygnia.

                    <span>What The Next Gold Confiscation Will Look Like... And How To Protect Yourself

            
Authored by Nick Giambruno via InternationalMan.com,


On April 5, 1933, under the pretext of a national emergency, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for U.S. citizens to own gold.


The decree forced Americans to sell their gold at an artificially low “official price.” If they refused, the government could hit them with stiff penalties: a $10,000 fine (equivalent to $205,000 today) and/or up to 10 years in prison.


The government blatantly stole wealth from the American people.


Many worry the U.S. government might confiscate gold again if it becomes desperate enough. I don’t think those fears are unfounded. The U.S. government’s abysmal fina…</span>

Since a Saturday1:30am mass shooting on Austin&#x27;s crowded 6th street left 14 people wounded, at least two of them critically, there&#x27;s been a manhunt underway for what police said were two suspects. A somewhat desperate and woefully understaffed Austin Police Department (given a prior year-long effort to &quot;defund the police&quot;) urged the public for clues or cell phone videos which might reveal the gunman&#x27;s (or possibly multiple shooters) identity. 


On Sunday late morning Austin PD have announced an arrest has been made of one of the suspects, though few details were given in the statement, which underscored that authorities are still seeking information.

FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers at a hearing Friday that the agency has noted “quite a number” of instances of individuals deeply indebted to Mexican criminal organizations entering the United States, adding that there’s “no question” cartel activity is spilling over the border.

It&#x27;s not surprising that last week&#x27;s 5.0% CPI reading in headline consumer prices year-over-year in May was the fastest pace of increase in more than a decade. The Fed&#x27;s destructive money-pumping of $120 billion of Treasury and GSE debt and supply chain disruptions have unleashed an inflationary monster that Fed members swear is only &quot;transitory.&quot; 


Days ago, BofA economists told their clients that the evidence of shortages and inflation continues to grow with every passing day, as does the list of reasons to reject the problem as purely temporary.

Don’t mess with Texas. Chip Roy, a Republican representative to Congress from the 21st District, including parts of Austin and San Antonio, is taking on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in a big, Texan, way. Chip proposes to ban CCP members from purchasing land in America. It’s a short, sweet, and brilliantly-cutting edge bill that should be voted into law ASAP.

Prices are rising on all types of goods and services across the US. Yet even with retail market participation at all-time highs, fee competition among asset managers and ETF sponsors - which has always been particularly fierce - is heating up once again. The biggest ETF providers like BlackRock and State Street already charge fractions of a penny on the dollar for some of the most popular ETFs (which enjoy AUMs in the hundreds of billions of dollars), so how much lower can the bar go?







Well, Bloomberg reported Friday that Atlanta-based Invesco is launching two new ETFs that will have all management fees waived for the rest of the year, further aggravating the industry&#x27;s price war. The f…</span>

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


A doctor who argued that the UK’s COVID-19 lockdown should remain in place indefinitely may have inadvertently revealed his true thoughts by letting slip the comment, “sadly, it can’t be forever.”







Yes, really.


The remark was made by National Health Action Party’s Doctor Richard Taylor during a fiery interview hosted by Julia Hartley-Brewer on TalkRADIO.


Hartley-Brewer challenged Taylor’s ‘zero COVID’ argument after the doctor suggested that some form of lockdown should remain in place until the virus is entirely eradicated, which is a scientific impossibility.

Authored by Mike Shedlock via MishTalk.com,


Let&#x27;s investigate the relationship between real interest rates and the price of gold.







Real means inflation adjusted. 


I calculated the real interest rate by subtracting year-over-year CPI from the current 3-month T-bill yield. 


One could also use the Fed Funds Rate or 1-month T-Bill rate as the yields are all about the same. 







The following chart puts the negative interest rate theory to the test,


Real Interest Rate vs Price of Gold 







The chart above shows the monthly gold close, not monthly highs. That explains why the 1980 top does not show.

                    <span>Thor Industries Now Has $14 Billion Order Backlog Amid Booming Demand For RVs 

            
About two months after we discussed recreational vehicles are &quot;on pace for a blowout year&quot; and &quot;sales just hit an all-time high,&quot; we got the latest confirmation from Thor Industries CEO Bob Martin. He spoke with Jim Cramer on &quot;Mad Money&quot; earlier this week about the manufacturer&#x27;s massive order backlog. 







Thor Industries — Airstream, Heartland RV, Jayco, Livin Lite RV, and others — first began to experience an uptick in sales after lockdowns ended in May and June 2020. Without a vaccine, people were too afraid to fly or stay in hotels or resorts, so they bought campers and traveled. The RV industry also saw a lot of first-time buyers, especially with the millennial generation.

The media has caught a not-so-curious case of amnesia when it comes to Attorney General Merrick Garland - who&#x27;s been royally pissing off Biden supporters after the DOJ has shown an increased tendency to side with the Trump administration in legal wranglings that were considered &#x27;bombshell&#x27; controversies under AG Barr.

                    <span>Visualizing The History Of US Inflation Over 100 Years

            
Is inflation rising?


The consumer price index (CPI), an index used as a proxy for inflation in consumer prices, offers some answers. In 2020, inflation dropped to 1.4%, the lowest rate since 2015. By comparison, inflation sits around 5.0% as of June 2021.







Given how the economic shock of COVID-19 depressed prices, rising price levels make sense. However, as Visual Capitalist&#x27;s Dorothy Neufeld notes, other variables, such as a growing money supply and rising raw materials costs, could factor into rising inflation.


To show current price levels in context, this Markets in a Minute chart from New York Life Investments shows the history of inflation over 100 years.

By John Sexton of HotAir


Last year there was a proposal circulating in the Seattle City Council to consider making drug abuse and mental disorders a defense against most misdemeanor crimes. In essence, that would have been a green light for an army of homeless shoplifters to steal at will knowing they’d face no chance of being punished. But it appears Seattle police have decided to do something about aggressive shoplifters. This Wednesday they arrested 53 shoplifters in 9 separate stores:



“These are organized groups that hit retailers with the sole purpose of stealing to either resell them or use them as currency for other things,” said Sgt. Randy Huserik, public information officer for the Seattle P…</span>

Drug cartels such as the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, or CJNG, have upgraded their arsenals with an elite special forces unit, according to atlas.news. 


CJNG released a video of their &quot;Grupo Elite&quot; otherwise known as special forces team, &quot;outfitted with signal jammers and heavily modified rifles,&quot; said atlas.news. The video also shows the unit in what appears to be a bulletproof vehicle. 


CJNG released the video (watch here) on the prospects of expanding their control into Naucalpan de Juárez, a city located just northwest of Mexico City in the neighboring State of Mexico. They appear to be threatening local drug lord Nestor Arturo Lopez Arellano, otherwise known as &quot;El 20.&quot;

This special report looks at the ‘hot topic’ of ‘hot’ inflation, and asks if it is really back to stay 

	

	

	
Inflation is crucial for financial markets, but we lack an accurate economic theory of what causes it, leading to inaccurate modelling and policy/forecasting errors

	

	

	
We draw a broader framework of the eight structural factors currently driving global inflation: a ‘bullwhip’ effect; the Fed; fiscal policy; speculators; psychology; Chinese demand; labour vs. capital; and the role of global supply chains/the distribution of production

Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,


Inflation is making headlines all over the country, but the mainstream media is not being honest about the true severity of the crisis.  We are being told that the official rate of inflation is still in single digits, but what we aren’t being told is that the way inflation is calculated has changed dramatically over the years.  In fact, according to Forbes “the government has changed the way it calculates inflation more than 20 times” over the past 30 years.  The rate of inflation directly affects so many other things in our system, and the government would like to keep that number as low as possible.  So they tinkered and tinkered with …</span>

                    <span>Ford&#x27;s Electric F-150 Lightning Reservations Pass 100,000

            
While Tesla&#x27;s Cybertruck was revealed far in advance of Ford&#x27;s F-150 Lightning electric pickup, the Lightning has several things going for it.


First, it actually appears to exist, and is planned to roll off the assembly line in Spring 2022 - unlike the Cybertruck, the current status of which is up in the air. Second, the Ford F-150 Lightning now has 100,000 reservations in just the 3 short weeks since its introduction. 


Emma Bergg, Ford spokeswoman, told the Detroit Free Press on Thursday: &quot;We&#x27;re super excited about the demand. Reservations are getting added all the time.&quot;


 





The Lightning was released 3 weeks ago and packs 563 horsepower and 775 lb.-ft. of torque. In the first 48 hours after its release, the company received 44,500 pre-orders. President Biden was at the truck&#x27;s release last month and even gave the Lightning a test drive and some free press. &quot;This sucker is quick,&quot; Biden said, after taking off in the truck on a closed course. 


By comparison, since 2019, Tesla&#x27;s Cybertruck has accumulated over 1 million reservations. 


Tesla&#x27;s official website doesn&#x27;t denote an expected delivery date. As of May, it was expected that the Cybertruck would begin production in &quot;late 2021&quot;. 


Ford, meanwhile, is taking $100 refundable deposits for the Lightning and the truck starts at $39,974.

Authored by Brett Wilkins via via CommonDreams.org,


Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has accused the US-backed international financial system of blocking the country&#x27;s access to Covid-19 vaccines under the COVAX program, even though Venezuela has paid all but $10 million of the $120 million it owes.


Appearing in a televised address, Rodríguez said Venezuela was unable to pay the remaining $10 million because it was being blocked from transferring funds to the Switzerland-based GAVI Vaccine Alliance, which directs COVAX. &quot;The financial system that also hides behind the U.S. lobby has the power to block resources that can be used to immunize the population of Ve…</span>

According to a new study, the rising prevalence of celiac disease in Europe is absolutely astonishing and has more than doubled over the last 25 years. 


Researchers at Marche Polytechnic University in Ancona, Italy, found that celiac disease, sometimes called celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause painful damage to small intestines over time, doubled in school children compared to a similar study by the same group 25 years ago.

Authored by James Rickards via DailyReckoning.com,


Boring. I never thought I would say that about gold prices, but the gold price action for the last nine months has been boring.


And that’s actually a good thing. Why?


After beginning with the boring part, I’ll explain. Let me unpack this…


Gold prices hit an all-time high of $2,069 per ounce on August 6, 2020.


The yield-to-maturity on the 10-year Treasury note hit an interim low of 0.508% on August 4, 2020. The near simultaneity of those two benchmarks is no coincidence.


The interest rate on the 10-year note has been practically the sole determinant of the dollar price of gold since that August convergence of low rates and high gold prices.


But that isn’…</span>

This weekend, the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) closed down multiple city streets around the Inner Harbor, in a stretch called &quot;Fells Point,&quot; after dozens of local businesses threatened the new city government, run by Mayor Brandon Scott, to not pay taxes because they&#x27;re &quot;fed up and frustrated&quot; with the outburst of violence. 


Last week, 37 restaurants and small businesses sent a letter to the mayor&#x27;s office titled &quot;Letter to City Leaders From Fells Point Business Leaders.&quot; They threatened to stop paying city taxes and other fees until &quot;basic and essential municipal services are restored.&quot; This comes as Madam State&#x27;s Attorney Marilyn Mosby halted petty crimes during the pandemic and made suc…</span>

GSA Capital Partners LLC and Citadel announced the settlement late last week after Citadel accused the fund of obtaining &quot;closely guarded&quot; trading strategies when it hired the employee in question, Vedat Cologlu, according to Bloomberg. 


GSA said of the settlement that the two firms “recognize and respect the importance and value of the other’s rights over their confidential information and intellectual property.”

                    <span>China Urges US &amp; Russia To Reduce Their Nuclear Arsenals

            
Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday called on the US and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals during the UN-backed Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.


While Washington is constantly hyping up China’s nuclear arsenal, it is only a fraction of what the US and Russia possess. Estimates on the higher-end put China’s nuclear stockpile at 350 warheads. Russia has about 6,350 warheads, while the US has 5,800.







Despite the numbers, the US complains that Beijing does not want to enter arms control talks. But China has no motivation to do so unless the US and Russia make an effort to reduce their arsenals. Regardless, the US continues to blame the issue on China.


&quot;To date, China has rebuffed US efforts to initiate bilateral talks on risk reduction and strategic stability,&quot; Robert Wood, the US ambassador for disarmament, said at the conference.


Besides having way more nuclear weapons than Beijing, the US is also encircling China with military hardware. The US has plans to deploy medium-range missiles near China that were previously banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the US withdrew from in 2019.







Wang took a shot at the US for its plans to further militarize Asia which he characterized as undermining regional stability.


&quot;China opposes the development and deployment of regional and global missile defense systems by a certain country that undermine strategic stability, and China opposes the deployment of land-based intermediate-range ballistic missiles by the same country in the neighborhood of other countries,&quot; he said.

Pakistan is expected to spend more than a billion dollars in the next fiscal year to import COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate around 100 million people. The trouble is, anti-vaccine groups have sprung up around the country and have deterred some from taking the vaccine. In response, one local government in Pakistan has a new weapon in its war chest against vaccine hesitancy: disable the SIM cards of mobile phones of people who decline to get jabbed, according to RT News. 


Punjab Health Minister Yasmin Rashid decided on Thursday during a meeting with the Punjab provincial government and military officials that anyone who denied the COVID-19 jab will have their SIM cards disabled at &quot;a certain time.&quot;

The Fed will be proven catastrophically wrong about inflation for the simple reason that inflation isn&#x27;t transitory, it&#x27;s sticky: when prices rise due to real-world scarcities and higher costs, they stay high and then move higher as expectations catch up with reality.


Consider the dynamic of Fed-inflated bubbles raising rents. The house that once sold for $200,000 is sold to a pool of investors for $800,000, and the property taxes, insurance and debt service rise accordingly: even though the house didn&#x27;t change, thanks to the Fed&#x27;s bubble, the entire cost structure is higher.

                    <span>Putin Reveals Personal Thoughts On Trump &amp; Biden In Rare NBC Interview

            
Russian President Vladimir Putin this week sat down for an interview with a US media outlet for the first time in nearly three years. NBC&#x27;s Keir Simmons talked to Putin for about 90 minutes, and released a teaser segment Friday night. 


Perhaps the most interesting part of the conversation centered on the Russian leader&#x27;s perspective on American politics and his personal thoughts and comparison of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Putin called the former president &quot;extraordinary&quot; and &quot;talented&quot; while noting that Biden is &quot;radically different&quot; and is a quintessential &quot;career man&quot; in politics.

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


A UK government adviser and former Communist Party member Susan Michie says that mask mandates and social distancing should continue “forever” and that people should adopt such behaviour just as they did with wearing seatbelts.







Michie, who is a Professor of Health Psychology at UCL and a leading member of SAGE, said such control measures should become part of people’s “normal” routine behaviour.


&quot;Vaccines are a really important part of pandemic control but it is only one part. [A] test, trace and isolate system, [as well as] border controls, are really essential. And the third thing is people’s behaviour. That is, the behaviour of social dist…</span>

As the real estate market continues to break records, a cabal of institutional investors has been tossing gasoline on the fire - buying up properties hand-over-fist as middle-American renters watch their dreams of home ownership fade at the hands of pension funds and other financial behemoths.


A bidding war broke out for the Amber Pines 124-unit rental-housing community built by D.R. Horton.

The Fed’s destructive money-pumping has many victims, but chief among these is the Wall Street financial narrative itself. 


It emits not a whiff about the patent absurdity of the Fed’s monthly purchase of $120 billion of treasury and GSE debt under current circumstances; and treats with complete respect and seriousness the juvenile word game known as “thinking about thinking about tapering” by which the clowns in the Eccles Building fearfully attempt to placate the liquidity-intoxicated speculators on Wall Street.


So it’s not surprising that today’s 5.0% CPI reading was made inoperative within minutes after the BLS release by a chorus …</span>

                    <span>One Shocking Chart That Has Farmers Trembling With Fear 

            
Readers know by now that the Western US is facing one of the most severe droughts in years. We&#x27;ve documented (read here &amp; here) this spring of a &quot;megadrought&quot; sweeping across states like California and Nevada as risks of a second Dust Bowl increase by the day. 


But in this note, let&#x27;s dive deeper into the drought and how it&#x27;s impacting farmers and the potential consequences it could have on crops. Meteorologists at BAMWX have published data on surface soil moisture over 20 years. Surface soil moisture is the water that is in the upper 4 inches and available for various types of plants. They found that the 2021 moisture deficit for early June is the worst it has ever been in two decades. 







BAMWX&#x27;s Vince Bryan says the moisture deficit in the soil is &quot;a concern&quot; as it may impact plant development. Soil moisture plays a crucial role in agricultural monitoring, drought and flood forecasting, forest fire prediction, and water supply management. 


Soil moisture observations can alert of impending drought, such as what&#x27;s been underway in the Western US this year. 


What this means is that soil moisture deficits can dry crops and make them more vulnerable to pests. Even short-term drought can cause damage to crops, mainly during critical stages of crop development, such as after planting or during flowering. 


If the drought persists, crop yields could come underestimates this year and result in elevated agricultural prices.

Authored by Mark Jeftovic via BombThrower.com,


Lately I have been thinking a lot about the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum while at the same time the world is witnessing the inexorable move to crypto in realtime. Some may question the latter half of that assertion, given that the latest FUD cycle against cryptos has been one of the most intense that I’ve witnessed since getting involved in the space in 2013.







Behind the FUD we see actions. We see Russia dumping dollar assets (can you blame them?).


We hear Munger making almost childishly uninformed remarks on crypto, yet BRK is investing in one of the world’s most crypto friendly banks.

Despite the activist shareholder battles, calls for ESG changes and just outright negative press about fossil fuels, it looks like rumors of oil&#x27;s death have been greatly exaggerated. Fossil fuels aren&#x27;t dying - rather, their output is just being shifted to national and state owned companies. 


Even as the supermajor oil companies shrink in size and adhere to incessant criticism, fossil-fuel demand holds strong, according to Yahoo Finance. Activists have been the busiest they have been in years...



Recent weeks saw Exxon and Chevron rebuked by their own shareholders over climate concerns, while Shell lost a lawsuit in the Hague over the pace of its shift away from oil and gas.

Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,


In my entire lifetime, this is the worst that drought conditions have ever been in the western half of the country.  During the past 20 years, the amount of territory in the West considered to be suffering from exceptional drought has never gone higher than 11 percent until now.  Today, that number is sitting at 27 percent.  The term “mega-drought” is being thrown around a lot these days to describe what is happening, but this isn’t just a drought.  This is a true national emergency, and it is really starting to affect our food supply.

There should be little doubt that the timing is intentional: China on Thursday passed its sweeping new law to &#x27;safeguard&#x27; Chinese businesses and entities from Western and especially US sanctions, just hours ahead of President Joe Biden sitting down with G-7 leaders in Cornwall to argue for a common stance on curtailing China&#x27;s influence. AFP observes: &quot;China&#x27;s quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left European and American companies shocked and facing &#x27;irreconcilable&#x27; compliance issues, two top business groups said Friday, despite Beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment.&quot;

So in case you haven’t been keeping up it’s been pretty thoroughly confirmed that the US government’s highly anticipated UFO report due this month won’t contain any significant revelations and certainly won’t verify anyone’s ideas about these phenomena being extraterrestrial in origin, but it absolutely will contain fearmongering that UFOs could be evidence that the US has fallen dangerously behind Russian and Chinese technological development in the cold war arms race.

On Wednesday, President Biden told US troops stationed in the UK that the Joint Chiefs told him &quot;the greatest threat facing America&quot; is &quot;global warming&quot; - a curious pivot from &quot;white supremacy.&quot;



Sooo.... White Supremacy was the biggest problem in America up until Hunter said the n-word.

Now we&#x27;re back to climate change... got it.

On day later, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs &#x27;corrected&#x27; Biden, asserting instead that the biggest threats facing the US are China and Russia, according to US News, (and who allegedly had a big role in scamming half of pandemic unemployment funds to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars…</span>

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Remember when networks and legal experts (correctly) denounced President Donald Trump for his attacks on judges who ruled against him?


Two years ago, I ran a column noting that Democrats were adopting the same attacks on conservative judges but the media was entirely silent.


Now,  California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democrats are lambasting a federal judge who ruled in favor of gun rights in a recent decision — accusing him of being in the pocket of the NRA and a danger to the country.  The response to Newsom’s attack from all of those same media and legal experts has ranged from outright support to conspicuous silence.

                    <span>Former ADT Tech Sentenced To Prison After Spying On Naked Women And Couples Having Sex

            
A former ADT security technician was sentenced to four years and four months in federal prison for repeatedly hacking into customers&#x27; video feeds in North Texas and spying on attractive women and couples engaging in sexual activity inside their homes, according to CBS Dallas.


Tesforo Aviles (via the Daily Mail)


Telesforo Aviles, 35, pleaded guilty to computer fraud in January - admitting to adding his personal email address to customers&#x27; &quot;ADT Pulse&quot; accounts, which gave him real-time access to video feeds from their homes. In some instances he claimed he needed to add himself temporarily to &quot;test&quot; the system, while in other cases he added himself without customer knowledge.


According to plea papers, Aviles watched numerous videos of naked women and couples engaging in sexual activity, which he admitted he would view for sexual gratification.


Aviles accessed roughly 200 customer accounts over 9,600 times without their consent.


&quot;This deliberate and calculated invasion of privacy is arguably more harmfrul than if I had installed no security system and my house had been burglarized,&quot; said one female victim in a statement to the court. &quot;This sick and corrupt individual&#x27;s actions will have a lasting emotional and mental toll on me.&quot;


&quot;This defendant, entrusted with safeguarding customers’ homes, instead intruded on their most intimate moments,&quot; Acting US Attorney Perak Shah said in January.


Aviles faced up to five years in prison.


Unfortunately for the victims, they couldn&#x27;t opt-out of Aviles&#x27; intrusions like Amazon Sidewalk customers. You never know who&#x27;s on the other end.

Via MoneyMetals.com,


As foreign governments reportedly accumulate gold and de-dollarize their sovereign wealth funds, a Republican congressman is asking tough questions of the U.S. Treasury about its secretive gold activities.


Representative Alex Mooney (R-WV) – sponsor of the Gold Reserve Transparency Act of 2021 (H.R. 3526) to require the first true audit of America’s gold in decades – wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen this week requesting detailed information about the U.S. gold holdings delegated to the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund and posed other questions.

On Thursday the state-run Central Bank of Cuba (BCC) announced that it&#x27;s suspending all deposits in US dollars due to what it called America&#x27;s &quot;economic blockade&quot; of the country&#x27;s banking system. 


&quot;Given the obstacles imposed by the US economic blockade for the Cuban banking system to depositing abroad cash in US dollars collected in the country, the decision has been made to temporarily stop the acceptance of bills in that currency by the Cuban banking and finance system,&quot; national media cited the bank as saying.







The decision will go into effect starting June 21, and for now it appears indefinite with no end date for the restrictive measures being issued.

Authored by Brad Polumbo via The Foundation for Economic Education,


With pandemic restrictions finally being wound down around the country, the economy should be roaring back to life. But we’ve seen much more muted job growth than expected, and we have a record-breaking 9.3 million unfilled job openings while millions of Americans languish on unemployment welfare. What’s going on?







Well, a new small business survey reveals two key problems plaguing our economy.


The National Federation of Independent Businesses regularly surveys the thousands of small businesses whose interests it represents. Released this week, its latest polling offers yet more proof that a labor shortage is rest…</span>

After a pretty impressive start on Mars that included NASA&#x27;s Perseverance rover deploying a small robotic, coaxial helicopter called Ingenuity, the rover is beginning a 3-mile road trip across the Red Planet to search for signs of life, according to NASA JPL.


Since Perseverance landed on Mars in February, it&#x27;s taken tens of thousands of images, and its microphones have picked up sounds from the planet. Ingenuity has seven successful flights under its belt, testing if its aeronautical design can survive the planet&#x27;s thin atmosphere.

I’m not much of a Led Zeppelin fan. In fact, I have an unnatural animus towards Led Zeppelin. Outside of Houses of the Holy and “Fool in the Rain” and “Misty Mountain Hop” I pretty much don’t have anything good to say about them.


That’s weird coming from someone of my demographic — Gen X, white suburban male who grew up on a steady diet of what’s today “Classic Rock” radio.


That said, I admit that part of this animus toward Zep is unfair because it comes from the insanity of my friends’ obsession with them to the exclusion of nearly all other types and kinds of music when we were teenagers getting our artistic imprint on.

                    <span>Watch: Arkansas State Trooper Flips Pregnant Woman&#x27;s SUV As She Looks For A Safe Place To Pull Over

            
An Arkansas State Police trooper is being sued after running out of patience while trying to initiate a traffic stop, and eventually flipping over a pregnant woman&#x27;s vehicle during a traffic stop on a major highway.


Dashcam video of the incident was released this week showing the driver, Nicole Harper, traveling down I-67 when Senior Cpl. Rodney Dunn tried to pull her over for speeding. Instead of pulling over, she continued down the highway, moving over to the right lane and slowing down with her hazard lights on.


While the woman claims she was looking for a safe place to pull over, the officer ran out of patience. In the video the Arkansas State Police trooper is seen using a PIT maneuver &quot;which caused Harper’s car to crash into the concrete median and flip,&quot; according to Fox 16. 





“In my head I was going to lose the baby,” Harper told Fox 16. The video shows the officer asking her: “Why didn’t you stop?” 


She responded: “Because I didn’t feel it was safe.”


The officer then says, &quot;well this is where you ended up.”


“I thought it would be safe to wait until the exit,” the driver pleads. The officer responds: “no ma’am, you pull over when law enforcement stops you.”﻿


Jalopnik noted that &quot;Dunn gave Harper all of two minutes before he nudged her car&quot; and that the driver was &quot;less than a mile from the nearest exit with a wide shoulder.&quot;


In the interim, Harper did just what the Arkansas State Police’s Driver License Study Guide says you are supposed to do when being pulled over. “What to do When You Are Stopped,” number one says to use, “emergency flashers to indicate to the officer that you are seeking a safe place to stop,” Fox 16 reported.


“I did slow down, I turned on my hazards, I thought I was doing the right thing,” Harper said.﻿

The Trump Justice Department in 2017 and early 2018 issued subpoenas to Apple to obtain the communications records of at least two Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Eric Swalwell (D-CA). According to The New York Times, DOJ prosecutors attempting to determine who leaked classified information to the media about Russiagate suspected the two House Democrats were the culprits, and to prove that, they obtained their communications records as well as those of family members, including minor children.

Today&#x27;s Consumer Inflation Cycle Comes With Yesteryear Denial, Problems &amp; Consequences


Consumer price inflation is experiencing its most significant increases in decades. Yet, reported inflation does not capture the full scale and breadth of experienced inflation. I never thought the US would experience rampant inflation again, but based on the 1970s price measurement methods, the US experienced double-digit inflation in the past twelve months.

In May, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.6%, pushing the twelve-month increase to 5%, the most significant increase since 2008. Core CPI rose 0.7%, …</span>

President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration is mulling over new measures to provide relief to U.S. oil refiners pressured from biofuel blending mandates. This has sent corn and soybean futures and soyoil futures lower on Friday. There were also new weather models forecasting crop-boosting rains in parts of the U.S. Midwest and Northern Plains, resulting in declines in grain prices. 



&quot;The biofuel news spooked the market, you&#x27;ve got some rains in the Dakotas ... and the palm oil was down 4% to 5% overnight. That is all weighing on it,&quot; Craig Turner, senior ag broker at Daniels Trading, told Reuters.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to delay the country&#x27;s &quot;freedom day&quot; from lockdowns by just under one month - from June 21 to July 19 - after the &#x27;Delta variant&#x27; COVID-19 strain from India exploded 240% in one week, as was first reported by The Sun, and later confirmed by the Financial Times via comments by England&#x27;s Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitley, who requested the delay.



Under plans drawn up to be announced on Monday, a two-week review will be included meaning Covid restrictions could be dropped on July 5 if hospitalisations stay down.


But multiple sources told the Sun the chances of lifting restrictions as planned on June 21 were close to zero - in a massive bl…</span>

Earlier this week, we joked about a Bloomberg story claiming a 30-year-old Credit Suisse credit-trading wunderkind was being cut adrift by the bank amid a bout of &quot;de-risking&quot; inspired by the twin blowups caused by Greensill and Archegos, which might cost the bank up to $10 billion.


When the trader, Moroccan-born Hamza Lemssouguer, was poached by Citadel (to join the company&#x27;s hedge fund division as a portfolio manager for a new credit fund), Credit Suisse managed to keep him from leaving with the promise that the firm would seed a new fund for him under its asset management division.

                    <span>&quot;We Are Building Up To A Big Accident&quot; - Gap Between 10Y Yields And CPI Is The Highest Since 1980

            
Even though US CPI smashed expectations again, Deustche Bank&#x27;s chief credit strategist Jim Reid correctly points out that &quot;the data isn’t going to change anyone’s mind of whether inflation is transitory or not.&quot;


Still, as an aside for those who still care about fundamentals, he notes that the current gap between 10yr US yields (c.1.5%) and US CPI (5.0%) is a whopping 3.5%, the highest since 1980. In fact, the gap has only been more negative for 10 months in the last 70 years, all of which were in 1974, 1975 or 1980.







Another way of visualizing the unprecedented divergence between core inflation and 10Y yields is the following scattergram from Longview economics:







While such a deeply negative (albeit crude) proxy for real yields (as opposed to the manipulated ones where the Fed is implicitly setting real rates with its purchases of TIPS) is great for financial conditions today, the DB credit strategist asks, rhetorically, if &quot;we are building up to a big accident with such a mismatch between inflation and bond yields?&quot;


And just as rhetorically, Reid concludes that despite this stunning observation, &quot;no-one is going to have a different opinion to what they had yesterday though&quot; (although If anyone&#x27;s mind has changed, Reid would love to hear from you).

                    <span>&quot;Shot Themselves In The Foot&quot; - AMC &#x27;Messiah&#x27; Mudrick Battered By Bad Options Bet

            
On June 1st, Mudrick Capital went from hero to zero in the eyes of Reddit&#x27;s Wall Street Bets rebels as the hedge fund scooped up $230 million in newly issued stock at an above market price ($27.12), prompting Redditors to herald the fund as the company&#x27;s savior and sparking a bullish move in the stock - now that the firm was (marginally) better capitalized.



In our view, this is not mindless dilution, but rather this is very smart raising of cash so that we can grow this company... to many of you on Twitter, to grow YOUR company. Watch out naysayers, $AMC is going to play on offense again. Here we come! {5 of 5}

                    <span>Another 60MM J&amp;J Doses Produced At Troubled Baltimore Plant Are Tainted, FDA Says

            
Readers may remember earlier this year when an accident at the Emergent Biosolutions lab in Baltimore led to millions of J&amp;J and AstraZeneca doses being ruined (after workers cross-contaminated them with ingredients from AstraZeneca jabs being produced in the same factory).


Since the incident, the FDA has been reviewing safety and production procedures at the facility. But despite the US government handing over control to J&amp;J, attempts to re-start production have been in limbo, and according to the NYT, another 60MM doses produced at the facility didn&#x27;t meet the agency&#x27;s safety standards.

The pace of GDP growth is likely to peak in Q2. That makes sense given the amount fiscal stimulus in the first few months.

	

	

	
But it is the pace of deceleration that matters more, and that remains an open question.

	

	

	
This is interest because the pace will affect inflation, yields, and the Fed.

	

	

	
At the moment, it looks “peakish” from GDP expectations to Fed hike timing to CPI forecasts.

The US continues to downplay expectations for the upcoming summit between President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin that is scheduled for June 16th in Geneva.


The meeting comes as US-Russia relations are at their lowest point since the Cold War. Despite the dangerous path the two largest nuclear powers are on, the Biden administration doesn’t seem interested in any diplomatic breakthroughs.

&quot;We’re not expecting to have a huge outcome from this,&quot; White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said of the summit in an interview with ABC. Psaki made it clear that Biden will take a confrontational approach to the meeting. &quot;He’…</span>

One day before the &quot;most important CPI print in history&quot;, we showed the latest JPM Treasury Client survey and pointed out that &quot;there were virtually no traders left to short Treasurys, with all bears already on board&quot; as net short interest had hit an all time high. As a result, even a red hot CPI had been fully priced in by now, and the result would be sharply lower yields as we got another massive short squeeze, this time in rates.







Well, with 10Y yields tumbling to March lows and breakevens in freefall over the past 48 hours, that&#x27;s precisely what happened, and since not even yesterday&#x27;s scorching inflation print managed to spark some bearish rate sentiment, the market was prom…</span>

Update (2000ET): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday that it will convene an &quot;emergency meeting&quot; of its advisers on June 18th to discuss rare but higher-than-expected reports of heart inflammation following doses of the mRNA-based Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.


The new details about myocarditis and pericarditis emerged first in presentations to a panel of independent advisers for the Food and Drug Administration, who are meeting Thursday to discuss how the regulator should approach emergency use authorization for using COVID-19 vaccines in younger children.

                    <span>Ford Secures 100,000 Reservations For Electric F-150 As Pre-Order Count Climbs 

            
While Tesla&#x27;s Cybertruck remains in limbo somewhere and Lordstown Motors is on the brink of failure, Ford Motor Company&#x27;s F-150 Lightning pre-order count continues to surge. 


Three weeks ago, Ford unveiled the F-150 Lightning, an all-electric truck, delivering 563 horsepower and 775 lb.-ft. of torque. In the first 48 hours of release, the company received 44,500 pre-orders, according to CEO Jim Farley. 







Now, the pre-order count has reached 100,000 and continues to climb, according to Engadget. The F-Series line is America&#x27;s best-selling truck for more than four decades. Millions of loyal Ford customers would never buy a Chevy, nevertheless, a Tesa or some other startup with a limited track record. 


By comparison, since 2019, Tesla&#x27;s Cybertruck has accumulated over 1 million Cybertruck reservations. Ford has a much larger following than Tesla and could surpass reservations. 


Besides Ford&#x27;s loyal customer base, spanning generations, President Sleepy Joe gave the car company free press last month when he was seen driving around in the vehicle on a closed course. 





&quot;This sucker is quick,&quot; Biden said at the press conference. 


Reservations require a $100 refundable deposit. Ford has said the F-150 Lightning deliveries should begin in the spring of 2022. The Cybertruck is expected to be released in late 2022 but really, who knows. 


Those who made reservations for the Ford electric truck will only have to wait about 10-12 months until delivery. Meanwhile, those who made Cybertruck reservations have been waiting for a couple of years.

                    <span>Buchanan: What Is America&#x27;s Cause In The World?

            
Authored by Pat Buchanan,


“Take away this pudding; it has no theme,” is a comment attributed to Winston Churchill, when a disappointing dessert was put in front of him.


Writers have used Churchill’s remark to describe a foreign policy that lacks coherence or centrality of purpose.


For most of our lifetimes, this has not been true of the United States. The goal of our foreign policy has been understandable and defined.


From 1949-1989, it was Cold War containment of the Soviet Empire and USSR.


Ronald Reagan believed in a “rollback” of communism, once telling an aide that his policy might be summed up as: “We win. They lose.”


At the Cold War’s end, George H. W. Bush said America would now lead mankind in t…</span>

                    <span>Pentagon Pushes Plans For Afghan Airstrike Capability Even After Troop Exit

            
A growing body of indicators point to Biden&#x27;s vaunted plan for a full Afghan troop exit by Sep.11 being anything but a true and full final &quot;exit&quot;. First, as we described earlier the Pentagon is thinking up ways to leave a significant security &quot;footprint&quot; which defense officials say is necessary to protect the sprawling embassy in Kabul. There&#x27;s also talk of &quot;counterterrorism support&quot; directed from outside the country, which is said to be one among a &quot;range of options&quot; to soon be presented to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


A South Korean designer has created a ‘third eye’ that allows people to constantly look at their cellphones in the street as a warning to “smartphone zombies.”







Paeng Min-wook’s ‘The Third Eye’ is basically a sophisticated robotic eyeball that users strap to their forehead which warns them if they are about to bump into something.


“Paeng’s invention uses a gyro sensor to measure the oblique angle of the user’s neck and an ultrasonic sensor to calculate the distance between the robotic eye and any obstacles. Both sensors are linked to an open-source single-board microcontroller, with battery pack,” reports Reuters.

Update (1900ET): The bipartisan group has agreed to pitch a $1.2 trillion eight-year infrastructure spending package to the Biden administration, according to Bloomberg, citing an anonymous source familiar with the deliberations.


The proposal is notably backed by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), and calls for $579 billion in net new spending &quot;beyond outlays that Congress was already expected to enact.&quot;

After talks between President Joe Biden and Sen. Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV) broke down earlier this week, a bipartisan group of 10 senators led by Mitt Romney (R-UT) say they&#x27;ve reached a tentative deal on the the size of an infrastructure deal, as well as how they&#x27;d pay for i…</span>

Much of the Western half of the US is in a severe drought, and parts of the Southwest are &quot;exceptionally dry,&quot; the worst category, according to US Drought Monitor. Taking this into account, the iconic Hoover Dam has just recorded the smallest amount of water inside Lake Mead since the 1930s. 







The damming of the Colorado River at the Nevada-Arizona border created Lake Mead and supplies water to 25 million people, including in the cities of Las Vegas, Phoenix, Tucson, Los Angeles, and San Diego.

Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,


The pace at which conditions are changing is catching a lot of people off guard.  Here in the United States, we have been in a low inflation environment for most of the past four decades, and so many Americans don’t even have a frame of reference for what a highly inflationary environment looks like.  But now we are facing an inflation crisis that is unlike anything that we have seen since the Jimmy Carter era in the 1970s.  In response to the COVID pandemic, governments around the world have been borrowing and spending colossal mountains of money, and global central banks have been absolutely flooding their respective financial systems with new cash…</span>

                    <span>&quot;A Dangerous Precedent&quot; - 3rd FDA Advisor Quits After Controversial Alzheimer&#x27;s Drug Approval

            
While the mainstream media focused on the hope-filled headlines that, for the first time since 2003, the FDA approved Biogen&#x27;s Aduhelm treatment for Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease; few, if any, were fully aware of the levels of controversy behind the scenes.







Aside from the scientific uncertainty over whether amyloid plaque treatments are an approach worth continuing...



Despite the dominance of the amyloid hypothesis over the past few decades, evidence that links reductions in plaque levels to improvements in cognition is “thin, at best”, says Jason Karlawish, a geriatrician and co-director of the Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


A research study published in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association describes “whiteness” as a parasitic pathology that has no cure.







Yes, really.


The article, which is entitled ‘On Having Whiteness’, was written by Dr. Donald Moss (who is white), a faculty member of both the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and the San Francisco Center for Psychoanalysis.


Moss asserts that white people have a “particular susceptibility” to the “parasitic” condition, which he says “renders its hosts’ appetites voracious, insatiable, and perverse” and leads them to “terrorize” non-whites.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said former President Donald Trump would have won the 2020 election if investigations into the origin of COVID-19 and whether it escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, were not politicized.



“If COVID-19 had come about due to a Chinese lab leak, the top question on voters’ minds in the 2020 election would have become who was going to stand up to China. Which candidate would hold the Chinese accountable for unleashing the COVID-19 plague on the world?” wrote Graham for Fox News on Thursday.








As a result, Graham argued, “Americans would have demanded a tougher line against the Chinese c…</span>

Less than a week ago, we reported that the US COVID-19 vaccination scheme had fallen dramatically in recent weeks, likely a factor of a drop in new cases combined with an easing of facemask requirements.


And as President Biden scrambles to hit his July 4 target to vaccinate more than 70% of adults, a goal that&#x27;s looking increasingly remote every day, the NYT reported Thursday morning that there&#x27;s one region of the country that&#x27;s seeing vaccination demand fall more sharply than the others: And that&#x27;s the deep south. It shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise. But what&#x27;s even more surprising according to the NYT&#x27;s latest reporting, is that public health departments across the region have tried eve…</span>

Journalist Jeffrey Toobin, who was suspended by CNN and fired from The New Yorker after he was caught masturbating on a zoom call last October in full view of colleagues, has been allowed back into the fold at the failing cable news network following a six-month period of &#x27;reflection and growth.&#x27;







Hilariously, he had to sit there as CNN host Alisyn Camerota rang the shame bell behind him - then explain his side of it.


&quot;...you were caught masturbating, on camera. You were subsequently fired from that job after 27 years of working [at the New Yorker], and you since then have been on leave from CNN,&quot; said Camerota, adding &quot;What the hell were you thinking?&quot;


Toobin acknowledged that he had been &quot;deeply moronic,&quot; and his actions were &quot;indefensible,&quot; adding that he&#x27;s spent the last seven &quot;miserable months&quot; trying to be a better person, &quot;in therapy, trying to do some public service, working at a food bank, working on a new book...&quot;


Good to know what it takes to compel Toobin to engage in charitable acts. We can only hope he washed his hands before dealing with people&#x27;s food.

As much as half of the unemployment benefits paid by the US government over the past year may have been stolen through fraud, with the bulk ultimately ending up outside the country - likely into the hands of foreign crime syndicates in China, Nigeria, Russia and elsewhere, according to Axios&#x27; Felix Salmon.


According to some estimates, unemployment fraud during the pandemic could &#x27;easily reach $400 billion,&#x27; as states weren&#x27;t prepared for the unprecedented wave of unemployment claims

States knew that fraud was inevitable, but opted to rush money out to people with minimal oversight, as opposed to laboriously vetting each application.

                    <span>Melvin Capital Among Hedge Funds Losing $6 Billion On Latest Meme Squeeze

            
&quot;Fool me once, shame on... shame on you. Fool me... you can&#x27;t get fooled again,&quot; were the infamous words of former President Bush and we suspect that Steve Cohen protégé Gabe Plotkin is reflecting on those stoic words as he looks back at his fund&#x27;s performance in May.


Plotkin&#x27;s Melvin Capital - infamously blown-up by a retail rampage during January&#x27;s WSB Raid on heavily-shorted stocks - was joined by another fund, Light Street Capital, run by Glen Kacher (a Tiger Cub) in suffering significant losses as the sense of deja vu all over again in markets sent the most-heavily-shorted &#x27;Meme stocks&#x27; soaring to even higher highs once again in May.







As The FT reports, hedge fund losses just from betting against five popular meme stocks - GameStop, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, AMC, BlackBerry and Clover Health - total about $6bn since the start of May, according to the data firm Ortex Analytics.


It appears the bailout of Melvin Capital (which after sustaining a $4.5bn loss in January got $2.75bn in new cash from Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Ken Griffin’s Citadel) was used to maintain his big shorts... and suffer a Sisyphean loss on his shorts once again.


Perhaps more notably, Peter Hillerberg, Ortex’s co-founder, said funds had recently reduced their short positions in meme stocks but that short interest remained “at very high levels”.


The FT reports that Melvin is now down 44.7% YTD (against the S&amp;P&#x27;s +12%) with $11 billion AUM; and Light Street is down 20.1% YTD with $3.3 billion AUM.


Both firms declined to comment...

Another quarter, another record high in (mostly 0.01%er) household net worth.


The Fed&#x27;s latest Flow of Funds report released at noon today showed the latest snapshot of the US &quot;household&quot; sector as of March 31 2021, which confirmed that one year after the biggest drop in household net worth on record when $8 trillion was wiped out in Q1, 2020, in the 1st quarter of 2021, the net worth of US households soared by $5 trillion, or 3.8%, to a record $136.9 trillion. 







This means that over the past 12 months, US household net worth has increased by:



Q2 2020: $8.27TN

	
Q3 2020: $4.23TN

Banks are so overloaded with cash they are losing money on deposits...







No More Cash Please 


Some banks, awash in deposits, are encouraging corporate clients to spend the cash on their businesses or move it elsewhere. It&#x27;s a strange case of &quot;No More Cash Please&quot;.



U.S. companies are holding on to billions of dollars in cash. Their banks aren’t sure what to do with it. Some banks are encouraging corporate customers to consider alternatives. 


Top of mind for many big banks is a rule requiring them to hold capital equivalent to at least 3% of all assets. Worried about the rule’s impact during the pandemic, the Fed changed the calculation i…</span>

Drug kingpin Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman&#x27;s wife has pleaded guilty for her role in helping her husband run his multi-billion dollar empire in a Washington federal court on Thursday. 


32-year-old Emma Coronel Aispuro married El Chapo in 2007 and since then is believed to have &quot;aided and abetted&quot; the Sinaloa cartel in importing over 500,000 kilograms of drugs into the United States - mostly cocaine, but also heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana. For example the Mexico-based drug operation is believed responsible for up to 80% of all cocaine and heroin sold in Chicago in recent years. She further pled guilty to money laundering and charges related to El Chapo&#x27;s famous 2015 tunnel escape from a to…</span>

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Senator Rand Paul blasted Dr Fauci Wednesday, labelling him “an elitist” who believes Americans are not smart enough to make their own decisions about their health.







Appearing on Newsmax, Paul noted “I think it’s this — it’s one-size-fits-all and his idea that the regular people aren’t smart enough to make these regular decisions. So he just wants to treat everybody the same.”



“The one-size-fits-all strategy that everybody must get vaccinated ignores the science,” the Senator continued, adding “It’s mostly that he’s not telling the truth once again because he is an elitist, and he thinks we can’t handle the truth.”

                    <span>Next Week&#x27;s Heat Wave To Bake Californians 

            
June is typically the month the wildfire season in California begins. The state is already battling an extreme drought, and the first heat wave of the season hit last week. The risks of another heat wave are increasing for next week. 


The hottest and most fire-prone months are nearing as a second heat wave of the season could arrive as early as next week. 


How the season turns out may depend on the immediate climate in the state. Extreme heat and drought are several factors that may produce dry fuels and eventually spark fires. 


Forecast temperature anomalies daily are expected to jump for the southern part of the state by Tuesday/Wednesday and then the whole state by Friday. In many parts of the state, temperature anomalies, the difference from an average, or baseline, temperature, could be +14 degrees. Forecasts suggest Bakersfield and Fresno could reach triple digits. 







Prospects of the next heat wave come as the Drought Monitor (dated June 3) shows much of California, nevertheless, the West Coast, is experiencing some level of drought. 







California could be headed for a dangerous wildfire season with conditions already parched. 


Further, we want to monitor power prices in the state as grid demand could overwhelm supply, and power companies could issue rolling blackouts to conserve power or prevent wildfires.

By Eric Kulisch of Freight Waves,


Ground service providers drowning in shipments delivered by airlines are responding to massive gridlock at Chicago O’Hare by permanently relocating some warehouse operations outside the property  to increase capacity in what could increasingly become a model at major U.S. airports that haven’t prioritized investment in cargo facilities.







Alliance Ground International (AGI), with stations around the country, and local ground handling agent Maestro International Cargo this month are both opening large, off-airport transfer facilities to enable faster pickup of import cargo, which currently can take up to six days to retrieve after an aircraft’s arrival.

People on holiday are getting crabby in southern Deleware, right down the street from President Joe Biden&#x27;s vacation home, where a crab shortage has hit many popular restaurants. 


Crab processing plants on the Delmarva Peninsula to Gulf Coast states operate at a fraction of the output due to labor shortages. Crabs coming from Indonesia, the Philippines, and or India have seen shipment delays due to West Coast port congestion.

                    <span>How Will Investors Know If Inflation Is Transitory Or Permanent

            
By Steven Englander and John Davies, FX and Rates strategists at Standard Chartered Bank


The Fed has indicated that it does not see its expected inflation surge in the coming months as pointing to longer-term pressures. Many investors are sceptical, but do not have a framework from which to push back against the Fed’s optimism that it can manage a &quot;gentle inflation overshoot.&quot;


Here we argue that looking at trimmed mean inflation is a straightforward way of assessing whether an inflation surge is broad-based or narrow. So far, we find small indications that these broad-based inflation indicators are rising, but nothing conclusive. This assessment could change in the coming months.

With Wall Street firms tripping hand over foot to get out of New York, where taxes and crime are both on the rise, places like Palm Beach, Florida, are the beneficiaries. We have noted numerous firms, including names like Point 72 and Goldman Sachs, branching out and/or leaving New York altogether in favor of greener pastures in Florida, since the pandemic started.


Amidst the Wall Street exodus, Palm Beach office space demand is off the charges. The city has officially become a &quot;hot market&quot; for commercial real estate, according to a new report from BNN Bloomberg. As a result of the boom, Manhattan developer Related Cos. &quot;has been accelerating investments in West Palm B…</span>

Dr. Fauci attempts to defend himself on MSNBC. And MSNBC is seemingly pleased to cooperate to spread even more Fauci lies.







I picked up this story from a Greenwald Tweet. 



Beyond the dangerous arrogance and pomposity of proclaiming &quot;anyone who criticizes me is attacking Science&quot; -- thus placing himself off-limits from questioning -- he *admitted* he purposely issued false, anti-science, politicized claims, such as telling people not to wear masks: https://t.co/TghpTiKHdj

In a recent blog post from DB&#x27;s Francis Yared, the credit strategist looks at one of the lesser discussed drivers of inflation and points out that supply shocks to oil prices have historically been relevant for inflation expectations.


As Yared writes, &quot;supply shock to oil prices have had a significant impact on inflation expectations on three occasions over the past half century: in the mid 70s, the mid 80s and the mid 10s.&quot; However, unlike the infamous price explosions of the 70s and 80s, in the latest episode the &quot;shale oil revolution&quot; resulted in a significant positive supply shock to oil markets which led OPEC in 2014 to defend its market share rather than oil prices. The downward pressure on oil prices, Yared wri…</span>

Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


In the latest show of US support for Taiwan, a group of US senators flew to the island on a military aircraft on Sunday, a trip that drew sharp condemnation from Beijing.


Senators Dan Sullivan (D-AK), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Chris Coons (D-DE) arrived in Taiwan aboard a C-17 Globemaster III cargo plane to announce the US was donating 750,000 Covid-19 vaccines to the island. According to Reuters, US officials typically visit Taiwan in unmarked private jets.

It comes as no surprise to readers that dozens of Baltimore City businesses, located in the Inner Harbor, in a stretch called &quot;Fells Point,&quot; are threatening the new city government, run by Mayor Brandon Scott, with not paying their taxes because they&#x27;re &quot;fed up and frustrated&quot; with the outburst of violence.

Authored by Kalev Leetaru via RealClearPolitics.com,


Who is receiving more attention on television news since the inauguration, President Joe Biden or former president Donald Trump?


The graph below shows the total mentions of President Biden across CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and BBC News London since Biden&#x27;s inauguration day. Fox News has mentioned him the most, though even BBC News London has mentioned him nearly a third as often as CNN and MSNBC.







In contrast, the graph below shows that Fox News has covered former president Donald Trump far less than CNN or MSNBC. Look closely and you will notice that CNN and MSNBC have actually mentioned Trump more than Biden.







The graph below compares the two presidents since Biden&#x27;s inauguration, comparing mentions of Biden (blue) against Trump (orange).







On MSNBC, former president Trump has received 129% of the coverage of President Biden, followed closely by CNN&#x27;s 118%. On BBC News London, Trump has received 83% of Biden&#x27;s mentions, while on Fox News Trump has received just 55% as much coverage as Biden.

After the US Senate on Tuesday passed a historic bill to commit some $250 billion to fund scientific research as well as subsidies for chipmakers and robot developers, including an overhaul of the National Science Foundation - the largest effort to date in efforts to boost a US competitive edge over China as a tech powerhouse - Beijing has reacted by mocking Washington&#x27;s &quot;paranoid delusion&quot; and &quot;Cold War mentality&quot;. It&#x27;s also calling for an &quot;immediate&quot; halt to the legislation&#x27;s progress as it goes to the House.

Several election workers in Fulton County, Georgia are scheduled to be deposed in the coming days in a lawsuit that alleges thousands of fraudulent ballots were scanned in Atlanta on Election Night in 2020.

The Pentagon is touting that it&#x27;s already successfully withdrawn more than half of American forces from Afghanistan, which means it&#x27;s on a withdraw pace significantly ahead of Biden&#x27;s Sept. 11 exit deadline.


&quot;U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) estimates that we have completed greater than 50% of the entire retrograde process,&quot; the command announced Tuesday. And in terms of the massive logistical feat of removing military hardware after a two-decade occupation and build-up of bases, the military statement added that it&#x27;s removed the equivalent of approximately 500 C-17 planeloads of material while also removing 13,000 pieces of equipment.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


For over a year, there has been one fact that has been repeated in literally thousands of news stories: former Attorney General Bill Barr ordered the clearing of Lafayette Park on June 1, 2020 to allow former President Donald Trump to hold his controversial photo op in front of St. John’s Church. 


From the outset, there was ample reason to question the claim echoed across media outlets. As I noted in my testimony to Congress on the protest that month, the operation was clearly a response to days of violent and destructive protests.

                    <span>SEC&#x27;s Gensler Pushes For Executive Trading Plan Changes Aimed At Preventing Insider Trading

            
Company executives and insiders could be playing by a new set of 10b5-1 plan rules soon.


That&#x27;s because the Securities and Exchange Commission, headed up by Gary Gensler, has signaled that it plans on seeking to revise the rules that govern the stock trading plans, which are usually set up ahead of time to allow insiders to sell stock on a schedule. 


The plans have drawn scrutiny because there is no required disclosure when they are set up, despite many companies choosing to disclose the plans, and because they can be modified or canceled. They have also come under scrutiny after analysis from Stanford and U Penn found the plans were used for “opportunistic, large-scale selli…</span>

Authored by Rusty Weiss via ThePoliticalInsider.com,


The Daily Mail has revealed shocking text messages from Hunter Biden showing him using racial slurs and repeatedly using the n-word with his white lawyer in conversations.







The news comes just days after his father, President Joe Biden, gave an emotional speech on the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, in which he condemned racism.


Corporate attorney George Mesires, who is white, is allegedly referred to in the text messages multiple times as being black or referenced as a variation of the n-word.


Hunter Biden’s text messages were, based on reporting by the Daily Mail, discovered on the 51-year-old’s …</span>

President Biden previewed in a Washington Post op-ed that his eight day trip for which he embarked Wednesday, &quot;Will the democratic alliances and institutions that shaped so much of the last century prove their capacity against modern-day threats and adversaries? I believe the answer is yes. And this week in Europe, we have the chance to prove it.&quot;


And White House press secretary Jen Psaki Tuesday described somewhat dramatically how he&#x27;s been preparing for what&#x27;s the first foreign trip of his presidency: &quot;He&#x27;s been getting ready for 50 years. He has been on the world stage. He&#x27;s known a number of these leaders for decades, including President Putin, and including a number…</span>

Authored by Daniel Horowitz via TheBlaze.com,


We all knew this was coming. 







In order to justify the forced vaccination of children, the powers that be would somehow have to overturn 15 months of observations that COVID is less a threat to children than the flu and that unvaccinated children are less at risk than vaccinated adults (100 times less at risk than seniors), even if we are to believe Pfizer&#x27;s efficacy data.


&quot;CDC director reports spike in teen hospitalizations, urges parents to vaccinate kids over 12,&quot; was the headline at the Hill on Friday, reporting on the CDC&#x27;s new study of hospitalizations.


Naturally, it caught my attention because we a…</span>

Surely at this point, we have to be imagining things, right? 


We have reported twice on Tesla uber-bull and well known talking head-of-hair &quot;investment advisor&quot; Ross Gerber&#x27;s propensity for taking out government loans despite boasting on Twitter of how rich he was and how well his advisory firm was doing.


Back in July of 2020, we first pointed out that Gerber&#x27;s firm, Santa Monica-based Gerber Kawasaki, was among the many firms nationwide to take PPP money. His firm took out a total of $515,458 in PPP funds via Wells Fargo.







The irony, of course, came from the fact that on April 27, 2020, just 6 short days before his firm&#x27;s loan was approved, Gerber virtue signaled to the #resista…</span>

Update (1426ET): El Salvador has become the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender after Congress passed President Nayib Bukele&#x27;s proposal to embrace cryptocurrency. With bitcoin legal tender, just as the dollar, the country has set its sights on attracting miners. 


After all the clamoring about &quot;greening&quot; bitcoin mining, Bukele has offered miners &quot;cheap 100% clean, 100% renewable, 0 emissions&quot; energy. In fact, the president said the state-owned geothermal electric company LaGeo SA de CV will offer miners geothermal electricity powered from &quot;our volcanos.&quot;

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


We&#x27;re getting a real-world economics lesson in rip-your-face-off increases in prices, and the tuition is about to go up--way up.







Inflation will be transitory, blah-blah-blah--I beg to differ, for these reasons. There are numerous structural sources of inflation, which I define as prices rise while the quality and quantity of goods and services remain the same or diminish. Since the word inflation is so loaded, let&#x27;s use the more neutral (and more accurate) term decline in purchasing power: an hour of your labor buys fewer goods and services of lesser quality than it did a decade ago or a generation ago.

Leslie Wexner, former founder and CEO of L Brands and well known former pal of Jeffrey Epstein, has offloaded about $500 million worth of stock this year. In a filing posted Monday, Wexner revealed he sold $327 million in shares of L Brands, the parent company of Victoria&#x27;s Secret, bringing his total for the year up to about $500 million.


The sales come after Wexner revealed that he and his wife would be stepping down from the company&#x27;s board, according to Bloomberg.


The company&#x27;s stock is up about 600% since hitting a 5 year low in March 2020. Though Wexner had sold stock in the past to the tune of between $100 million and $200 million annually, his sales accele…</span>

Nearly 8 years have passed since Michael Lewis published &quot;Flash Boys&quot;, raising awareness of the relatively new practice of high-frequency trading and its transformative impact on markets, allowing the most technologically-advanced traders to effectively see a picture of the market that&#x27;s nanoseconds ahead of what their non-NFT peers see, giving them a massive advantage. 


Now, the SEC is finally considering changing the rules of how stocks are priced and traded to stop exchanges from incentivizing brokers (nowadays, particularly retail trading brokerages that have seen an explosion of activity in the past couple of years).

Beijing is poised to take an unprecedented step in its latest efforts to combat US and Western sanctions which have recently been ratcheted up particularly surrounding the Uyghur issue in Xinjiang. A draft law is now being examined by the National People&#x27;s Congress (NCP) which would shield Chinese entities and institutions from &quot;the unilateral and discriminatory measures imposed by foreign countries&quot; and ultimately the &quot;long arm jurisdiction&quot; of the United States, according to state media.

Authored by Maryellen Fullerton via SCOTUSblog.com,


The Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Monday that noncitizens who have been granted temporary humanitarian relief from deportation cannot use the process known as “adjustment of status” to obtain lawful permanent residency in the United States without leaving the country. 







The court ruled in Sanchez v. Mayorkas that adjustment of status is reserved for those who were inspected at the border and admitted to the United States by an immigration officer, thus disqualifying the majority of those granted Temporary Protected Status.


Justice Elena Kagan wrote the opinion for the court.

                    <span>Northeast Power Prices Jump As Heat Wave Forces Millions To Crank Up Air-Conditioning 

            
With the latest heat wave subsiding in the northeastern U.S., after several days of dangerously high temperatures above 90 degrees, power prices skyrocketed as tens of millions turned down their thermostats. 


According to Bloomberg, electricity prices in New England tripled on Monday from a year ago. Since the weekend, a heat wave blanketed the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast but will subside by midweek. 


Gary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy, said energy demands are way &quot;above normal&quot; for this time of year because of increasing air-conditioning use. New England&#x27;s grid operator could reach its summer peak in June instead of August, typically the hottest part of summer.


Monday&#x27;s highs were 90-95 degrees in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area to New York City to Boston. 


Grid operator PJM Interconnection LLC, a regional transmission organization serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, issued a hot weather alert Monday. PJM requested owners of transmission lines and power plants to delay maintenance. 


On-peak electricity prices for Bloomingdale, Massachusetts, energy prices per megawatt-hour spiked on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. 







Peak energy prices for New York City also spiked. 







The heat wave is expected to dissipate by mid-week as Mid-Atlantic and Northeast temperatures will be around average or slightly below normal as a cold front rolls in through the weekend.

By Jeffrey Jones of Gallup


Seventy-six percent of U.S. adults say they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or plan to be, a number that has been stable over the past three months but is higher than in late 2020 and early 2021.







As of the May 18-23 survey, 60% of U.S. adults report they have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 4% have been partially vaccinated, 12% plan to be vaccinated and 24% do not plan to be vaccinated.


Among those not planning to be vaccinated, 78% say they are unlikely to reconsider their plans, including 51% who say they are &quot;not likely at all&quot; to change their mind and get vaccinated. That leaves one in five vaccine-reluctant adults open to recons…</span>

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite attached to NASA-NOAA Suomi NPP satellite spotted what appears to be a dust storm blowing off the Sahara Desert and into the waters of the Atlantic Basin, where it could eventually end up in the Americas. 







NASA-NOAA Suomi NPP satellite took the image on June 4. A more recent update shows the dust is well over the central Atlantic Ocean by Tuesday.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


We recently discussed the case of Loudoun County teacher Byron “Tanner” Cross who was suspended for speaking against gender policies. In a major victory for the free speech rights of teachers, Twelfth Circuit Judge James E. Plowman ordered LCPS to restore Cross’ position as a physical education teacher at Leesburg Elementary School. In a letter, the court found a basis for a temporary injunction to allow Cross to return until Dec. 31 pending further orders of the court.







Cross ran into trouble when he appeared at a meeting of the school board.


He began by stating “My name is Tanner Cross and I am speaking out of love for th…</span>

In a continuing trend in Latin American politics of Left-wing political movements on the ascendancy which has seen successful attempts to roll back free market friendly policies in favor of &quot;starting from scratch&quot; toward erecting more interventionist socialist states, the next political and electoral earthquake is set to hit Peru, where socialist candidate Pedro Castillo is maintaining a narrow lead over right-wing rival Keiko Fujimori as votes are still being counted and increasingly contested from Sunday&#x27;s run-off election.


As of early Tuesday it&#x27;s still being deemed &quot;too close to call&quot;, but with Castillo pulling away Fujimori is now alleging election &quot;irregularitie…</span>

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has signaled opposition to several Democrat-proposed voting bills and ending the filibuster, said he won’t budge on a sweeping bill to overhaul federal elections after he met with civil rights groups.


“There was nothing basically for or against … basically everyone’s position was discussed,” Manchin told reporters on Tuesday after meeting with NAACP President Derrick Johnson, Al Sharpton, National Urban League president Marc Morial, and others.


When asked about whether he would support the “For the People Act” bill, the Democrat senator said, “No, I don’t think anybody change…</span>

                    <span>The Colonial Pipeline Hack, The &#x27;Russians&#x27;, &amp; The FBI&#x27;s Ransom-Grab - What Really Happened?

            
Speculation has been running rampant over today&#x27;s FBI press conference revealing the recovery of most of the ransom paid to &quot;Russian&quot; hackers by Colonial Pipeline.


Ben THE Kaufman summarizes:



Media: &quot;The FBI hacked Bitcoin and can take anyone&#x27;s funds.&quot;


Reality: The pipeline hackers didn&#x27;t have the Bitcoin in the first place but kept it in a remote server the FBI could access with subpoena.


Media coverage is mostly lies at this point.



Which raises the following point (h/t Jordan Schachtel):



So the &quot;hackers&quot; brought down the largest pipeline on the east coast...


...but couldn&#x27;t spend 50 bucks on a clean hardware wallet to secure their bitcoin?

Things aren&#x27;t going so well for Vice President Kamala Harris during her Guatemala trip, where as we observed earlier she went full Trump mode in a speech before Guatemalan press: &quot;...I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States Mexico border: Do not come, do not come,&quot; she said.


Simultaneously NBC News published a sit-down interview between Harris and news anchor Lester Holt which took place during the trip. He pressed her on why she hadn&#x27;t visited the border and that&#x27;s where things quickly got testy...

Talks between President Joe Biden and Sen. Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV) - lead GOP negotiator on infrastructure legislation - have ended with no resolution, according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Josh Wingrove. The negotiations, held via teleconference between the White House and a small group of Republican senators, were weighed down by deep disagreements over what actually constitutes &#x27;infrastructure,&#x27; with Republicans using the dictionary definition of roads and other public works, and Democrats expanding it to include just about anything they want it to mean.

The story about Wuhan’s “wet market” is taking on water. 







We’ve moved well past the “trust but verify” stage. We’re now in the “don’t trust a damn thing they say” stage.


In this case, “they” refers mostly to the Chinese Communist Party.


But the public’s mistrust has spread to our own government’s public health experts, and to much of the Western media, as well.


We still don’t know where the COVID-19 pandemic originated, but the more we learn, the less China’s official story sounds right. The World Health Organization’s year-long endorsement of Beijing means nothing. At this point, even the WHO is starting to say we need a more thorough inves…</span>

Oil prices spiked today with WTI back above $70 for the first time since Oct 2018 as traders edged down their odds of a completed Iran nuclear deal (which would likely bring new supply). US told Iran on Tuesday that it must let the UN atomic agency continue to monitor its activities, as laid out in an agreement that has been extended until June 24, or put wider talks on reviving the Iran nuclear deal at risk...

                    <span>&quot;Clampdown&quot;: Watch Gundlach&#x27;s Latest Webcast Live

            
It&#x27;s that time of the month when Bond King Jeff Gundlach regales his subjects, and investors in his DoubleLine, with his latest monthly thoughts revealed in the periodic webcast for this Total Return Fund.


Since it&#x27;s been about three months since Gundlach&#x27;s March 9 webcast when he laid out his outlook for the year, here is a recap of what he said then courtesy of Bloomberg:



Gundlach reiterated his bearish dollar call in the short-term, saying the greenback will be correlated to the budget. The Bloomberg Dollar Index has since declined 2.4% since he said that.

	
He called the Nasdaq “dicey,” making a daring call that it could eventually drop as much as it did from 2000 to 2003 (after the dot-com bubble deflated.) H…</span>

                    <span>State Department Lifts Travel Restrictions For Dozens Of Countries

            
Just as Ontario finally lifted some of its COVID-19-inspired travel restrictions, the US Department of State announced plans to revise its travel advisory for dozens of countries, including its neighbors, Canada and Mexico. While the border between American and Canada may remain closed until September, the State Department&#x27;s decision to lower its travel advisory to a Level 3 from a Level 4 could have major implications for tourism around the world.


Back in April, the US rated about 150 countries out of 209 as &quot;Level 4: Do Not Travel.&quot; Today that number has fallen to about 125 at the highest advisory level.


As restrictions start to ease, air travel, a popular gauge of travel linked to tourism, has sta…</span>

Twitter handle &quot;Insider Paper&quot; reports a massive fire has erupted at a polysilicon plant in China. 







According to the report, &quot;an explosion&quot; occurred at a polysilicon plant in Shihezi City, Xinjiang, China. Polysilicon, or poly-Si, is used as a raw material by the solar photovoltaic and electronics industries.

This report is so far unconfirmed by major western media outlets and is developing... But if confirmed, this could have severe implications for the global semiconductor industry, which is already in a terrible shortage.

As excerpted from &quot;Inflation: The defining macro story of this decade&quot; a must-read report written by Deutsche Bank&#x27;s global head of research, David Folkerts-Landau, co-authored by Peter Hooper and Jim Reid.



Ronald Reagan (1978): “Inflation is as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man.”


Joe Biden (2021): “A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything will be okay. Too many people today can’t do that – and it’s got to change.”

Iran nuclear talks in Vienna continue dragging on and despite recent weeks of positive developments and optimistic statements of being on the cusp of a restored deal, things are more tense than ever heading into a sixth round of talks set to begin on Thursday.


This is after a briefing issued by the UN&#x27;s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) early this week which alleged Iran is failing to cooperate with the nuclear watchdog after it found nuclear particles at multiple undeclared sites, possibly suggesting a more expanded program than previously believed.

Authored by Nick Corbishley via NakedCapitalism.com,


After India finally gets somewhat of a grip on its deadly second wave, one of its health regulators just took away one of its main lines of defense. 







India’s Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) has executed a policy reversal that could have massive implications for the battle against covid-19, not only in India but around the world. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives, are at providing stake. Providing no explanation whatsoever, the DGHS has overhauled its COVID-19 treatment guidelines and removed almost all of the repurposed medicines it had previously recommended for treating asymptomatic and mild…</span>

In case we needed more proof that the US labor market is in a historic supply-demand mismatch crisis sparked by Biden&#x27;s generous unemployment benefits, a few hours after the latest NFIB showed that it has never been more difficult for small business to fill job openings, moments ago the BLS confirmed what we expected: that the number of job openings in March (recall JOLTS is one month delayed) soared by a record 998K to 9.286MM in April from an upward revised 8.288MM in march, and the highest in the history of US jobs data!







The record number was also a record beat to the already lofty expectations of a 8.2 million print.

Throughout 2020, investors left the commodity sector discarded at the trash heap of the market, focusing instead entirely on growth and deflation names. Fast forward to today and boy have things changed: not only have growth names done little to nothing in 2021, a year which has seen near record shorting of tech names and a constant outflow of equity funds...







... but as sentiment shifts toward &quot;value&quot;, commodity-linked stocks have been rising every day, and even such boring names as Exxon and Chevron have recently turned into hedge fund darlings, attracting a bevy of activist shareholders and pushing higher by the day.

Authored by Bruce Wilds via Advancing Time blog,


Damn near every economist and analyst seem oblivious to the point being made in this article. The Fed should be ecstatic so many people are willing to invest in intangible assets. By not buying  tangible and real items they help to minimize inflation. In our bullshit world where media outlets like Bloomberg tout the message if you are not in this rising market, you are missing out, it is understandable that people want in. With this in mind, it is no wonder the investment world has become a minefield that is often compared to a casino.

Authored by Matthew Vadum via The Epoch Times,


Alabama and Georgia real estate agents have asked the Supreme Court to block a federal moratorium on evictions that was imposed last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid the pandemic.







Congress enacted a nationwide moratorium on evictions and extended its life through Jan. 31, 2021. The Atlanta-based CDC, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, then imposed its own moratorium at the behest of then-President Donald Trump, the current iteration of which is set to run out on June 30. The theory was that uprooting tenants would spread the virus, which now appears to be in decline. Violators could face criminal p…</span>

It was supposed to be the biggest threat to the reserve status of the dollar (China&#x27;s denial that it has no desire to replace the USD with the digital yuan only confirms it) since the failed experiment that is the &quot;whatever it takes&quot; euro, but instead it is turning out to be one giant yawn.

                    <span>The Mysterious $85 Billion Surge In China&#x27;s FX Reverse Repo

            
By Ye Xie, Bloomberg reporter and Markets Live commentator


A mysterious surge in dollar lending by Chinese banks in an arcane corner of the financial market is leading some investors to wonder whether it’s somehow related to the “stealth intervention” by the PBOC to slow yuan appreciation.


For years, Chinese banks had little use for foreign-currency reverse repo, which is effectively collateralized lending. That has dramatically changed since the pandemic. Banks’ FX reverse repos surged to a record $87 billion in April, from less than $2 billion a year earlier.


“Historically, Chinese banks FX assets and liabilities have consisted almost exclusively of loans and deposits,” Alex Etra, a senior strategist …</span>

                    <span>Blinken Says Biden Will Put &quot;Future Cyberattacks&quot; Front &amp; Center In Putin Summit

            
Secretary of State Antony Blinken in an appearance on &quot;Axios on HBO&quot; previewed what he expects to come out of the Putin-Biden summit set for June 16 in Geneva. The short answer is: not much except for vague warnings and threats, it appears. Blinken said during the interview that the US president intends to warn Putin &quot;directly and clearly what he can expect from the United States if aggressive, reckless actions toward us continue.&quot;


While explaining that Washington would prefer a &quot;more stable&quot; relationship with Russia, Blinken also sought to distance the White House from growing criticism that Biden is getting &#x27;weak&#x27; on promises to &quot;stand up&quot; to Putin, particularly after recently dropping sa…</span>

                    <span>The Currency Story Has Undergone A Silent, Subtle Curve Shift

            
By Ven Ram, Bloomberg reporter and macro commentator


Front-end yields held hostage by central banks around the world have engendered a silent shift in currency pricing: exchange movements are being increasingly influenced by changes in the intermediate and longer segments of the yield curve.


Currencies that were typically more responsive to relative changes in yields at, say, the two-year part of the curve are now responding more and more to shifts at the five- and 10-year segments, with the dollar being a case in point.







The chart above shows how closely the Dollar Index has tracked five-year real yield spreads between the U.S. and Germany (hat tip to J. Paul Knight, assistant portfolio manager of U.S. large-cap equity at the Employees Retirement System of Texas for his observation). Indeed, the correlation between the spreads and the dollar in the past year is running at 0.57, reflecting its influence on the currency. Taken together with 10-year differentials , the two points of the curve delineate the trajectory of the dollar by more than four-fifths.







To be sure, it wasn’t always like this. Take a look at this chart above that encompasses a longer time frame, which shows the Dollar Index ignoring the movement in spreads. That was a time clearly before the pandemic when the U.S. economy was still in the midst of its longest post-war expansion, with central banks not anywhere near controlling the yield curve, de facto or de jure.

It looks like much to the surprise of no one, there&#x27;s considerable waste and malfeasance taking place at the perpetually-taxpayer-bailed-out MTA.


A new MTA inspector general&#x27;s report has revealed that MTA track engineers - to quote Rep. Al Green talking about Citadel earlier this year - &quot;have been naughty for some time&quot;.


The inspector general is reportedly &quot;furious&quot; after the findings of an 11 month investigation found that seven NYC Transit track inspectors were skipping inspections and falsifying inspection reports. The employees in question have been suspended, according to an RT&amp;S report.


But rather than fire all seven employees - in true tax…</span>

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


Malaysian police are using drones which can check temperatures from as high as 20 meters above ground in the latest example of coronavirus population control.







The drones alert authorities if someone has a high temperature reading by emitting a red light, according to Bernama, Malaysia’s state news agency.


“Malaysian police have previously warned they will use drones to enforce earlier travel restrictions, with officers in some areas also stating they would carry out surprise home visits to ensure people were following rules,” reports the Guardian.

Tokyo Police are investigating an apparent suicide on Monday morning (local time) of a senior official at the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC) who jumped in front of a subway train. 


Nippon TV&#x27;s News24 channel reports Yasushi Moriya, who led JOC&#x27;s accounting department, apparently ended his own life in the Tokyo Metro system. Police have yet to release details surrounding the death of the official.

Imagine sitting in the seat of a central banker in June of 2021. You are looking down the barrel of millions of AMC nutjobs making up 9% of all U.S. equity market option volume on Friday and 8.2 million jobless Americans.


Since Jackson Hole (August 2020) you have been lecturing most of the planet ́s inhabitants that ridding the world of inequality is closest to your heart. Above all your message has been, “we did it all wrong in previous hiking cycles in pulling back accommodation too soon, this time we are going to let it run hot and lift all Americans up into the heavens.”

A New York parent brought the heat to members of the Carmel Central School District board for &#x27;emotionally abusing&#x27; children by &#x27;indoctrinating them with communist values.&#x27;







In comments at a school board business meeting in Putnam County, NY on Thursday, parent Tatiyana Ibrahim - whose child is a student, slammed the educators for promoting Critical Race Theory (CRT), Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ and anti-police ideologies both on and off campus.


&quot;Stop indoctrinating our children. Stop teaching our children to hate the police. Stop teaching our children that if they don’t agree with the LGBT community that they’re homophobic. You have no idea each child’s life,&quot; she said, adding &quot;You don’t know what their family lifestyle consists of, you don’t know the makeup of their life.&quot;


Watch:





Ibrahim shut down school board members&#x27; objections several times - in between calling out two teachers for posting their political beliefs online. When board members told her she wasn&#x27;t allowed to reference people by name, Ibrahim claimed those teachers called &quot;for the death of a former president,&quot; and that students who don&#x27;t support Black Lives Matter should be &quot;canceled out.&quot;


&quot;Why are we not allowed to say names? Why am I not allowed when they purposefully expose themselves on social media, talking about calling for the death of a former president, or saying that any child who doesn’t believe in Black Lives Matter should be canceled out. Is this what my tax dollars are paying for?&quot; she asked.


&quot;You’re emotionally abusing our children and mentally abusing them,&quot; Ibrahim continued. &quot;You’re demoralizing them by teaching them communist values, this is still America, ma’am.&quot;

By Tom Ozimek of The Epoch Times


Texas has joined a coalition of what is now 25 states urging the U.S. Supreme Court to repeal a New Jersey law banning the possession of firearms with magazines that hold more than 10 bullets, arguing the prohibition violates the Second Amendment and puts law-abiding citizens less able to defend themselves against dangerous criminals.


Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced in a statement that he had signed onto an amicus brief (pdf) which argues that allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms with 11-plus capacity magazines benefits public safety, counterbalances the threat of illegal gun violence, and helps “make our streets safer.”…</span>

Interestingly, ETH is still outperforming BTC in this downturn, back near recent relative highs...







Some are suggesting that this is the DoJ dumping the crypto they have recovered from recent ransomware attacks in an effort to &#x27;teach&#x27; the crypto crooks a lesson.

Back in October, before &quot;meme stocks&quot; had become &quot;a thing&quot; and a share of GME could be purchased for less than $15, we noted that former porn star Lana Rhoades had apparently stumbled on to a new, potentially more lucrative, line of work: pitching &#x27;trading seminars&#x27; and other products (up to and including s***coins).


Since then, Rhoades has really made a go of it, pitching coins like &quot;cumrocket&quot; and &quot;titcoin&quot;. Over the weekend, however, she apparently touched a nerve by posing with a copy of Benjamin Graham&#x27;s seminal finance book &quot;the Intelligent Investor&quot; in a pitch for &quot;pawgcoin&quot;, yet another shitcoin focused on the adult entertainment industry.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Below is my column in the Hill on the future of the filibuster and why this may be the most credible period for the use of such a compromise-forcing rule. There have always been good-faith arguments against the use of such a rule as inhibiting democratic voting. After all, the rule blocks bare majority voting. However, with a razor-thin margin in both houses, the use of such a rule can help force greater dialogue and compromise in Congress, which most voters indicate that they want in polls. It now appears that Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.V.) will block the federal voting rights legislation even without a filibuster. As a result he was attacked …</span>

Amazon shares tumbled to their lowest levels of the session on Monday amid reports that Amazon would be included in a G-7 deal cemented over the weekend to retool the minimum corporate tax in some of the world&#x27;s wealthiest nations (though a US-led movement to force the proposal down the throats of reluctant Ireland, Singapore and other low-tax nations remains very much in doubt).







As we learned over the weekend via a communique from G-7 ministers, a pillar of the deal envisaged that the tax would apply on &quot;profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises.&quot; Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s low-margin e-commerce business, the firm doesn&#x27;t technically meet that cutoff, as t…</span>

People caught on that the returns on the frenzied hamster wheel of &quot;normal&quot; have been diminishing for decades, but everyone was too busy to notice.


The superficial &quot;return to normal&quot; narrative focuses solely on first order effects: now that people can dispense with masks and social distancing, they are resuming their pre-pandemic spending orgy with a vengeance, which augurs great profits for Corporate America and higher tax revenues. Yea for &quot;return to normal.&quot;


This superficial narrative ignores second-order effects of the pandemic. Recall that first order effects: every action has a consequence. Second order effects: every consequence has its own consequence. We ca…</span>

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called for Dr. Anthony Fauci to resign from his position as head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) following the publication of a trove of hundreds of emails.







McCarthy, speaking to Breitbart News over the past weekend, said that the American public has lost trust in Fauci after emails released last week raised questions about how Fauci handled the COVID-19 pandemic and his messaging to media outlets. Fauci has defended his emails and said they are being taken out of context.

                    <span>Consumer Credit Hits New Record Despite Unexpected Decline In Credit Card Usage

            
After several months of blowout consumer credit prints, including two consecutive months in which revolving (i.e., credit card) debt, rose after shrinking 10 of the previous 11 months, America&#x27;s credit-funded spending spree abruptly slowed in April, when total consumer credit rose by $18.6BN, down from $25.8BN in March (since revised conveniently to $18.6BN), and missing expectations of $20.5BN. Overall, total consumer credit rose at a 5.3% annual rate in April to a new all time high of $4.238 trillion.


What was most notable about the April data, however, is that revolving credit actually declined by $1.96 billion to $964 billion, well below the record high of $1.094 trillion reached in Dece…</span>

The Department of Justice announced on Monday that they&#x27;ve recovered some $4.4 million dollars worth of Bitcoin paid in ransom to hackers who prompted the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline, according to CNN, which notes that &quot;The ransom recovery is a rare outcome for a company that has fallen victim to a debilitating cyberattack in the booming criminal business of ransomware.&quot;



Colonial Pipeline Co. CEO Joseph Blount told The Wall Street Journal In an interview published last month that the company complied with the $4.4 million ransom demand because officials didn&#x27;t know the extent of the intrusion by hackers and how long it would take to restore operations.

Former President Donald Trump planned to haul Anthony Fauci in front of a US presidential commission as part of a larger effort to hold China and its collaborators responsible for the pandemic, according to The Australian.







Trump&#x27;s team, spearheaded by adviser Peter Navarro, had gone so far as to draft an executive order and compile a reparations bill, however the advanced plans were scrapped at the last minute after Trump&#x27;s ever-helpful advisers (Larry Kudlow in particular) talked him out of it, according to an upcoming book on the origins of COVID-19, What Really Happened in Wuhan.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Senator Rand Paul told Sean Hannity Friday that he is receiving death threats almost every day for daring to question the authority of Dr Anthony Fauci, as well as highlighting evidence that the coronavirus could have leaked from a Wuhan lab.







“This week, I’ve had five death threats just for being outspoken on it,” Paul said, adding “I don’t know what the world’s coming to, you can’t ask honest, difficult questions that in the end have proved out that Dr. Fauci was not being honest with us.”


Paul continued “As a repercussion, my family had white powder sent to our house, and five death threats phoned in.”

It still looks like we are nowhere near the end of the ongoing global semi chip shortage. Even worse, more manufacturers are confirming that the shortage could last &quot;for at least another year&quot;, catalyzed by sharp post-pandemic demand for automobiles and electronics. 


Flex, the world’s third-biggest electronics contract manufacturer, offered up the &quot;gloomiest&quot; forecast for the crisis yet to FT this week. The company has more than 100 sites in 30 countries and works with major names like Dyson and HP.

Following up on The Trap which suggested recent market strength may turn into a bull trap.







Last week again we saw the tiniest dip in markets instantly reverted and markets again closed at the weekly highs on Friday, near all time highs as a matter of fact. Indeed, the historical backtest scenarios outlined in The Trap permit for marginal new highs. And in keeping with observing the set up develop we can note that during this renewed run higher last week we saw something we haven’t seen since the last major top.


Transports diverged in a fairly pronounced fashion and we’re seeing this divergence again this morning:

Following conflicts over trade, technology, and capital markets, the US and China are locked in a great power competition, as some describe it as Thucydides Trap. We believe the battleground for global supremacy is heating up on the hypersonic front. 


According to South China Morning Post (SCMP), researcher Han Guilai, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said a new wind tunnel in Beijing will &quot;soon be unveiled&quot; and put China decades ahead of the West in hypersonic technology. 


Guilai told an online lecture in late May that the JF-22 wind tunnel, in Beijing&#x27;s Huairou district, was capable of simulating flights at 30 times the speed of sound. He said this would put China &quot;about 20 to 30 years a…</span>

                    <span>Top Pennsylvania Senator Says He Supports Election Audit

            
Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


A top senator in Pennsylvania said Saturday that he supports an audit of the 2020 presidential election.



“I support the call for an election audit, in order to answer any lingering questions that still remain about the fairness of the 2020 elections in Pennsylvania. This is the best path forward to address the legitimate concerns of the large majority of my constituents who voted to reelect President [Donald] Trump, as well as all Pennsylvanians,” state Sen. David Argall, a Republican who chairs the Pennsylvania Senate’s State Government Committee, told The Epoch Times in an emailed statement.

Last week, when Biden released his $6 trillion budget, we asked if it was a joke that the BIden budget saw just 2.1% inflation in 2021 and 2022.



Is this a joke: the BIden budget sees 2.1% CPI in 2021 and 2022

Fast forward to this weekend, when Fed Chair Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen addressed our rhetorical concern, and following the G7 finmin meeting in London where the world&#x27;s most advanced nations agreed to impose a 15% minimum corporate tax rate (with zero enforcement provisions), said that contrary to the Biden Budget, inflation could climb as high as 3% this year in what the WaPo said was &quot;the first time the Biden administration projected …</span>

As small businesses complain that it has never been harder for them to hire workers according to a recent NFIB survey, many are facing growing pressure to survive. As the American economy continues to reopen, some fear it might not happen soon enough to save thousands of small businesses. Data from Alignable&#x27;s June Revenue Poll shows that 35% of all small business owners are still at risk of closing permanently by the end of the summer.


Among the 3,772 small business owners in the 10 days ended June 1, Alignable&#x27;s June Revenue Poll showed a myriad of factors - including the remaining closures and restrictions, growing inflationary pressures on prices, rising gas and transportation prices and la…</span>

Surging construction costs to build a new home is not sustainable and is becoming a pain in the arse for homebuilders and prospective homebuyers. From concrete to lumber to copper pipes to paint and even appliances, costs have surged over the past year.

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


The Georgia Republican Party on Saturday approved a resolution censuring Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, local media reported.


The Georgia GOP during a convention approved a resolution that says Raffensperger, a Republican, failed to perform his duties in “accordance with the laws of the Constitution of the State of Georgia,” WSB-TV reported.







The document says the failure stemmed from Raffensperger entering into a settlement agreement with the Democratic Party of Georgia, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.


The agreement saw Raffensperger agree to promote …</span>

In the latest surreal and brazen example of federal government overreach, the FBI is demanding that USA Today turn over the IP addresses of all individuals who accessed a public online article during a specific time period. 


The subpoena was issued in April but is only in recent days being made public after the newspaper&#x27;s parent company Gannett sought to fight it in court. It&#x27;s being widely condemned as an outrageous instance of abuse not only of press freedom, but of the public&#x27;s right to access information and media as well as breach of both the 1st and 4th Amendments.

The number of COVID-19 deaths in Alameda County, California, fell by about 25 percent after health officials changed their methodology for total mortality count, removing those that were not a “direct result” of the disease, or “in whom death caused by COVID-19 could not be ruled out.”

Authored by Jason Ditz via AntiWar.com,


Political rancor and tensions surround the 2020 election had many US companies trying to distance themselves from the process by halting political donations. This included one of the biggest sectors for buying influence, the arms industry.


After a few months to reexamine things, the arms companies are back to throwing money around, donating in large quantities to members of both parties involved in military spending, and trying to ensure that they stay on good terms with everyone responsible for their business’ contracts.

                    <span>NASA&#x27;s Mars Helicopter Prepares For 7th Flight On Sunday

            
Liftoff of NASA&#x27;s Mars helicopter Ingenuity will occur no later than today if all goes to plan, according to a NASA press release. 


Ingenuity, a small robotic helicopter weighing no more than 4 pounds, is preparing for its seventh flight today. The mission is to fly Ingenuity 350 feet south from its current location on the floor of Jezero Crater. 



&quot;This will mark the second time the helicopter will land at an airfield that it did not survey from the air during a previous flight,&quot; NASA wrote. &quot;Instead, the Ingenuity team is relying on imagery collected by the HiRISE camera aboard NASA&#x27;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that suggests this new base of operations is relatively flat and has few surface obstructions.&quot;



On May 22, Ingenuity flew its sixth mission that did not go so well. The solar-powered helicopter experienced glitches that interrupted internal systems. There was no mention of what caused the glitches; the craft was able to land safely. 







Ingenuity has marvelously performed five flights and beamed incredible images from Mars back to Earth. 


NASA also has the Perseverance rover conducting land-based missions in the search for life. 


In the last couple of months, the Red Planet has become a hotspot for the US and China, with China landing a rover of its own on the planet.


Sudden interest in Mars between both countries is because the planet allegedly has an abundance of rare metals that will power tomorrow&#x27;s economy.

NORMANDY, France, June 6, 1944


In a surprise aggressive move, American and British troops are landing on the beaches in Normandy today. 







Germany’s Transocean News Service reports that Germans vacationing in the sleepy hamlets of this coastal region were awakened by the ships, planes, guns, and bombs of this sneak attack. A few brave German tourists quickly ran to bunkers and began returning fire to protect their French brothers and sisters.


Germany has already been subject to a horrifying 363 air raids by the Allied air forces in an attempt to terrorize its citizens. British bombers have already dropped over 45,000 tons of bombs while American aircraft dropped 23,000 tons. Nearly 1.7 mill…</span>

                    <span>The Importance Of Equity Duration

            
By Variant Perception


We have seen much commentary that if US 10y yields go back to 2.5% or 3.0%, then equity markets suffer.  We prefer a different way to looking at the problem.  The key is what inflation is doing alongside any move in nominal yields. The below chart shows the % of the US yield curve trading below inflation. We highlight in green the periods when more than 50% of the yield curve is trading below inflation (as is the case today).

Typically, negative real yields are very stimulative for equities.  It is only when most of the yield curve is trading above inflation (white bars in right chart above) that equity markets start to face persistent headwinds.


Equity investors do need to worry about rising yields in terms of sector rotation.  Duration is a basic concept for fixed income investors, but for equity investors, it is a less common method to look at portfolio exposures.


We have built a duration calculator for equities, using a combination of a 15-year DCF (consensus earnings forecasts, 2% terminal growth rate, individual cost of equity) and a terminal value duration component. This allows us to see which equities are most sensitive to a move in yields.


For the stocks in the Russell 1000, we calculate the duration of each name and aggregate to find the duration for different sectors. Financials, energy and consumer staples look like relative safe-havens. Info tech, healthcare and consumer discretionaries have the highest durations and are more vulnerable to yield moves.

Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),


California, with its relatively large tax burden compared to other states, has seen a taxpayer exodus in recent years and, along with it, billions in taxable gross income.


State-to-state migration data recently released by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shows that California lost an estimated net 70,534 households—or 165,355 taxpayers and their dependents—in the years 2017-2018, with those fleeing taking around $8.8 billion in net adjusted gross income with them.

We have written extensively in the past few months (here, here, here, and here) discussing the costs (both fiscally and to freedom) and consequences (both intended and unintended) of the so-called &quot;For The People&quot; Act, it appears at least one Democrat politician has decided that the power grab is too much.







In a sweeping op-ed in the Charleston Gazette-Mail, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) explained why he will vote against the sweeping election reform overhaul bill, putting the fate of the legislation in jeopardy in the evenly split Senate.

                    <span>&quot;Shot Heard Around The World&quot; - El Salvador President Pushes Bill To Adopt Bitcoin As Legal Tender

            
In a pre-recorded video, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele made a somewhat shocking announcement in the final hours of the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami on Saturday afternoon.







Bukele said Saturday he will send a bill to the Central American country&#x27;s Congress next week to make bitcoin legal tender.



#Bitcoin has a market cap of $680 billion dollars.

If 1% of it is invested in El Salvador, that would increase our GDP by 25%.

On the other side, #Bitcoin will have 10 million potential new users and the fastest growing way to transfer 6 billion dollars a year in remittances.

“Drift. Apathy. Distrust,” barked Biggie Too, feeling it, already in a groove.  “Frustration. Irritation. Uneasy anticipation,” continued the chief global strategist for one of Wall Street’s Too-Big-To-Fail affairs.


“Biggie got this deep dark feeling he’s way too early,” whispered Too, lips pursed, right at home in 3rd person. “We lost our faith in politicians and the media. Institutions. Now we’re losing trust in science, our scientists, Biggie sees them cracks spreading,” said Biggie, pointing to his bank of screens, Fauci getting Fox’d.

If you had said during the beginning of the pandemic we&#x27;d be talking about whether or not retailer GameStop and dying movie chain AMC would be moved from the Russell 2000 up to the large cap Russell 1000 - instead of being dropped from the index altogether - people would have assumed you were joking.


But now that question is legitimately on the table thanks to the astronomical run in both names and the upcoming Russell Reconstitution, according to Bloomberg.


The reconstitution, which takes place on June 25, is going to affect more than $10 trillion in investors&#x27; assets and exchange volumes are usually &quot;among the heaviest of the year&quot; around the time it happens.

By Michael Wilson, chief equity strategist of Morgan Stanley


Over the past few weeks, we’ve been spending a lot of time with investors discussing and debating our mid-year outlook. Here are the highlights:



First, investors are definitely more receptive to the mid-cycle transition narrative that we introduced a few months ago. There’s an acknowledgement that something has changed in the market, because more investors are struggling to make money consistently as leadership flip-flops day to day. This is consistent with the typical mid-cycle transition as the market struggles to find the next consensus trade.

Authored by Bryce Coward via Knowledge Leaders Capital blog,


For the second month in a row, the US payroll employment report has come in below expectations. The miss this month was not quite as bad as the miss last month, but was still notable. The market was expecting 675K new jobs, but only 559K were added.


Nearly all of the jobs added were in the leisure &amp; hospitality and education categories. This is unsurprising given re-openings will affect those sectors particularly acutely. But, for the second month in a row we also saw fairly weak numbers out of both construction and manufacturing. Construction jobs fell by 20K while manufacturing jobs only rose by 23K after a 32K decline in April. F…</span>

For the past several months, Morgan Stanley&#x27;s fundamental analysts have been turning increasingly bearish on stocks, with the pessimistic sentiment plateauing earlier this week when chief equity strategist Michael Wilson said that there is far too much optimism in the market, and that while earnings are slowly rising, forward PE multiples are far too high and are set to slide, with &quot;the de-rating about 75% to go or an approximate 15% decline in P/Es from here.&quot; As a result, in Wilson&#x27;s view - which is rapidly emerging as the most bearish on Wall Street - &quot;earnings revisions will not be able to offset that de-rating, leaving the overall market vulnerable to a 10-15 % correction over the…</span>

A person believed to be among the highest-ranking defectors ever to the United States from the People’s Republic of China has been working with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for months, sources inside the intelligence community have told RedState on condition of anonymity.







The defector has direct knowledge of special weapons programs in China, including bioweapons programs, those sources say.


The information provided to RedState corroborates and clarifies Thursday evening’s reporting by journalist Adam Housley.

Are the carbon footprints of EVs really as drastically lower than that of internal combustion engine vehicles? When considering the amount of carbon and CO2 created from assembling lithium ion batteries, one firm thinks the difference could be &quot;negligible&quot;.


Such was the topic of a new blog post by natural resource investors Goehring &amp; Rozencwajg (G&amp;R), a &quot;fundamental research firm focused exclusively on contrarian natural resource investments with a team with over 30 years of dedicated resource experience.&quot;


The firm, established in 2015, posted a blog entry entitled &quot;Exploring Lithium-ion Electric Vehicles’ Carbon Footprint&quot; this week, where they call into question a former ICE vs. …</span>

1. U.S. Taxpayer Money Did Go to Controversial ‘Gain of Function’ Research


Thanks to some confusing verbal gymnastics by Dr. Anthony Fauci, some in the media are giving the impression that there’s no proof U.S. tax money funded “gain of function” research or that, perhaps, the research didn’t qualify as gain of function. However, the evidence on this point is clear cut.


A 2015 published study specifically discloses that the research is gain of function research that took bat coronavirus that was harmless to people—and made it infectious in humans. The study further states that the National Institutes of He…</span>

Last month we noted how hedge fund managers have been descending on Puerto Rico in the hopes of dodging Biden tax hikes, and to take advantage of tax incentives rolled out in 2012 which have lured high net-worth individuals, corporations and cryptocurrency traders alike.







If you fall under any of the above and you&#x27;re falsely claiming to be a resident of Puerto Rico, the IRS has a message for you: &#x27;We&#x27;re waiting for you...&#x27; 


According to Bloomberg Tax, the agency has been the focus of a &quot;sweeping&quot; review to examine individuals who took advantages of the tax incentives. According to the report, &quot;More than 4,000 mainland U.S. residents and firms have moved to the territory between 20…</span>

Donald Trump will return to the political stage Saturday night with a speech at the North Carolina Republican Convention - his first major speech since CPAC in February, but more importantly - his first since he was vindicated over the possibility that COVID-19 escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.







It also comes after anti-Trump GOP Congresswoman Liz Cheney (WY) was outed from her leadership position due to her frequent criticism of Trump.


In a Friday statement, the former president said that it would be &quot;a great honor to be speaking at the North Carolina GOP convention,&quot; adding &quot;I understand the place will be packed, all records broken!&quot;


Trump carried North Carolina during both of his presidential bids - visiting the state 14 times during the final year of his presidency. He&#x27;s scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. to a sold out audience of 1,250 people.

                    <span>COVID, Learned Helplessness, And Control

            
Via WeMeantWell.com,


In the post-vaccination era, why don’t people remove their masks? Learned helplessness, employed as a control tool.







Learned helplessness is well-documented. It takes place when an individual believes he continuously faces a negative, uncontrollable situation and stops trying to improve his circumstances, even when he has the ability to do so. Discovering the loss of control elicits a passive reaction to a harmful situation. Psychologists call this a maladaptive response, characterized by avoidance of challenges and the collapse of problem-solving when obstacles arise. You give up trying to fight back.


An example may help: you must keep up with ever-changing mask and other hygiene theatre rules,…</span>

                    <span>A Couple Things About Inflation

            
Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


The higher they push phantom &quot;assets&quot; based on exponential increases in leverage, the greater the air gap between essential tangibles and fantasy.


Inflation is in the news, but there are a couple of things about inflation that don&#x27;t get much coverage. Let&#x27;s start with the trope that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. Actually, no.


When nutrient-rich soil and fresh water reserves are depleted, crop yields decline and as human population and appetites for animal protein soar, food becomes scarce. When food becomes scarce, prices rise accordingly. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you do with money supply, prices will rise in relation to everything used as &quot;money:&quot; gold, shells, paper …</span>

                    <span>Hong Kong Parking Spot Sells For Record-Breaking $1.3 Million

            
Even as thousands of Hong Kongers flee to the UK or elsewhere to escape China&#x27;s crackdown on political freedoms, the city-state&#x27;s property market is breaking yet another record.


Citing a report in the Hong Kong Economic Times, Bloomberg reports that Wharf Holdings and Nan Fung Group sold a parking space for HK$10.2 million ($1.3 million) at the luxury Mount Nicholson residential project, according to a source. The price beat the previous record of HK$7.6 million for a spot in an office tower set back in 2019, before Hong Kong&#x27;s protest movement triggered a crackdown by Beijing that has engulfed the territory&#x27;s future in uncertainty, especially since China can simply snatch anyone - foreign nationals or otherwise - from Hong Kong&#x27;s jurisdiction.







Mount Nicholson has a reputation for being one of the most iconic upscale projects in Hong Kong. At one point, an apartment in the project was the most expensive in Asia before the title was taken by CK Asset Holdings Ltd.’s 21 Borrett Road in February.


As that record-breaking sale might suggest, the parking spot record isn&#x27;t a total surprise. HK has been seeing a comeback in the luxury home market in recent months, seeing record-breaking transactions as buyer&#x27;s confidence returns. A house on Hong Kong&#x27;s famous Peak (a luxury residential area overlooking the rest of the city) just rented for HK$1.6 a month in May.


Still, despite its recent sharp rebound, Hong Kong&#x27;s economy &quot;isn&#x27;t out of the woods just yet,&quot; according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau. HK&#x27;s economy grew 7.9% in the first quarter of 2021 vs. a year ago, marking the first economic expansion after six consecutive quarters of contraction. Yau appeared on CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Squawk Box Asia&quot; Thursday morning to discuss it.





While retail sales have seen a strong rebound, tourism remains weak, and the expansion is on uneven footing, Yau said.

Authored by Finn Andersen via The Mises Institute,


Recently, Joe Rogan, one of the largest podcast hosts in the United States (10.6 million YouTube subscribers), expressed the following opinion about the vaccination of young adults:



If you are 21 and ask me if you should get the vaccine, I would say &quot;no&quot;. If you are a healthy person and exercise all the time, and are young and eat well, I don&#x27;t think you have to worry about this.

An official event at the Yale School of Medicine featured a New York-based psychiatrist telling students she fantasizes about &quot;unloading a revolver into the head of any white person that got in my way.&quot;


Disturbingly the talk entitled &quot;The Psychopathic Problem of the White Mind&quot; was held as part of the continuing program, the Child Study Center Grand rounds. The event was held in April, but audio only late this week of New York-based Dr. Aruna Khilanani gleefully musing about murdering white people became available and was posted on journalist Bari Weiss&#x27;s Substack.

Authored by Rita Li via The Epoch Times,


A recent report documented up to 6,000 foreign fishing vessels that disabled their public tracking devices for more than 24 hours along the border of Argentina’s national waters, sounding the alarm that they could be illegally fishing in the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).


“The Chinese fleet was responsible for 66 percent of these incidents,” said the June report by Oceana, a Washington-based non-profit organization dedicated to protecting and restoring the global oceans. The report claims that hundreds of Chinese fishing vessels mainly target shortfin squid, which is vital to both Argentina’s economy and ecosystem.

                    <span>Three US Senators Visit Taiwan Sunday In Another Shot Across China&#x27;s Bow

            
Taiwan is about to be front and center again this coming week as Washington prepares for its next shot across China&#x27;s bow - this time by another high level US delegation, something which China has long condemned as &quot;signaling pro-democracy forces&quot; on the island in contradiction to the official One China policy. 


Reuters has confirmed in a weekend report that &quot;Three US senators will visit Taiwan on Sunday and will meet President Tsai Ing-wen to discuss security and other issues, Taiwan&#x27;s government and the de facto U.S. embassy in Taipei said on Saturday, a trip that will likely irritate China.&quot; The meeting is expected to be held at a military wing of the island&#x27;s main international airport.

Authored by Mark Jeftovic via BombThrower.com,


Earlier today the news started coming out that the US will start treating ransomware on par with terrorism. This is in the wake of a string of catastrophic attacks, not only ransomware but also several supply chain attacks.


There is some concern within crypto-currency circles that this may turn into a new FUD-cycle for Bitcoin. There is already no shortage of lo-res intellects calling for a ban on Bitcoin and crypto-currencies, thinking that even if cryptos could be banned (they can’t) that it would eliminate the problem of ransomware.


It wouldn’t.


Here’s why:


Ransomware attacks are neither enabled nor incentivized by the existence of Bitcoin. …</span>

                    <span>&quot;Stonks On The Moon&quot;: There&#x27;s Now A Children&#x27;s Book Based On The GameStop Short Squeeze

            
There&#x27;s now officially a children&#x27;s book based on the &quot;Great GME Squeeze of 2021&quot;.


Amazon has started selling a book called &quot;Stonks On The Moon!&quot; which tells the story - in children&#x27;s parlance - of the &quot;mayhem being inflicted on Wall Street by a new wave of retail investors championing the cause of GameStop Corp,&quot; according to WeBull.


The story tells the tale of Stonks, a young ape, who is helped along by a character based on Keith &quot;Roaring Kitty&quot; Gill in building a rocket to visit the moon. 


According to WeBull, the book&#x27;s author, who goes by the name &quot;Professor Clark&quot; is actually Dillon Clark, who calls himself &quot;an IT professional at a bank in the middle of Illinois in the middle of a cornfield.&quot; 







Clark said: “It&#x27;s kind of a children&#x27;s book for adults and children. A kid can read it and be like, ‘Hey, I understand it. I get a good message from it.&#x27; But then the adult can read it and be like, ‘Oh, I see what&#x27;s going on there&#x27;.”


“It&#x27;s been great,” he stated. “All the apes on Reddit have been super, super nice.”


Clark is also holding out hope that Elon Musk will read the audio version: “I think ‘Stonks on the Moon!’ would be awesome if Elon Musk narrated. I&#x27;ve been tweeting at him every day for the last 35 days, and I&#x27;m doing it for a year straight.”


The book is 25 pages and already has 35 reviews with an average of 5 stars on Amazon, where it started selling on May 27. 







Meanwhile, the Fed still sees no signs of market excess...

Authored by Mimi Nguyen Ly via The Epoch Times,


Microsoft on Friday said that its search engine Bing yielded no results when users entered the query “tank man” in the United States and elsewhere for part of Friday because of “accidental human error.”







Users in the United States and other countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and Singapore, reported that Bing returned the message “There are no results for tank man” when they tried to search the term.


Meanwhile, rival search engine Google, on the other hand, returned many results for the image when the “tank man” query was entered on Friday.


Some social media users raised concerns that Bing, one of the few …</span>

The day after Putin announced the completion of the first leg of the Russia-to-Germany natural gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, declaring that essentially Washington&#x27;s best efforts to halt it via an avalanche of sanctions have been defeated, Germany appears to have seconded his assessment.


German Ambassador to Russia Geza Andreas von Geyr on Saturday in his own statements on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum said that US efforts are illegal, going against international law.

Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,


Over the last few week’s we discussed the ongoing “buy signals” suggesting the market could retest all-time highs. That occurred this week. However, as stated last week:



“The good news is that we did indeed get the rally we were expecting. The not-so-good news is that the rally already consumed a majority of the ‘buy signal.’ Such does not mean the market is about to correct; it does suggest that upside remains limited near term.”








As shown in the bottom panel, the RIA PRO “Money Flow” signal is now into overbought territory. While the markets could undoubtedly break out to new highs next week, the upside remains limited. Such is due to the weekly sig…</span>

While the luminaries of the crypto world are spending millions of dollar to pitch their favorite tokens and technologies at the world&#x27;s largest cryptoconference in Miami (which due to organizational issues has also been compared to the infamous Fyre Festival scam) hoping to push the prices of bitcoin and its peers higher, Elon Musk had other plans.


First, on Thursday evening, bitcoin tumbled after the Tesla billionaire issued a cryptic tweet that many interpreted as the billionaire’s breakup with bitcoin. The tweet, which included the bitcoin logo and a broken-heart emoji, hinted that Musk may have sold some or all of Tesla&#x27;s bitcoin holdings purchased at the start of the year (Musk has yet to confirm or deny that…</span>

Minneapolis saw an outbreak of unrest on Friday night, after a vigil and protests over the shooting death of a man by members of a U.S. Marshals task force devolved into chaotic scenes of looting, arson, and vandalism.

The second night of protests followed Thursday’s fatal shooting of 32-year-old Winston Boogie Smith Jr., who was wanted on a weapons violation and fired a gun before two deputies shot him.


Members of the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force were trying to arrest Smith on a warrant for allegedly being a felon in possessi…</span>

Liberals are probably having a meltdown after a George W. Bush-appointed federal judge in California ruled the state&#x27;s ban on assault weapons is unconstitutional. 







U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez of San Diego released a 94-page ruling late Friday, indicating California&#x27;s three-decade ban on assault weapons violates the Second Amendment&#x27;s right to bear arms.

A number of events are coming together which are set to push gold prices higher. Besides a combination of continuing inflationary policies and massive future budget deficits undermining the dollar, by closing down derivative market activities new Basel 3 regulations appear set to deflect some demand into physical metals. Furthermore, liquidity in gold markets will contract, potentially making prices more volatile

The G7 group of advanced economies reached a landmark deal Saturday to end the race to the bottom on taxes. 


Finance ministers - from US, UK, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, and Japan - met in London Saturday and agreed to a minimum global corporation tax rate of at least 15%, and also had put in mechanisms within the deal to ensure multinational companies operating in other countries were paying their fair share of taxes.

As even many casual observers of America’s fractious politics are aware, the overwhelming majority of lawmaking at the federal level no longer takes place in Congress as the Constitution’s framers intended. Instead, the vast majority of the “rulemaking” governing Americans’ day-to-day lives now takes place behind closed doors, deep in the bowels of the administrative state’s sprawling bureaucracy. The brainchild of progressive President Woodrow Wilson, arguments on behalf of the modern administrative state are ultimately rooted in, among other factors, a disdain for the messy give-and-take of republican politics and an epistemological preference for rul…</span>

Cows produce significant amounts of methane as part of their digestive processes. Cow belching, a source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, could be solved by a new methane-absorbing wearable device. 


According to Bloomberg, agriculture behemoth Cargill Inc. tapped UK-based startup Zelp Ltd., which is dedicated to significantly reducing the environmental impact of the livestock industry through smart cow masks that filter methane burps. 







Cargill said Tuesday the devices would be used for its European dairy farmers in 2022. The price of each mask has yet to be publicly discussed, but Zelp said each cow would cost $80 per year as part of an annual subscription fee.

By Construction Dive,




	
Closures due to the Covid pandemic resulted in $9.8 billion in lost construction activity and 74,000 direct and indirect lost jobs in New York City, according to a report by the Building Trades Employers’ Association. The decline in jobs contributed to a $5.5 billion loss in total wages, the report said.

	

	

	
The decline in activity also affected the city&#x27;s Minority and Women Business Enterprises, as more than 85% of MWBEs are expected to be out of businesses in the next six months, according to a New York City Comptroller&#x27;s Office survey cited in the report.

                    <span>Frenzied Crypto Traders In South Korea See Coins As Their &quot;Last Chance Of Escape&quot;

            
South Korea has become ground zero for speculative crypto traders looking to try and build wealth by hoisting their life savings into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.


This means wild successes when the price bitcoin and other coins moves higher, but also devastating mood swings when cryptos crash. 


&quot;I can&#x27;t think of anything... It&#x27;s completely unbearable,&quot; one young woman told Nikkei after investing her life savings of about $900 into virtual currency &quot;as a way to build a nest egg in a country where saving for the future&quot;.


She had been riding high in April when cryptos were making new highs, but has since experienced a 40% drawdown. She told Nikkei: &quot;I&#x27;ll have to hold until the …</span>

Authored by Jon Sanders via The American Institute for Economic Research,


If you’re among those of us who aren’t tribally invested in Covid politics but would like good information about when life will resume as normal, chances are you’re interested in herd immunity. You’re likely not interested in having to rely on the Internet Archive for good information on herd immunity. Alas, it’s become a go-to place for retrieving, as it were, previously published information on herd immunity that became inconvenient post-vaccine and then virtually Memory-Holed.

Former Temple University business school dean Moshe Porat is defending inflating his school&#x27;s ranking to U.S. News and World Report by feeding the periodical false data. 


Porat asked a judge to dismiss fraud charges against him in a May 28 court filing, claiming &quot;that the government hadn’t sufficiently shown that he profited from the alleged scheme,&quot; Bloomberg reports.


This was, of course, while he was running the school&#x27;s Richard J. Fox School of Business, which he headed up for more than 20 years. 


Porat&#x27;s lawyers argued that &quot;the Supreme Court had previously established that a certain amount of monetary gain was necessary to sustain a wire fraud charge&quot; and that such a gain c…</span>

Authored by Ryan McMaken via The Mises Institute,


In twenty-first century America, millions of Americans—Christians and social conservatives especially—are finding that the nation’s most influential institutions appear to be implacably hostile toward them.


These institutions include universities, public schools, the news media, and government bureaucracies. Moreover, corporate America has increasingly embraced a posture of hostility toward groups considered to be “right wing” or conservative.

                    <span>Manhattan Office Supply Continues To Soar Even As City Reopens 

            
More than a year since the virus pandemic began, New York City&#x27;s economy is roaring back open. But at least one segment of the metro area&#x27;s economy remains in dire straits: the office space market. 


According to Bloomberg, citing a commercial real estate brokerage report by Colliers, Manhattan&#x27;s supply of office space continues to hit new records even as leasing increases. 


The availability rate rose for a 12th straight month in May to 17%; inventory since the pandemic began jumped 70% to a whopping 92 million square feet. 


Colliers had some good news. It said demand is coming back with leases increasing 8% versus last May, while the average asking rents rose 0.4% to $73.26 a square foot.

The Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami kicked off today with libertarian and ex-presidential candidate Ron Paul slamming the Federal Reserve and saying that Bitcoin needs be “considered seriously,” given the current state of the economy and the Fed’s monetary policy.

After Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) revealed this week that her grandmother is living in a dilapidated home in Puerto Rico, which she blamed on former President Trump, scores of people began wondering why the well-off Congresswoman (who lied about growing up poor) allowed her abuela to live in squalor while she lives it up in DC.

After more than two years of UFO &#x27;evidence&#x27; via the New York Times detailing dozens of encounters between Navy pilots and unidentified aerial phenomena, the punchline - according to an upcoming government report, is: &#x27;we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s aliens, but it&#x27;s not Americans&#x27; - and therefore America should probably spend untold billions on figuring out how to make 90-degree turns at mach 5 and disappear into the ocean, after disabling a nuclear installation.


Or, as journalist Caitlin Johnstone puts it: The MSM is wasting no time using the UFO report to promote an arms race.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Most Americans believe that the coronavirus pandemic originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, with almost a quarter saying they believe it was released on purpose, according to a YouGov poll.







A total of 58% of Americans agree that its is ‘definitely or probably true’ that the virus came out of the Wuhan lab.



Wuhan virus, most agree.

58% believe China made the virus in a lab, and 24% say it was ‘released on purpose.&#x27; Sound familiar...https://t.co/j0BqPTWxdc pic.twitter.com/tTuWMEtG2C

— Paul Bedard (@SecretsBedard) June 3, 2021


The number represents a nine percent increase on findings from a year ago.


Even 43% of Democrats believe the virus came out of the lab.

Only 13% are still buying the ‘it mutated naturally from bats’ claim.


Indeed, YouGov notes “When it comes to the more specific circumstances of the virus’ emergence, 24% think it was created in a laboratory and was released on purpose, 18% think it was lab-created and escaped by accident, while a further 12% think it was a naturally occurring disease that was being examined in a laboratory but was released by accident.”


This is despite a massive co-ordinated attempt by the establishment media and big-tech to censor and dismiss the lab leak idea as a crazy ‘conspiracy theory’.

I always thought that if you lived through a revolution it would be obvious to everyone. As it turns out, that’s not true. Revolutions can be bloodless, incremental and subtle. And they don’t require a strongman. They just require a sufficient number of well-positioned true believers and cowards, like those sitting in the C-suite of nearly every major institution in American life.

                    <span>Scientist At Center Of Lab-Leak Controversy Put In Charge Of The Lancet&#x27;s Task Force To Investigate COVID Origin

            
Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Revered scientific journal The Lancet has created a ‘task force’ to investigate the origins of the coronavirus that caused a global pandemic, yet it has decided to employ as it’s leader the very guy who funded the dangerous gain of function research at the Wuhan lab and subsequently allegedly ‘bullied’ other scientists into avoiding looking into the lab as a potential source of the outbreak.







In the wake of renewed scrutiny of the lab leak hypothesis, the Lancet’s task force will reportedly “focus on analyzing data on all of the theories put forward on the origins of COVID, on the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 was …</span>

Wall Street is sticking it to... the man?


Following Wednesday&#x27;s decision by Jefferies&#x27; Prime Brokerage to suspend short sales in meme stocks such as AMC, Gamestop and Microvision, other banks are following through with steps of their own, and as Bloomberg just reported that more of Wall Street’s top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can short the most-popular meme stocks which have soared in recent days.


In addition to Jefferies, Bank of America and Citigroup are now also among firms that have adjusted their risk controls at prime-brokerage operations, Bloomberg reports citing people familiar with the moves. With memories of the massive Archegos losses still fresh, the banks are tryi…</span>

Joe Biden&#x27;s Universal Basic Income is making the unprecedented labor shortage and general chaos in the labor market worse by the day. Two months ago we first made a remarkable observation: despite some 100 million Americans not in the labor force (of which 94 million do not want a job)...







... there is now a full-blown labor shortage in the US, for one simple reason - trillions in Biden stimulus are now incentivizing potential workers not to seek gainful employment, but to sit back and collect the next stimmy check for doing absolutely nothing in what is becoming the world&#x27;s greatest &quot;under the radar&quot; experiment in Universal Basic Income.

                    <span>Traders Rush To Ship Masked Venezuelan Crude To China

            
Authored by Charles Kennedy via OilPrice.com,


Commodity traders are in a rush to ship as much Venezuelan heavy crude to China as possible before a new fuel tax kicks in, causing a 40-50-percent rise in prices, Reuters reports, citing industry insiders and shipping data.







Over the last 12 months, China has seen a 13-fold increase in imports of bitumen blends, some 90 percent of which was actually heavy crude from Venezuela, according to data from cargo tracker Vortexa Analytics. The crude was labeled as Malaysian bitumen blend to avoid sanction action from the United States.


According to Vortexa, the average daily rate of Venezuelan oil imports into China over the past year was some 324,000 barrels, which represented about two-thirds of Venezuela&#x27;s total exports of crude during the period.


However, things are about to change as China plans to introduce a tax on bitumen blend imports later this month. This will increase prices by 40 to 50 percent, and the flow of Venezuelan oil may well thin considerably.



&quot;While not all of the 350,000 to 400,000 bpd of the additional bitumen flowing into China will disappear overnight, a large proportion of it will be at risk,&quot; an Energy Aspects analyst told Reuters.



U.S. sanctions have reduced Venezuelan oil output to some half a million barrels daily over the two years since they were introduced.







Even though the Biden administration has extended a sanction waiver for several U.S. oil companies, including Chevron and Halliburton, PDVSA is struggling to maintain production.


Earlier this year, the state-owned oil major calculated it would need investments of $58 billion to boost production to where it was before Hugo Chavez rose to power in the late 90s. In 1998, Venezuela was pumping 2.3 million barrels of crude daily. The company said it planned to seek investments from both local and foreign companies to that end.

Ahead of the G-20 summit in the UK later this month, finance ministers from the G-7 are reportedly on the cusp of a deal for a minimum corporate tax rate of &quot;at least 15%&quot;, while differences remain about how megacap tech firms should be taxed. The group will hold a series of virtual and in-person meetings over the weekend where talks will continue.


According to Bloomberg, the ministers are meeting on Friday and Saturday in London, and will likely release a statement over the weekend once they have settled on a mutually-agreeable framework. However, a deal involving just the members of the G-7 won&#x27;t amount to much, since developed economies with competitive corporate tax rates (li…</span>

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Senator Rand Paul, who has constantly challenged the contradictory and unscientific statements of Dr Fauci, as well as pointing out Fauci’s involvement in funding gain of function research with coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, appeared vindicated in an interview Thursday following disturbing revelations from released emails, which Paul urged should be the final nail in Fauci’s coffin.







Speaking to Laura Ingraham, Paul asserted that “The emails paint a disturbing picture, a disturbing picture of Dr. Fauci, from the very beginning, worrying that he had been funding gain-of-function research. He knows it to this day, but hasn’t admitted it.”

                    <span>22.4 Down, 14.7 Up, 7.6 To Go: &quot;The Fed Faces A Difficult Decision&quot;

            
After today’s mixed US payrolls report, today’s Chart of the Day from DB&#x27;s Jim Reid shows we are still 7.6 million jobs away from where we were when the pandemic hit. 


We lost 22.4 million in the first 2 months and have gained 14.7 million over the last 13 months. 2021 has &quot;only&quot; seen an average monthly payrolls increase of 478k though May.







And while some saw only disappointment in the May jobs data, it was a truly Goldilocks report: as Reid says, &quot;there was clearly something for everyone in the report. The Fed will continue to suggest they are a long way from their employment goals and the inflationists will cite the higher earnings in the release as evidence that it&#x27;s hard to find employees at the right price.&quot;


Meanwhile, according to BofA, the report leaves the Fed &quot;to remain patient, slowly and carefully taking baby steps to set the stage for tapering but unlikely to send an explicit signal until the September FOMC meeting.&quot;


Maybe, Reid asks, you can have a relatively slow jobs recovery and inflation.



&quot;If that does happen then the Fed will have difficult decisions to make at some point.&quot; 



On that, the DB strategist concludes that &quot;next week&#x27;s US CPI will be the most watched economic report of the year so far.&quot;

Real Vision editors Max Wiethe and Jack Farley make sense of a truly odd week, one that began with the reappearance of memestock mania and ended with the S&amp;P 500 flirting with all-time highs (and with the VIX very close to a pre-pandemic low). Farley and Wiethe cover today’s strong rally in stocks as well as bonds, on the release of the U.S. non-farm payrolls data which missed economist expectations. Farley inspects Bill Ackman’s latest plans to acquire a slice of Universal Music Group via his SPAC, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings ($PSTH), and Wiethe looks forward to next week’s Fed meeting and release of the latest inflation data.

Authored by MN Gordon via EconomicPrism.com,


Jerome Powell might be done as a useful Federal Reserve Chairman.  Not that Fed Chairs provide a use that’s of any real value.  They mainly excel at destroying the wealth of wage earners and savers for the benefit of member banks.


But as Powell loses a grip on price inflation the business of supplying credit at a fixed rate of return becomes less fruitful.  Consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), is rising at an annual rate of 4.2 percent.  That’s well above interest rate of a 30 year fixed mortgage, which is currently 3.1 percent.


It doesn’t take much imagination to foresee a CPI over 6 percent.  At that rate of price inflation, what good t…</span>

Despite objections from government scientists and prominent businessmen, Japan is planning to move ahead with the postponed 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo next month. In an interview with the Japanese press, the president of the 2020 Games, Seiko Hashimoto, declared that the games would move ahead as planned, with the Japanese government taking certain precautions to prevent an outbreak of mutant COVID. 







&quot;We cannot postpone again,&quot; Hashimoto told the Nikkan Sports newspaper via Reuters.

The COVID-19 epidemic in Guangdong province continues to worsen. The Epoch Times has learned that one of the busiest commercial streets in the mega city of Shenzhen has just been closed due to infection. Meanwhile, in the provincial capital of Guangzhou city, food and medicine shortages have been reported in locked down areas.

In the US, the first winners of the &quot;vaccination lotteries&quot; being adopted by a growing number of states - including West Virginia (which is offering guns, trucks &amp; &quot;piles of cash), California and a handful of others - are taking home life-changing money, all because they decided to get vaccinated.







And according to WSJ, the incentives that these programs create are already having a positive impact on the vaccination rate, which has finally eclipsed 50% of American adults. The program is also having some success in Hong Kong.

A proposed Chinese wind farm in Texas poses national security concerns, warned China-watcher and hedge fund manager Kyle Bass.







The Blue Hills Wind development in southwest Texas’s Val Verde County has attracted heightened scrutiny in recent months, with lawmakers and experts signaling concern that the Chinese project could be used as a cover for espionage and to disrupt the state’s power grid.


The proposed wind farm site is about 30 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border and near the Laughlin Air Force Base, the U.S. Air Force’s largest pilot training facility.


The land for the wind farm is owned by a Chinese company called…</span>

Bill Ackman&#x27;s massive SPAC is reportedly nearing a transaction to take public Universal Music Group, the world’s largest music business, at a valuation of about $40 billion, the WSJ reported citing sources.


Back in July, Ackman’s special purpose acquisition company, called Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd., raised $4 billion in an initial public offering - a record amount for a SPAC to this day, as Ackman said that his firm was on the hunt for a “mature unicorn&quot;:

Authored by Glenn Greenwald via greenwald.substack.com,


One of the most significant events of the last two decades has been largely memory-holed: the October, 2001 anthrax attacks in the U.S. Beginning just one week after 9/11 and extending for another three weeks, a highly weaponized and sophisticated strain of anthrax had been sent around the country through the U.S. Postal Service addressed to some of the country&#x27;s most prominent political and media figures. As Americans were still reeling from the devastation of 9/11, the anthrax killed five Americans and sickened another seventeen.

With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu engaged in desperate 11th hour scrambling to try and pick off enough lawmakers on the right-wing to deny a power-sharing government under an unlikely coalition formed by Yamina leader Naftali Bennett, Yesh Atid head Yair Lapid and Ra&#x27;am (United Arab List) chairman Mansour Abbas - Iran has taken a moment to mock Israel&#x27;s longest serving prime minister as he&#x27;s on his way out.

During America’s first-ever national lockdown, thousands of unelected bureaucrats, as well as federal and state governments, assumed enormous powers not usually accorded to them.







They picked and chose which businesses could stay open without much rationale. They sent the infected into nursing homes occupied by the weak and vulnerable.


Their rules for prosecuting those who violated social distancing, sheltering in place, mask wearing or violent protesting often hinged on political grounds. Their spending measures on “infrastructure” and “health care” were excuses to lard up redistributive entitlements.

Think wage wars are only taking place among minimum wage workers, who (until September at least) are getting paid more from Uncle Sam to stay home and do nothing? Think again.


Amid numerous anecdotes of sticky wages at the high-end of the jobs spectrum, one stands out: as Bloomberg reports today, in September 2020, the Palo Alto-based Cooley law firm announced it was handing out $2,500 to $7,500 in one-time payments to associates. The bonuses came as the firm -  along with many others in the legal industry - realized it was both flush with cash and facing worker burnout during the pandemic.

Electric cars giant Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) said it expects to soon begin buying more than $1 billion a year of Australian lithium, nickel and other critical minerals for its batteries and engines. Chairman Robyn Denholm said the country has taken important steps towards cleaning its image of polluting commodities exporter and it is poised to become a globally significant supplier of climate change solutions.


“Australia has the minerals to power the renewable energy age throughout the world in the coming years,” Denholm, an Australian, said in a speech during a Minerals Council of Australia event.

This will hardly come as a surprise to anyone who followed the manic reddit-driven action over the past 48 hours: according to Goldman&#x27;s Prime Brokerage, we just witnessed the &quot;largest US single stock short covering since mid-March amid a sharp rally in High Retail Sentiment stocks&quot; and while US stocks saw modest net buying yesterday, it was driven by risk-off flows &quot;with short covers outpacing long sales 3 to 1.&quot;


The catalyst is well known: a furious, face-ripper of a rally in the heavily-shorted meme stocks, which pushed the Goldman Retail Sentiment Basket, (GSCBHTBR) i.e., the retail favorite stocks up +25% yesterday and up +61% over the last 7 sessions!

Isn’t is amazing how quickly things seem to change when it’s in the interest of those that think they run the world? For years we’ve been trying to get access to Hillary Clinton’s missing e-mails as Secretary of State but to no avail. However, at the most opportune time in the collapsing COVID story, Dr. Anthony Fauci’s emails are uncovered and broadcast to the world.


The same mechanism, FOIA, that Hillary has stonewalled us on for six years uncovers Fauci’s emails in six weeks?







Doesn’t that strike you as just the slightest bit odd?

Someone should put Elon Musk on notice: the legacy automakers have officially entered the EV sales fray.


And domestic U.S. automakers have officially hit the ground running.


Ford announced on Thursday that U.S. sales were up 4.1% to 161,725 units in May, while YTD sales were up 11.3%. The &quot;everything bubble&quot; created by Central Banks helped truck sales rise 11.6% over the same period and SUV sales to rise 48.6%. These numbers were despite the auto industry continuing to grapple with a semiconductor shortage - one that had even left Ford trucks stranded on the side of the road, waiting for parts, earlier this year. 


But the standout in Ford&#x27;s report? EV sales were up 184% to 10,364 units. The company al…</span>

                    <span>Biden Signals &#x27;Major Changes&#x27; To Tax Proposal To Win GOP Support

            
It appears the Biden administration has realized their ambitious tax hikes have a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell of passing, given the slim majority Democrats hold in both chambers of Congress - which include two serious moderates (Manchin and Sinema) and a parliamentarian who won&#x27;t let them get away with forcing legislation through via reconciliation (a simple majority).


Now, according to the Washington Post, Biden has outlined a plan for $1 trillion in new spending financed through tax changes which would not focus on raising the top corporate rate - a major concession to Republicans who opposed an earlier proposal to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


For about 1 in 4, Social Security provides at least 90 percent of their income.


How many retired workers are getting less than $1,000 per month in Social Security benefits? The question came up and I was curious enough to find the answer, and download the data into an Excel spreadsheet which I saved as a PDF that you can review here. Note that this data is for the 46.5 million retired workers only, and does not include benefits paid to survivors, spouses, disabled, etc.


This led to a deep dive into the basic numbers of Social Security beneficiaries and expenses, which are summarized in the chart below. Here are the basics:

Update (1650ET): It appears former President Trump has read a few more of Fauci&#x27;s real ouchies exposed by the FOIA-driven email extravaganza and he doesn&#x27;t like what he&#x27;s reading.


In a statement released via NewsMax&#x27;s Steve Cortes, Trump demands reparations from China for unleashing hell on the world...



Now everyone, even the so-called &quot;enemy&quot;, are beginning to say that President Trump was right about the China Virus coming from the Wuhan Lab.


The correspondence between Dr. Fauci and China speaks too loudly for anyone to ignore.


China should pay Ten Trillion Dollars to America, and the World, for the death and destruction they have caused!

Titled &quot;If I Were a Jew,&quot; Bobb wrote: &quot;If I were a Jew I would be concerned about my insatiable appetite for war and killing in defense of myself.&quot;

A dangerous heatwave plagues much of the Western US this week as scorching heat pushes towards the east through the weekend and into early next week. 


Heat warnings and advisories are in effect from the California/Mexico border to Washington state, where temperatures anomalies are 30 degrees above normal in some areas. 


&quot;Extreme heat in these locations will significantly increase the potential for heat-related illnesses,&quot; the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) warned. 


&quot;Additionally, much of the Southwest and West is experiencing severe to exceptional drought conditions, which will undoubtedly be exacerbated by the current heatwave,&quot; added WPC.

By Vince Bielski, RealClearInvestigations


President Biden repeatedly insists that his infrastructure plan will create millions of jobs and labor unions will be the big winners. But interviews with economists, union leaders, government officials and trade groups as well as basic math suggest otherwise.


The once dominant trade and construction unions no longer have enough members outside of their strongholds on both coasts and in the Midwest to claim most of the projected infrastructure jobs. By some estimates, two-thirds of these jobs will go to nonunion workers who dominate the construction markets in most states.


Biden, in short, appears to be harking back nostalgically to an era of union…</span>

Since its inception in March of 2016, the Babylon Bee has made a name for itself as the most hilarious satire website in the known universe - cranking out headlines that would fool only the most abject of morons with no inner monologue, while making the rest of us spit coffee all over our screens.

As the site has risen in popularity (with an estimated 5 million visits per month), liberal &#x27;fact checkers&#x27; began smearing the Bee by fact checking obvious satire.

Pouring more fuel on what was already today&#x27;s dumpster fire of a market, Bloomberg reported that according to a memo it had seen, Jefferies told clients its prime brokerage arm will no longer allow the execution of short sells in meme stocks such as AMC, GameStop and MicroVision.


“Until further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options in GME, AMC and MVIS,” the memo noted. The firm will no longer allow the execution of short sells of those securities, the memo continued, noting that other stocks may be added to that list.


The news comes in a rollercoaster session for AMC which after plunging as much as 30% on news it was selling 11.55MM shares in an At The Market offering, reversed all losses after announcing it had completed the offering, gaining as much as 10% before again reversing the move and last seen down about 9% at $57. Expect much more drama here.

By Greg Miller of American Shipper,


In a sign of just how frenzied the container market has become, a freight forwarder is reportedly paying $135,000 per day for a short-term charter of the S Santiago, a 15-year-old container ship with a capacity of 5,060 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).



“Charter rates for short employment … have gone out of control,” said Alphaliner in its new weekly report.



“Depending on the sources, the ship would have obtained anything between $100,000 and $145,000 per day, an absolute historic high. The name of the charterer has not been fully confirmed, although it is believed to be a forwarder.”

                    <span>New York City Paid 114,000 Highly-Compensated Public Employees Earning $100,000+

            
Authored by Adam Andrzejewski via RealClear Policy (emphasis ours),


New York City had more than 114,000 municipal workers earning $100,000 or more in 2019. That is up sharply from 76,166 employees with pay exceeding $100,000 in 2016.







Data comes a year before the pandemic hit and is the latest year available.


These were not just high-level employees like agency commissioners or deputy mayors. NYC employees included thermostat repairmen making up to $198,630; regular laborers hauling away $213,169; electricians taking home $253,132; and plumbers pocketing up to $286,245.


The cost of benefits would be additional and is not included in these figures.


These large paychecks are only sustainable because Congress bailed out New York City for $4.3 billion in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The federal bailout more than covered the overstated deficits of the city.


City officials estimated a $5.5 billion gap, but actual revenues came in $2.7 billion higher. Using $1.2 billion from reserves, and finding $1 billion in unspecified labor savings, among other things closed the budget gap.


Therefore, the federal money now exists for extra spending.


In December, Fitch Ratings downgraded New York City’s bond rating and issued a negative outlook. That was after Moody’s Investors Service lowered the credit ratings of both the state and city in October.

Authored by Caitlin Johnstone via Medium.com,


I’ve been learning as much as I can about the new UFO narrative the political/media class have been pushing in conjunction with the US military to prepare for the Senate report that’s due to be released this month.


One of the disconcerting things I’ve been seeing again and again from all the major players in this new narrative like Lue Elizondo and Christopher Mellon is the absurd assertion that not only is it entirely possible that the unknown phenomena allegedly being regularly witnessed by military personnel are extraterrestrial in origin, but that if they are extraterrestrial they may want to hurt us.

                    <span>Landlords Hosed After Appeals Court Tosses Bid To Resume Evictions

            
Landlords across the country, the least-pitied group of Americans, were handed a loss on Wednesday after  a federal appeals court in Washington DC denied a request to resume evictions amid a contentious dispute over a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) moratorium during the pandemic.







To recap, last month US District Judge Dabney Friedrich struck down the CDC moratorium on evictions, finding that the agency had overstepped its authority - yet agreeing to block her own ruling from taking immediate affect in order for the Biden administration to launch an appeal, according to The Hill.


In response, the plaintiffs - which includes the Alabama Association of Realtors and several co-plaintiffs - aske…</span>

Authored by Andy Puzder via RealClearPolitics.com, 


In a speech last week introducing his proposed $6 trillion 2022 budget, President Biden claimed that the benefits of the Republican Party’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act “went to the wealthiest 1% of America.”


It’s not the first time he’s made this claim.


In his first speech to a joint session of Congress, Biden described the TCJA as a “huge windfall” for “those at the very top.” 


To right that wrong, he proposes getting rid of loopholes and raising the top tax rate from its current 37% to 39.6%.


Why? So that “the wealthiest 1% of Americans” will “pay their fair share,” a phrase that the president and his fellow Democrats repeat with abandon.  







But there’s a big problem with B…</span>

                    <span>SoftBank-Backed Construction-Industry-&quot;Transforming&quot; Company Katerra Collapses After Billions In Investment

            
Oh how the mighty continue to fall.


Katerra, the construction giant that was backed by SoftBank, has officially told its employees that it is shutting down its operations. Katerra “had promised to shake up the construction industry with its efficient factories, prefab parts and modular construction units,” Bloomberg had reported on the company in the past.


But now the only thing it&#x27;s shaking up are the lives of the 8,000 employees it had globally, as of last year, according to TechCrunch, who pointed out that the company had already struggled &quot;to find a viable business in cheaply building properties for real estate developers&quot;.


The company was then beset by climbing labor and material costs associated with the pandemic (and perhaps now, the hyperinflation that&#x27;s succeeding the pandemic). 


&quot;So, you guys use a lot of lumber, or no?&quot;


SoftBank tried to bail out the struggling company, offering $200 million on top of the billions it had already invested in the company, to buy a majority stake. But, not unlike the WeWork IPO, Katerra couldn&#x27;t be saved. 


Bloomberg reports that the company is now likely going to walk away from &quot;dozens&quot; of projects it has already committed to. 


Among those being laid off are 117 workers in Seattle, according to The Seattle Times. The losses are expected to take effect on June 4. 


CEO Masayoshi Son had called Katerra one of his &quot;regrets&quot; in an interview with Barron&#x27;s last month. The company had raised more than $2 billion since its founding in 2015.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


A report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned that a recent labor shortage plaguing businesses nationwide is worsening, describing the situation as a “national economic crisis.”







The Chamber’s report released Tuesday found that the United States had a record 8.1 million vacant job openings in March—the last month where data was available—noting it was an increase of 600,000 from February.


But, the Chamber stressed that there “are approximately half as many available workers for every open job,” or 1.4 available workers per job opening, across the country “and the ratio continues to fall.” Compared with the previous 20 years, the…</span>

How big is Biden&#x27;s $6 trillion budget and what are the admitted implications?







That seemingly simple question is the subject of a scathing attack on Biden by the Washington Post.


WaPo Columnist Marc A. Thiessen says Biden’s Budget is a Lie.



Q: How big a lie? 

A: Another $5.8 trillion.



Thiessen calculates that by adding up all of Biden&#x27;s campaign promises and items in the budget that are not reasonable estimates. 


 Missing in Action 




	
Biden&#x27;s plan to create a “public option” for health care and lower the age at which Americans can receive Medicare, is nowhere to be.  According to Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Ri…</span>

                    <span>&quot;Expect the Unexpected&quot; Indeed - Fauci&#x27;s Pandemic-Profiteering Book Was Just Pulled From Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble

            
Following revelations of rampant malarkey and doublespeak from Dr. Anthony Fauci - the nation&#x27;s highest-paid government employee - Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble appear to have &#x27;canceled&#x27; the top virologist&#x27;s upcoming book amid criticism that he&#x27;s profiting from the COVID-19 pandemic - the tone-deaf response to which he played a significant role in, according to Just The News.

                    <span>Bibi Finally Out As &quot;Change Coalition&quot; Moves Fast On Knesset Approval

            
It&#x27;s official: just before midnight local time Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid of Yesh Atid party notified President Reuven Rivlin that he&#x27;s successfully formed a power-sharing government, which means the country&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is out.


The 71-year-old Netanyahu has long been dubbed &quot;the magician&quot; by supporters for his history of being able to politically survive time and again against multiple near-misses. But as Axios notes, &quot;But he&#x27;s not out quite yet&quot; - and there&#x27;s still time to wreak havoc on Iran in a desperate bid to cancel the nuclear deal with world powers.

Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


On Tuesday, the new head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency suggested more Israeli covert attacks and assassinations inside Iran should be expected even as the US and other world powers are negotiating a revival of the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA.


&quot;The Iranian program will continue feeling Mossad’s might. We are well acquainted with the nuclear program and its various components, we know personally the factors that operate in it and also the forces that drive them,&quot; David Barnea said at his swearing-in ceremony, as quoted by Israel’s Ynet.







Barnea said the JCPOA negotiations show that Israel might have to act alone against Iran. &quot;The agree…</span>

                    <span>Step Aside AMC: Here Are The Most Shorted Stocks Right Now

            
Four months after the Reddit crew sparked a historic market-wide short squeeze across a handful of small and mid-cap companies, which knocked out some of the most respected hedge funds in the world with Melvin Capital requiring a multi-billion bailout from Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen, the squeeze is back sending heavily shorted names like AMC, whose short interest we pointed out last week was off the charts...

— zerohedge (@zerohedge) May 25, 2021


... and which has exploded higher, a squeeze which has now shifted over to names such as Bed Bath and Beyond and various other small and mid-cap names.







Of course, there is no mystery what&#x27;s behind this: just like in late January when the meme squeeze phenomenon first emerged, the common theme here is that all these stocks are extremely heavily shorted, and retail investors are seeking to squeeze the shorts once again and thus time with even more stimmy power.


To be sure, one look at the chart of the most heavily shorted names shows what&#x27;s going on.







So, just like in late January, we have compiled a list of the most heavily shorted names. It may come as a surprise to some that the former leaders here, GME and AMC are not even in the top 30.


So which companies are? Below we have screened for the most shorted Russell 2000 names (based on SI as a % of float), and which we will use to constitute our latest and greatest short basket.







If the performance of our previous most shorted index is any indication, going long a market cap-weighted basket of these names - and especially the smaller, less liquid ones - could turn out to be the trade of the year, if not a lifetime.

We have a pretty good idea of what&#x27;s behind the latest reddit meltup.


Unlike the March and April, when hedge funds remained largely inert on a net basis, still smarting from the bruising their short books suffered during the January and February meme stock meltups, May saw a renewed push to short beaten down names, with Goldman&#x27;s Prime Brokerage reporting that its book was net sold for a second straight month, driven by short sales outpacing long buys 1.3 to 1.

&quot;China Joe&quot; Biden has entered the chat.


President Biden is preparing to amend a sweeping US ban on trading with Chinese firms with connections to the PLA, China&#x27;s military, after the policy, initially proposed by President Trump, was challenged in court.


According to Bloomberg, under Biden’s amended order, the Treasury Department will create a list of companies that could face financial penalties for their connection to China’s defense and surveillance technology sectors, the people said.  Previously, the nature of the financial sanctions and the specific companies targeted were set via a Congressionally mandated report from the Pentagon.

The Fed’s first-ever foray into directly bailing out the corporate bond market will apparently come to a final close in the next few months (they hope).







The vehicle, known as the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, or SMCCF, holds about $13.7 billion in already-outstanding corporate bonds.


The SMCCF ceased operations on December 31, 2020.


$5.21 billion of bonds from individual companies including Whirlpool, Walmart, and Visa (as of April 30, 2021, 45 bonds matured, 112 had been redeemed early, and 1,204 bonds remain outstanding in the SMCCF).

                    <span>Oil Algos Confused After Big Crude Draw, Product Build

            
Oil prices rallied on the day as signs of a demand recovery from the US to Europe stoke optimism among producers and analysts in the crude market, combined with waning hopes for an Iran nuke deal.


Oil is in “strong demand right now,” with economies around the world opening up, Daniel Yergin, the oil historian and vice chairman at consultant IHS Markit Ltd., said in a Bloomberg Television interview.



&quot;Oil is bid on the Iran timeline to adding barrels getting kicked further into the future--sometime between August and the fall,&quot; says Bob Yawger at Mizuho.



After last week&#x27;s across-the-board draws, analysts expected another week of demand dominance.

WTI hovered just below $68.80 ahead of the API print and barely budged on the mixed data...







“There’s plenty of room for upside here,” said Bob Yawger, head of the futures division at Mizuho Securities.


“Summer and the reopening of the economy is bullish for demand,” while “it looks much less likely we’ll have Iranian barrels any time soon than it did last week.”


But, the question now is whether oil prices can hold their gains &quot;amid strong demand, despite plenty of downside risk on the supply side,&quot; said Robbie Fraser, global research &amp; analytics manager at Schneider Electric, in a daily report.

The Department of Homeland Security on Friday issued a new warning bulletin, alerting Americans that domestic extremists may well use violence on the 100th Anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre. This was at least the fourth such bulletin issued this year by Homeland Security (DHS) warning of the same danger and, thus far, none of the fears it is trying to instill into the American population has materialized.

According to every career economist, market strategist and Fed lackey, inflation is transitory. The most important man on Wall Street disagrees.


Speaking at a virtual event hosted by Deutsche Bank, Blackrock CEO Larry Fink who manages more money than the Fed (over $9 trillion at last check) countered soothing talk that soaring prices are here and gone tomorrow, and said that investors may be underestimating the potential for a spike in inflation.



&quot;Most people haven’t had a forty-plus year career, and they’ve only seen declining inflation over the last 30-plus years. So this is going to be a pretty big shock&quot;, Fink said, his warning falling on deaf ears.

Authored by Daniel Lacalle,


The first thing any economist should do wen reading a budget proposal is to analyse the basic macro assumptions and the results presented by the administration. When both are poor, the budget should be criticised. This is the case of the Biden Budget Plan.







Same growth, a lot more debt and less employment.


According to the administration, the impact on growth of this budget will be negligible, as their own -and optimistic- estimates see no change in the slowdown of the U.S. economic growth trend.

                    <span>Iran Says Nuclear Negotiators Close To Agreement - Remaining Barriers &quot;Not Unsolvable&quot; 

            
Iran now says that remaining contested issues between it and the United States are &quot;not unsolvable&quot; and that all parties appear in agreement on this point at a moment the latest round of talks in Vienna are wrapping up. The Islamic Republic&#x27;s deputy foreign minister and chief negotiator Abbas Araghchi told state TV on Wednesday that of nuclear issues which remain, presumably including the dropping of US sanctions, they &quot;have reached a point where everyone believes that they’re not unsolvable.&quot;


&quot;All the delegations are determined and there is full seriousness&quot; he added, while also noting Wednesday&#x27;s meeting will decide a &quot;return date&quot; for talks, also as after last week it was widely r…</span>

Authored by Jamie Joseph via The Epoch Times,


Los Angeles is set ablaze up to 24 times a day. The cause? Thousands of homeless encampments...







This year, fires started in homeless encampments have accounted for 54 percent of the blazes battled by the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), according to officials—a sharp uptick compared to 2020.


As the county grapples with more than 66,000 people living on its streets, critics are pointing to the growing number of fires caused by the homeless as another indication that officials are mishandling the crisis. And in parts of the city where the homeless are concentrated, residents and business owners say their concerns are not being heard.

U.S. troops tasked with guarding nuclear bombs in Europe accidentally leaked highly sensitive information about these weapons on popular educational websites, according to Bellingcat.


Military personnel used popular learning websites such as Quizlet, Chegg Prep, and Cram to remember complex security protocols, exact locations, and other top-secret information. 


So how did Bellingcat&#x27;s Foeke Postma uncover the leaked documents? Well, a simple search on the study websites revealed various sets of flashcards.

Authored by Lawrence Kadish via The Gatestone Institute,


One suspects that historians and economists will consistently agree on one irrefutable fact: nations that allow their economies to bathe in red ink are destined to fail. This failure takes many roads and differs in timing, but massive, uncontrolled national deficits eventually reduce a nation state to being a pauper, a pariah -- and pathetic.


Enter Joe Biden&#x27;s &quot;American Jobs Plan,&quot; a $2.3 trillion spending scheme that takes some Americans&#x27; most fevered fantasies and wraps them inside an &quot;infrastructure&quot; label in an effort to convince Capitol Hill that the spending is all about roads and bridges.

After receiving more than 75,000 individual complaints that it&#x27;s Alex-powered Echo devices were spying on them, Amazon has abandoned its policy that such complaints must be resolved outside the court system via secretive arbitration proceedings, and will instead allow customers to file lawsuits, according to the Wall Street Journal.


In other words, &#x27;so sue us.&#x27;







The company quietly changed its terms of service to file lawsuits, as the company already faces at least three class action suits - including one brought May 18 alleging that the company&#x27;s Echo devices were recording people without permission. 



The retail giant made the change after plaintiffs’ lawyers flooded Amazon wit…</span>

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


A man in eastern China contracted what appears to be the first human case of H10N3, a type of avian influenza, according to Chinese regime officials.







The 41-year-old man, who was not named, was hospitalized in late April with H10N3 in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, located near Shanghai, according to China’s National Health Commission in a statement on its website.


The commission said that no other cases have been reported.



“This infection is an accidental cross-species transmission,” its statement said, while also claiming that “the risk of large-scale transmission is low,” according to a Chinese-to-English translation.

The Biden administration has scrapped FBI background checks for caregivers at its overpacked child migrant shelters (or as AOC no longer calls them, &#x27;concentration camps&#x27;), alarming child welfare experts who say this compromises safety, according to the Chicago Tribune.







The move comes as Biden turns to &quot;tent camps, convention centers and other huge facilities&quot; which are operated by private contractors paid by the Department of Health and Human Services. In March, the administration announced that it would open eight new emergency sites across the Southwest, which will add 15,000 new beds - doubling capacity.

                    <span>Fauci Emails Reveal Damage Control Scramble After ZeroHedge Spotlights Man-Made COVID-19 Theory

            
In January, 2020, when the World Health Organization insisted that COVID-19 wasn&#x27;t transmissible between humans, and Dr. Anthony Fauci said that the risk to the American public from the virus was &quot;low,&quot; officials at the National Institutes of Health were scrambling to perform damage control after a controversial - and now withdrawn - study suggested that there were HIV-like &#x27;insertions&#x27; included in SARS-CoV-2.







The study, &quot;Uncanny similarity of unique inserts on the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag,&quot; posited that segments of the virus&#x27;s RNA had no relation to other coronaviruses such as SARS, and instead appeared to be closer to HIV.

Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,


You probably don’t need me to tell you that society is coming apart at the seams all around us.  If you live in a major city, you can just walk outside and watch it happen right in front of you.  Prior to 2020, social decay was steadily eating away at our society, but once the pandemic hit many of our societal problems greatly accelerated.  Even while the Federal Reserve was making sure that wealthy Wall Street investors were being taken care of well, poverty and homelessness were absolutely exploding in major cities all over the nation.  Meanwhile, an increasing number of Americans have been turning to drugs to cope with thei…</span>

Update (2002 ET): The USDA has released an important update about the Biden administration&#x27;s steps to mitigate potential supply constraints and price surges following JBS&#x27; ransomware attack. 



As noted earlier today by the White House, USDA is aware of the ransomware attack against JBS, which is affecting the company&#x27;s operations, including its facilities in the United States. USDA continues to work closely with the White House, Department of Homeland Security, JBS USA and others to monitor this situation closely and offer help and assistance to mitigate any potential supply or price issues. As part of that effort, USDA has reached out to several major meat processors in the United States to …</span>

Longtime &#x27;bond king&#x27; Bill Gross has kept a low profile since his &quot;retirement&quot; from Janus Henderson, where he worked after leaving PIMCO abruptly in 2014 in a high-profile dispute with colleagues. While he emerged earlier this year to share the results of a recent Gamestop short, Gross has been making more appearances in the tabloids than in the business press recently thanks to a legal dispute with one of his neighbors.







But in today&#x27;s FT, Gross returns with an editorial warning that the Federal Reserve and Treasury are injecting money into the economy so quickly that as the economy recovers from COVID-19, they&#x27;re risking a dangerous snap-back in markets as investors reckon with the withdrawal of …</span>

                    <span>Tennessee Will Explore The Possibility Of A State Gold Depository

            
Via SchiffGold.com,


Last month, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed a bill into law that creates a commission to study the feasibility of creating a gold bullion depository in the Volunteer State.







A state bullion depository would not only create a safe place to store precious metals; it would increase the state’s financial independence. It could also facilitate the everyday use of gold and silver in financial transactions in Tennessee and set the stage to undermine the Federal Reserve’s monopoly on money.


Sen. Paul Rose (R) sponsored Senate Bill 279 (SB279) and Rep. Bud Hulsey (R-Kingsport) carried the companion bill in the House — House Bill 353 (HB353). The new law requires the Tennessee advis…</span>

                    <span>Huawei Challenges Google, Apple With New Smartphone Operating System

            
President Biden has decided to maintain President Trump&#x27;s blacklisting of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, cutting it off from key American suppliers and hamstringing its smartphone business, which was, for a brief time, the global leader in sales thanks to its leading position in China, by far the world&#x27;s biggest market. Now, after developing its own proprietary operating system and initially deploying it on laptops and tablets, the company is preparing to launch a mobile version of Harmony OS for smartphones in a bid to take on Google and Apple.

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


The Washington Post has become the latest media outlet to reverse its earlier insistence that the Wuhan lab leak theory was a “debunked conspiracy theory.”







The newspaper published an article in February 2020 by Paulini Firozi labeling the explanation a “debunked conspiracy theory” but has now been forced to issue a retraction.



“Earlier versions of this story and its headline inaccurately characterized comments by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) regarding the origins of the coronavirus,” states the retraction.

The mothers of several people whose names have been invoked by Black Lives Matter activists panned the group’s co-founder, Patrisse Cullors, for benefitting “off the blood” of their family members.







Cullors last week announced last week that she would be departing the organization, coming after reports disclosed her finances and real estate holdings.



“They are benefiting off the blood of our loved ones, and they won’t even talk to us,” Samaria Rice, the mother of a 12-year-old boy, Tamir Rice, who was shot by police in Cleveland, told the New York Post.

                    <span>SEC Blasted Tesla In May 2020 For Failing To Oversee Musk&#x27;s Tweets

            
In previously undisclosed documents, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, securities regulators told Tesla last year that CEO Elon Musk&#x27;s use of Twitter had twice violated a court-ordered policy requiring his tweets to be preapproved by company lawyers.







In letters sent to Tesla in 2019 and 2020, the SEC reportedly said tweets that Musk wrote about Tesla&#x27;s solar roof production volumes and its stock price hadn&#x27;t undergone the required preapproval by Tesla&#x27;s lawyers.


As a reminder, Musk had publicly mocked the SEC even after settling the previous fraud claims with the agency.







Specifically, The Wall Street Journal reports that the SEC told Tesla in May 2020 that:



the company had failed “to enforce these procedures and controls despite repeated violations by Mr. Musk.”



The letter, signed by a senior SEC official in its San Francisco office, added:



“Tesla has abdicated the duties required of it by the court’s order.”



This perhaps explains why Musk himself was quick to admit in May 2020 that &quot;no&quot;, his twitter remarks were not vetted.


Given the fact that we are just discovering these details now - at least 13 months after they occurred - as far as we can see, nothing at all has been done to either re-enforce the SEC-ordered oversight by Tesla lawyers, or to slow Musk&#x27;s roll in tweeting frequency and absurdity (cough Dogecoin cough)...



Is the SEC going to - wait for it - tell Tesla to preclear Musk&#x27;s tweets (again)?

...we can only imagine how long it will be before some actual actions are taken... or enforcements hardened over the carmaker&#x27;s incessant need to &#x27;share&#x27;.

By now, even the shoeshine boy knows that central banks are one-print trick pony farcical joke, one which is exposed not just by cryptos which have emerged as a clear alternative to fiat currencies, but by central banks themselves who are adopting their own digital currencies knowing well that the days of traditional paper money are numbered.


And yet within the giant Venn Diagram of the &quot;big farce&quot;, there is a smaller Venn Diagram, which is basically everything and anything Turkey-related, and whose farcical content is exponentially more concentrated because while central banks have become the laughing stock of the financial world in its twilight days before the upcoming grea…</span>

Amazon Sidewalk, the company&#x27;s new shared mesh network that helps devices like Amazon Echo devices, Ring Security Cams, outdoor lights, motion sensors, and Tile trackers work better around the house and beyond, will be switched on next week. Tens of millions of Americans own Amazon devices, and the experimental network will turn users into guinea pigs next week, according to ArsTechnica.


On June 8, users who don&#x27;t opt-out will be automatically enrolled in &quot;Sidewalk.&quot; The mesh network, created by Echoes, cameras, and other smart devices under the Amazon brand, will use a small amount of bandwidth and broadcast to nearby neighbors and or city streets.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


More than 100 employees at Houston Methodist Hospital filed a lawsuit against their employer for requiring all staff members to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in order to keep their jobs.







Saying the COVID-19 vaccines are experimental and they don’t want to be “guinea pigs,” the 117 employees argued in court that it’s unlawful for their employers to require them to take the shots.



“Methodist Hospital is forcing its employees to be human ‘guinea pigs’ as a condition for continued employment,” their lawsuit (pdf) states. They wrote that the hospital’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate “requires the employee to subject themselves to medical…</span>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who increasingly looks to be on his way out of power, said on Tuesday that&#x27;s he&#x27;s willing to worsen relations with the US under the Biden administration if it means preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.


&quot;An Iranian nuclear bomb is a threat for the continuation of the Zionist project and we must fight it relentlessly,&quot; he said at a ceremony on the occasion of Israel&#x27;s new Mossad chief David Barnea taking the helm. &quot;If we have to choose between friction with our great friend the U.S. and the elimination of this existential threat, the elimination of the threat will come first,&quot; Netanyahu asserted.

“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. …We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.

Once upon a time, not that long ago, the biggest outrage in the world of politics was the &quot;shocking&quot; revelation made possible by Edward Snowden&#x27;s exposure of the NSA&#x27;s deep state operations, that the Obama administration had a penchant for spying... on everyone, and especially its top allies such as Angela Merkel who BlackBerry was notorious breached by US spies (yes, even the ultra-partisan outlet CNN covered it &quot;Obama administration spied on German media as well as its government&quot;).


Of course, the outrage eventually died down with nothing changing - after all, the US deep state can and will spy on anyone and everyone it chooses, and it&#x27;s not like the president has any control over it, …</span>

                    <span>WHO Switches To Greek Letters To Name Most Dangerous COVID Mutants

            
In a decision that echos the WHO&#x27;s decision back in early 2020 to rename the novel coronavirus to &quot;COVID-19&quot;, the agency has decided to change the names of the most prominent mutant strains of the coronavirus to letters from the Greek alphabet.







Using letters like Alpha, Beta and Gamma (instead of B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) to refer to the variants will make it &quot;easier and more practical&quot; to discuss them with non-scientific audiences, the WHO said in a statement. COVID strains believed to be more infectious are deemed &quot;of interest&quot; and &quot;of concern&quot; by the WHO. 



&quot;While they have their advantages, these scientific names can be difficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting,&quot; the WHO …</span>

                    <span>A Margin Story: Fast Economic Growth Without Profits

            
By Joe Carson, former chief economist at Alliance Bernstein


In Q1 2021, the US economy registered double-digit annualized growth in nominal GDP, a rare occurrence. Yet, an even more rare event is that corporate operating profits did not increase in the quarter when GDP growth increased double-digits.


How can companies&#x27; operating earnings be flat when nominal growth is booming? How does the GDP measure of operating square with S&amp;P 500 firms reporting substantial gains in Q1, far exceeding analysts&#x27; estimates?


GDP Growth &amp; Operating Profits


The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported that nominal GDP increased at an annual rate of 11% in Q1 2021. Since the Reagan boom of the early 1980s, the US only regis…</span>

                    <span>Iran Warns Against &quot;Miscalculations&quot; As US Military Monitors Pair Of Venezuela-Bound Warships

            
In a seeming repeat of the Trump admin attempt to impose a full naval blockade on Venezuela to prevent fuel and oil imports and exports, especially involving Iranian tankers, the US military is said to be actively monitoring two Iranian naval vessels which are believed headed toward Venezuela.


Washington has reportedly warned the Maduro government against receiving the warships, which likely have elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force members aboard. The two &quot;rogue states&quot; (as the US sees them) have become increasingly close especially under the prior four Trump years as they cooperated in circumventing US sanctions, and have grown militarily more cooperative.

After Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) attempted to combat cartels through peaceful means - namely his &quot;hugs, not bullets&quot; campaign to appease criminal organizations, the notoriously violent Jalisco cartel responded by kidnapping several members of an elite police force in the state of Guanajuato, torturing them to obtain the names and addresses of other cops, and is now hunting them down and killing them at their own homes, &quot;on their days off, in front of their families,&quot; according to the Associated Press.

                    <span>Melbourne Lockdown May Be Extended As Latest COVID Cluster Rises To 51

            
Australia and New Zealand have managed to keep COVID cases and deaths at a minimum thanks largely to their isolated status, which has enabled both countries to &quot;raise the drawbridge&quot;, so to speak, keeping out most foreigners since the start of the crisis.







But even with Australia&#x27;s notoriously stringent COVID-19 restrictions, a few cases have managed to slip by. In the face of the biggest cluster uncovered in months, Melbourne and the surrounding Victoria State entered their 4th lockdown last week. Though it was only supposed to last a week, that could soon change as more cases are confirmed.

While there was far more than met the eye in Biden&#x27;s $6 trillion budget (released late on Friday ahead of the &quot;long weekend&quot; as if Joe desperately hoped nobody would read it as it pissed off both conservatives as well as socialists) as discussed last week his budget proposal to Congress did reveal what Goldman has called the &quot;most important number&quot; in the budget - it calls for an increase in the deficit of $800BN over 10 years (0.3% of GDP over that period) to accommodate his “American Jobs Plan” (AJP) and “American Families Plan”(AFP). While the amount is not surprising, according to Goldman this is the first time the White House has formally shown the net effect of their proposals over the ten-year period Congress will…</span>

                    <span>61-Year-Old Woman Living Near Wuhan Lab May Have Been &#x27;Patient Zero&#x27; - Three Weeks Before CCP Claims First Case

            
Three weeks before China admitted that a mysterious virus was circulating in the city of Wuhan, a 61-year-old woman who lived about a mile from several bat research facility was known as &quot;Patient Su&quot; at a local hospital, according to the Daily Mail.


Her identity was accidentally revealed after a leading Chinese official sent a screen-grab to a medical journal which partially revealed personal information, including the fact that she was admitted to the Rongjun Hospital in Wuhan, and &quot;almost certainly lived in the Kaile Guiyan community on Zhuodaoquan Street, about 600 metres from the medical centre.&quot;

By Noi Mahoney of FreightWaves,


Transporting goods in and out of Mexico can be a challenge for both experienced and new shippers or logistics professionals.


The border crossing in Laredo, Texas


U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is tasked with assessing all commercial or pedestrian traffic entering the United States by airplane, overland vehicle, ship or on foot. However, in Mexico, about 10 different organizations are tasked with implementing customs clearance, issuing permits and certificates of imports/exports and protecting the border, including the Mexican army, the Guardia Nacional and the federal Tax Administration Service (SAT).

Brace for more pessimistic news about the global semiconductor shortage...


Intel is now going on the record and doubling down on statements that its CEO made on 60 Minutes earlier this year, stating that it could take &quot;several years&quot; for the current supply shortage of semiconductors to be resolved. 


CEO Pat Gelsinger said that the pandemic-inspired &quot;work from home&quot; trend caused a &quot;cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors&quot;, according to Reuters. 


&quot;But while the industry has taken steps to address near term constraints it could still take a couple of years for the ecosystem to address shortages of foundry capacity, substrates and components,&quot; Gelsinger commented.

Authored by Isabel van Brugen via The Epoch Times,


Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the lead Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Sunday said it was “more likely than not” that COVID-19 originated from a lab accident, calling it the “worst cover-up in human history.”



“I do think it’s more likely than not it emerged out of the lab, most likely accidentally,” McCaul said during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.”


“Let me say, this is the worst cover-up in human history that we’ve seen resulting in 3.5 million deaths, creating economic devastation around the globe.”

It&#x27;s not like we didn&#x27;t tell you so... 


The introduction of COVID status certificates is creating a two-tier society whereby vaxxed people enjoy their full rights and other perks, and non-vaxxed are heavily penalized.  


The latest example is in Florida, where a concert promoter for a future rock show this summer in Tampa Bay charges $18 per ticket for vaxxed fans and $999.99 for non-vaxxed fans, according to Tampa ABC affiliate WFTS.

                    <span>Memorial Day: Remember Political Lies That Caused Soldiers To Die

            
Authored by James Bovard via JimBovard.com,


On Memorial Day, the media do their usual sacralizing of war. Instead, it should be a day for the ritualized scourging of politicians.


During the last 70 years, their lies have resulted in the unnecessary deaths of almost 100,000 American soldiers and millions of foreigners. And yet, people still get teary-eyed when politicians take the stage to talk about their devotion to the troops.







On Memorial Day 2011, for instance, the Washington Post included numerous touching photographs of graves, recent widows or fatherless kids by the headstones, and stories of the troops’ sacrifices. The Post buried a short article in the middle of the A-Section (squee…</span>

                    <span>Michael Flynn Says Myanmar-Style Military Coup &#x27;Should Happen&#x27; In United States

            
Former Trump National Security Adviser Micheal Flynn made an off-the-cuff statement over the weekend that a Myanmar-like military coup not only could happen, but &quot;should happen&quot; in the US.







Speaking at the Dallas &quot;For God &amp; Country Patriot Roundup,&quot; branded by Business Insider and MarketWatch as a &quot;QAnon conference&quot; (because a quilt with a &quot;Q&quot; on it was auctioned off at the event), Flynn was asked during a Q&amp;A session &quot;I want to know why what happened in Myanmar can’t happen here?&quot;


To which Flynn - who spent 33 years as an Army intelligence officer - replied: &quot;No reason. I mean, it should happen.&quot;

After it was revealed that the FBI pressured Flynn into pleading guilty amid threat of going after his son, leading the DOJ to drop its case against him (which a judge finally closed eight months later), Flynn has become an icon among former President Trump&#x27;s most ardent supporters.


According to the New York Times, &quot;He was one of the most extreme voices in Mr. Trump’s 77-day push to overturn the election,&quot; and suggested using the military to rerun the vote in key battleground states - which then-President Trump could have imposed martial law to enact.


&quot;People out there talk about martial law like it’s something that we’ve never done,&quot; Flynn told Newsmax several months ago, noting that the military had taken over for civilian authorities dozens of times in US history.

The Elephant in the Room


Since we now know the extreme monetary policy implemented by the Americans is actually less extreme when compared to the Japanese, the Europeans, the Chinese, the Canadians and others, then there must be something else happening to create all of this (nonsensical) drama about the US Dollar being on the verge of collapsing.


And this is where the reflation trade comes into play. Monetary theorists have always proclaimed that if you produce excessive stimulus via interest rate cuts, balance sheet expansion and especially when combined with excessive stimulus, then inflation is going t…</span>

                    <span>China Orders First Lockdown Since January As Indian Mutant Discovered In Guangzhou

            
India&#x27;s second coronavirus wave finally crested during the month of May as the 7-day average declined steadily over the course of the month, while deaths remained stubbornly high until the second half. But even more than the numbers, the spread of a mutated COVID strain first discovered in India, a strain tagged with the handle B.1.617, has raised alarm as it spread around the world.







And now China is reacting to evidence of a recent cluster of cases caused by the Indian variant to further tighten China&#x27;s border between India and their mutual neighbors.

Moscow had some stinging words for Washington which were also hilariously ironic on Monday, as both Putin and Biden look ahead to their in-person summit set for June 16 in Geneva. Warning of &quot;uncomfortable&quot; signals to come, the Kremlin indicated that high on the agenda would be a range of human rights and free speech issues in the United States, particularly the &quot;persecution&quot; of those behind the January 6 Capitol riot by the Biden administration.

Local newspaper Yomiuri reveals Japanese authorities are mulling over expanding eligibility criteria, including a negative COVID-19 test or vaccination history, for fans before entering the Tokyo Olympics this summer. Once inside, spectators might be forbidden from eating, drinking, and cheering. 


Yomiuri said the government is considering that all spectators be required to show a negative COVID test within a week before attending the event that is set to run between July 23 and Aug. 8. 







Reuters quoted the government&#x27;s top spokesman Katsunobu Kato, who told reporters that he&#x27;s unaware of any decision on eligibility criteria.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Below is my column in the Hill newspaper on the announcement that the University of California will now join the “test-blind” movement and end the use of the SAT and ACT in its admissions decisions. Some have called for the change to increase diversity in the schools, particularly after California voters refused to change the long ban on affirmative action in education under state law.

Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has brought up a very interesting point regarding China&#x27;s unwillingness to share evidence with western investigators looking into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.


During a Sunday appearance on CBS News &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; Gottlieb noted that CCP scientists would have taken blood samples from three lab workers who were hospitalized with COVID-like symptoms in Dec. 2019 (one of whom&#x27;s wife likely died of the disease).







When asked if he believes whether the Chinese know where the pandemic came from, Gottlieb replied: &quot;They would know the answer to the question because they would have blood samples from the workers in that lab.&quot;…</span>

Different Types of Competition


With today being the US Memorial Day holiday to commemorate its fallen combat soldiers, it’s likely to be a quiet start to the week for markets. However, the US holiday provides a platform for some sober reflection on more contemporary forms of competition


First, a former PBOC official says the rapid rise in CNY against USD probably won’t last, and that the Chinese currency is “overbought”. That looks a further jaw-boning attempt to shift market expectations away from the idea that Beijing is going to allow CNY to keep appreciating.

                    <span>California Restaurant Owner Tacks On $5 Fee For Customers Who Refuse To Remove Masks

            
The owner of a Mendocino, California restaurant is penalizing customers who wear masks inside, according to NBC Bay Area.



&quot;$5 FEE ADDED TO ORDERS PLACED WHILE WEARING A FACE MASK,&quot; reads signs posted in the windows and at the register of Fiddleheads Cafe.



Fiddleheads Cafe in Mendocino not only discourages wearing masks but also charges a penalty. (May 28, 2021)


The fine print adds that anyone overheard bragging about having been vaccinated will be hit with another $5 charge.


&quot;Customers either love it or hate it,&quot; said owner Chris Castleman in an email to NBC Bay Area, who said the &#x27;fee&#x27; is ultimately considered an &#x27;optional donation&#x27; which goes to charities assisting vict…</span>

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Over the weekend Senator Rand Paul and former CIA director and secretary of state Mike Pompeo both warned that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is still up and running, and that evidence points to involvement with the Chinese military in bioweapons research.







Appearing on Fox News, Paul told Jeanine Pirro that he is worried US funding is still being used by the lab to conduct biological warfare experiments.



“I’m very worried that this stuff still goes on and that the U.S. government’s been funding it,” Paul said, adding “We’ve got a lot of evidence pointing to this lab now,” as the origin of the virus outbreak.

                    <span>&quot;Hostile Policy&quot; To Trigger Arms Race: N.Korea Blasts US Lifting Restrictions On South&#x27;s Missile Program

            
North Korea has blasted what it&#x27;s calling a &quot;hostile policy&quot; in the wake of the Biden White House lifting restrictions on South Korea&#x27;s ballistic missile program, which is now authorized to develop missiles capable of traveling beyond prior limitations. 


During a May 21 US-South Korea summit the US side announced Seoul is now free to pursue missiles with unlimited ranges, but the statement out of a Pyongyang official said this will inevitably lead to an &quot;acute and instable situation&quot;, according to the Associated Press. Previously the US imposed a limit of a 500 mile range (800km) on the south&#x27;s missiles on concerns of a regional arms race.

Authored by James Poplar via AmericanThinker.com,


Often, we forget that Memorial Day  is a day not for merchandise sales and or the unofficial start of Summer.







But rather it is a day set aside to honor those brave men and women who have fallen in the performance of their military duties while serving in the United States armed forces. 


On this solemn day there will be cemeteries all across the nation where loved ones will pay their humble respects and quiet tribute to a father, mother, sister, or brother. The loss may be fresh, or it may only be a distant but still painful memory. When I visit Arlington National Cemetery, I often see the tokens (flowers, stones, and photos) of remembrance left beh…</span>

                    <span>In Less Than Two Weeks, Millions Of Americans Will Lose Unemployment Benefits

            
With at least 24 GOP-led states set to end federal unemployment assistance before they&#x27;re set to expire on Sept. 6, million of Americans are going to need to dust off those resumes and start helping reduce the massive job shortage after being paid to stay home for over a year.







The benefits set to lapse include not only the additional $300 weekly federal supplement, but programs for gig workers and others who typically don&#x27;t qualify for aid &quot;(Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, or PUA) and for the long-term unemployed (Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, or PEUC) in most cases,&quot; according to CNBC, which has provided this handy guide to states set to end benefits, and when:

                    <span>The Worst-Kept Secret in America: High Inflation Is Back

            
Authored by Mark Hendrickson via The Mises Institute,


To most people, “inflation” signifies widespread rising prices. Economists have long argued, as a matter of technical accuracy, that “inflation” denotes an increasing money supply. Frankly, though, most people don’t care what happens to the supply of money, but they care a lot about the prices they pay, so I’ll focus primarily on the numerous rapidly rising prices Americans are paying today.







Following are several examples of the current inflation:


Corn, soybeans, and wheat have been trading at multi-year highs, with corn having risen from around $3.80 per bushel in January 2020 to approximately $6.75 now. Chicken wings are at all-time record high…</span>

                    <span>Belgium Recalls Ambassador To South Korea After Wife Attacked Workers

            
Belgium has recalled its ambassador to South Korea after his wife allegedly assaulted two employees of a shop in Seoul, an incident that elicited widespread public anger in South Korea.


According to the AP, the Belgian Embassy said Foreign Affairs Minister Sophie Wilmès had decided that it was in the best interest of bilateral relations to terminate Ambassador Peter Lescouhier&#x27;s tenure as Belgium&#x27;s ambassador to Seoul, a position he has held for three years. It&#x27;s been said that he will depart this summer, but an exact date hasn&#x27;t been released.







Although Lescouhier served his country with dedication, “the current situation doesn’t allow him to further carry out his role in a serene way,” the…</span>
