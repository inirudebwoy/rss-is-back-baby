The situation in the Seychelles, an island nation that has suffered from a recent surge in COVID-19 cases despite boasting the world's highest vaccination rate, is going from bad to worse.


Since we last reported on the Seychelles one week ago, the island nation has faced a fresh surge in COVID cases.

Via The American Institute for Economic Research,


Economist Judy Shelton had a crackerjack column in last week's Wall Street Journal on the lack of intellectual and policy diversity at the Federal Reserve. She points out that during the entire term of Chairman Jerome Powell and his predecessor, Janet Yellen, not a single dissenting vote was recorded among the governors. It reminds us of the central bank of the Soviet Union.

A tiger that was seen roaming loose in a Houston area neighborhood over the weekend has yet to be located - but its owner has been identified and arrested.


The exotic animal reportedly belongs to a man named Victor Cuevas, who was out of jail on bond on an "unrelated murder charge", according to local ABC affiliates. "Cuevas is accused of shooting and killing a man in July 2017 and is out on a $125,0…</span>

Authored by Andrew Chen via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),


Economics professor Doug Allen wanted to know why so many early models used to create COVID-19 lockdown policies turned out to be highly incorrect. What he found was that a great majority were based on false assumptions and “tended to over-estimate the benefits and under-estimate the costs.” He found it troubling that policies such as total lockdowns wer…</span>

The NRA was dealt a serious blow on Tuesday after a Texas judge tossed the gun rights organization's bid to declare bankruptcy, saying it was filed in "bad faith" in an effort to dodge litigation in New York.


Judge Harlin Hale tossed the case after New York Attorney General Letitia James and others questioned how legitimate the January 15th bankruptcy filing was, according to a report by Law 360.

The three largest economies by GDP are the US, China, and Japan. These are also the largest country stock markets by aggregate market cap. By our count, US-headquartered stocks add up to $44T in equity value, Chinese (and Hong Kong) stocks add up to $17.3T, and Japanese stocks add up to $6.5T.

Being contrarian is hard work. You need to withstand ridicule, the loss of friends, employment, and acquaintances, face the imminent possibility that most of the time you’ll be wrong, and abandon the warm fuzzy feeling of having your otherwise friendly peers confirming your bias.

Amid all the chaos in equity markets, oil managed to bounce back to modest gains on the day with WTI as a weaker dollar offset some concerns of a growing pile up of crude in the U.S. Gulf Coast as refineries there cut runs in response to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown.

After yesterday's ugliness in big-tech and small-caps, many hoped for a bounce today. But the combination of ARKK gamma and CTA deleveraging meant the pain was not over and both Nasdaq and Russell 2000 plunged into the cash market open (after getting hit as the Asia open and European open)...

Authored by Janita Kan via The Epoch Times,


A bipartisan coalition of attorneys general is urging Facebook to abandon its plans to create a platform for children under the age of 13.

Bloomberg is out with a Monday report chronicling the sad state of affairs the US military has found itself in - notably trying to lure eligible recruits from Generation Z with a cartoon series dubbed "The Calling," which will run on YouTube during May and June.


As Bloomberg notes, "The Army—the U.S. military’s largest service—faces a complex set of problems: the eligible recruiting poo…</span>

A rare direct 'live fire' encounter took place Monday in the Strait of Hormuz between Iranian fast-attack boats and US naval warships. The Iranian vessels came dangerously close to multiple US ships during the incident in the vital waterway off Iran's coast.


The IRGC fast boats departed only after some 30 warning shots were fired by a US Coast Guard vessel that had been escorting the naval group, which included up …</span>

Almost a decade ago, we explained that America had become a bizarre kind of welfare state where, due to the premeditated vagaries of the tax code, hard work was punished.


As a reminder, back in 2012 we showed that it was increasingly lucrative - in the form of actual disposable income - to do the bare minimum, receive minimum wage and collect various welfare entitlements, than to work hard and aspire to …</span>

You probably know someone who never got COVID but whose whole life was transformed by the pandemic; it now has a meaning. 


They were the most cautious, the most locked down, the most disgusted by “deniers” in the White House or in their extended family.

Faced with potentially devastating recall election, California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) appears to be taking a page from French President Emmanuel Macron's book - announcing a new plan on Monday to shower residents in stimulus money thanks to a 'massive tax-collection windfall,' which will help finance a $100 billion state-level economic recovery package - the centerpiece of which would be $11.9 billion i…</span>
