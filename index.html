Say it‚Äôs 2014 and you‚Äôve had this idea for a technocratic¬†Great Reset of the world economy for some time now, but it only works if the entire planet is rocked by a pandemic. How do you go about selling your idea?

In the modern digital world, social media reach is power.


The people with the most followers on Twitter, for example, have a massive platform to spread their messages, while those with large, engaged followings on Instagram are an advertiser‚Äôs dream sponsor partner.

In brief




	
Proof of stake is a consensus mechanism, which makes sure that only legitimate transactions get added to blocks.

	

	

	
It works by having validators lock up their cryptocurrency to secure the network.

As Americans warily eye new data showing both consumer and producer price inflation heating up beyond expectations, few of them realize the Federal Reserve has an explicit goal to relentlessly degrade the purchasing power of their savings.

In any given year during the past decade in the United States, more than 2.5 million Americans have died - from all causes.


The number has grown in recent years, climbing from 2.59 million in 2013 to 2.85 million in 2019. This has been due partially to the US‚Äôs aging population, and also due to rising obesity levels and drug overdoses. In fact, since 2010, growth ra‚Ä¶</span>

We believe the U.S. is walking into the early stages of the Fourth Turning, a subject entertained below. In this note we break down the ideal 2020-2030 portfolio and why it is so different from the 2010-2020 vintage.

Authored by Bryce Coward via Knowledge Leaders Capital blog,


This week saw some doozy inflation readings beginning on Wednesday with the CPI reading and then again on Thursday with the PPI. CPI came in at 4.2% year-over-year, but a whopping 0.8% month-over-month. For context, 0.8% MoM implies 10% annualized inflation! The PPI was also hot, coming in at 6.2% YoY and 0.6% MoM.

We&#x27;ve all experienced the intrusive moment when an advertisement has creepily shown up on our social media feed after talking about it. This is super annoying in a world where corporate America spies on users via smartphone sensors. What&#x27;s even more intrusive is Ford Motor Company&#x27;s new patent wants to use a vehicle&#x27;s camera to detect billboard advertisements then blast the information on its infotainment display.

Despite widespread vaccination availability and even the U.S. CDC saying that vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks, Toronto has decided to cancel an entire summer&#x27;s worth of social functions.


The city has cancelled &quot;all major in-person events for a second straight summer,&quot; CBC reported on Friday.

Alongside some observations we made earlier on tech stocks vs commodities, Deutsche Bank credit strategist Jim Reid writes that while inflation and commodities have dominated the financial airways this week, &quot;although commodities prices have been a big part of the current inflation scare, they have actually dipped since the mid-week US CPI shock which has helped markets adjust to the high print&quot;, something else we pointed out earlier.

Authored by GQ Pan via The Epoch Times,


White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday said it is responsible for colleges to teach the idea that racism is embedded in the American system, dismissing criticism that such teaching aims at indoctrinating American youth.

At the beginning of May, we noted that Taiwan Semiconductor was considering bolstering its production in the U.S., and that President Biden&#x27;s Commerce Secretary was urging more domestic production. Now, it looks like TSMC could be within striking distance of a serious U.S. expansion.¬†

President Biden spoke at the White House earlier this week to address an unsettling national trend ‚Äì millions of jobs going unfilled in an economy still struggling to right itself.

With tech stocks tumbling in recent weeks amid surging inflation fears, at least the commodity sector appears safe from the global reflationary risk-off wave that swept across markets. Besides the ups and downs daily, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite has been on a tear for the last five years. But since commodities began to outperform earlier this year, Nasdaq year-to-date gains are flat.¬†

There have been few politicians in modern times who have done more to undermine personal liberty, capitalist prosperity, small government and especially world peace than the Cheney Clan. So upon Liz Cheney‚Äôs ouster from the #3 job in the US House GOP hierarchy, we say: Good riddance!

                    <span>&quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That To People&quot;: Virginia Gas Station Charges Almost $7 Per Gallon

            
Hours after Virginia governor Ralth Northam declared a state of emergency, one BP gas station was caught charging extortion-level prices on Tuesday amid the lamest &#x27;gas crisis&#x27; in recent memory caused by the Colonial Pipeline hack.







One customer, Lether Kerney, wasn&#x27;t paying attention when she pulled up to the BP gas station on Williamsburg Road - which was charging $5.99 per gallon - shortly before it‚Ä¶</span>

After several impressive quarters of huge gains for its recently launched Disney+ subscription service, Disney couldn&#x27;t quite make it this time and moments ago the company reported Q1 earnings that beat on the bottom line but missed on revenues and subscribers, sending the stock sliding in after hours.


Here are the details: first the good news:

It was an erratic day, which in so many ways was a mirror image of yesterday, and even though today&#x27;s blistering PPI print confirmed yesterday&#x27;s near-record CPI number, traders who expected a continuation of yesterday&#x27;s action were left nursing big losses.


Perhaps it was the fervent defense of the &quot;transitory inflation&quot; narrative on Wall Street, but whatever the reason, yesterday&#x27;s surge in the VIX reversed‚Ä¶</span>

Bank of America&#x27;s economists have been on a roll in the past three months.


Back in February, the bank looked at its credit and debit card spending data and concluded that consensus was far, far too low, predicting that the stimmy-fueled January retail sales print would be above 4.1%.







Not only was BofA&#x27;s outlier forecast right, but the headline retail sales number came in even higher: at a whopping 5.3%, nearly 5x higher than the consensus ‚Ä¶</span>

Senator Rand Paul continued to slam White House medical advisor Thursday, saying that Anthony Fauci could be culpable for the entire coronavirus pandemic.







Paul was attacked by leftist media Wednesday for merely questioning Fauci‚Äôs extensive role in granting funding to the Wuhan Institute of Virology at a Senate hearing.

Chicago is a dangerous liberal-run city with recent crime statistics that show gun violence is out of control. One unlikely source of gun violence is three enlisted soldiers at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, who operated a gun smuggling operation into the metro area.¬†

Authored by Andrew Chen via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),


Economics professor Doug Allen wanted to know why so many early models used to create COVID-19 lockdown policies turned out to be highly incorrect. What he found was that a great majority were based on false assumptions and ‚Äútended to over-estimate the benefits and under-estimate the costs.‚Äù He found it troubling that policies such as total lockdowns wer‚Ä¶</span>

The NRA was dealt a serious blow on Tuesday after a Texas judge tossed the gun rights organization&#x27;s bid to declare bankruptcy, saying it was filed in &quot;bad faith&quot; in an effort to dodge litigation in New York.


Judge Harlin Hale tossed the case after New York Attorney General Letitia James and others questioned how legitimate the January 15th bankruptcy filing was, according to a report by Law 360.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he has officially scheduled a vote for Wednesday to oust House Republican¬†Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) from her post, soon after he endorsed Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) for the No. 3 leadership spot.

The sexual harassment investigation against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) has widened in scope, as the state AG&#x27;s office has begun looking into whether a top Cuomo adviser linked access to COVID-19 vaccines with political support for the governor, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.

A rare direct &#x27;live fire&#x27; encounter took place Monday in the Strait of Hormuz between Iranian fast-attack boats and US naval warships. The Iranian vessels came dangerously close to multiple US ships during the incident in the vital waterway off Iran&#x27;s coast.
