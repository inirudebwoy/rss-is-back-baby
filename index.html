The Apple AirTag hasn't even been out for two weeks, and someone has already hacked into the new tracking device. 







9to5Mac reports that security researcher "Stack Smashing" was able to "break into the microcontroller of the AirTag" and modify elements of the item tracker software.

Via InternationalMan.com,


Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) centers around the notion that the economy in general, and money in particular, should be the creatures of the State.

Authored by Michael Gartz via The American Institute for Economic Research,


The year 2020 generated several visible changes to the structure of our society. In the US, citizens migrated to different parts of the country, workers changed or lost jobs, and education became virtual. 







One thing, however, has not changed: despite expectations of a baby boom from idle couples locked down together, birth rates continue to fall. Birth rates were already…</span>

Chicago is a dangerous liberal-run city with recent crime statistics that show gun violence is out of control. One unlikely source of gun violence is three enlisted soldiers at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, who operated a gun smuggling operation into the metro area.

There are three interrelated political factions that wield actual power to change blind U.S. support for Israel: the U.S. Congress, the Democratic Party, and the Biden Administration. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who claims to oppose this U.S. posture toward Israel, has significant influence in and responsibility for each: she i…</span>

More than 120 retired generals, admirals, and military officers signed a letter that warned that the United States is embroiled in an existential fight and called on “all citizens” to get involved in local and state politics.

House Republicans voted to oust Rep.

A tiger that was seen roaming loose in a Houston area neighborhood over the weekend has yet to be located - but its owner has been identified and arrested.


The exotic animal reportedly belongs to a man named Victor Cuevas, who was out of jail on bond on an "unrelated murder charge", according to local ABC affiliates. "Cuevas is accused of shooting and killing a man in July 2017 and is out on a $125,0…</span>

Authored by Andrew Chen via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),


Economics professor Doug Allen wanted to know why so many early models used to create COVID-19 lockdown policies turned out to be highly incorrect. What he found was that a great majority were based on false assumptions and “tended to over-estimate the benefits and under-estimate the costs.” He found it troubling that policies such as total lockdowns wer…</span>

The NRA was dealt a serious blow on Tuesday after a Texas judge tossed the gun rights organization's bid to declare bankruptcy, saying it was filed in "bad faith" in an effort to dodge litigation in New York.


Judge Harlin Hale tossed the case after New York Attorney General Letitia James and others questioned how legitimate the January 15th bankruptcy filing was, according to a report by Law 360.

By our count, US-headquartered stocks add up to $44T in equity value, Chinese (and Hong Kong) stocks add up to $17.3T, and Japanese stocks add up to $6.5T.

The phenomenon of "cancel culture" is a toxic one metastasizing into a woke revolution war empowered by Big Tech and Big Business.

However, the art of canceling has progressed well beyond canceling public figures and is now used to garget average folks. The result can be devastating for ordinary people who may f…</span>

Authored by Joakim Book via The American Institute for Economic Research,


Being contrarian is hard work. You need to withstand ridicule, the loss of friends, employment, and acquaintances, face the imminent possibility that most of the time you’ll be wrong, and abandon the warm fuzzy feeling of having your otherwise friendly peers confirming your bias. 







Yet, authentic critics are crucially important, even if (and when) they are wrong. When at least some of u…</span>

Amid all the chaos in equity markets, oil managed to bounce back to modest gains on the day with WTI as a weaker dollar offset some concerns of a growing pile up of crude in the U.S. Gulf Coast as refineries there cut runs in response to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown.



Traders are expecting “a gradual resolution to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown,” according to Louise Dickson, an analyst at consultant Rystad Energy.

After yesterday's ugliness in big-tech and small-caps, many hoped for a bounce today. But the combination of ARKK gamma and CTA deleveraging meant the pain was not over and both Nasdaq and Russell 2000 plunged into the cash market open (after getting hit as the Asia open and European open)...

Does the biggest downside miss in history for employment mean higher inflation? That’s the debate raging through markets and indeed DB research.


I lean towards the inflation side. Remember the Chart of the Day on Thursday showing small business “jobs hard to fill” was at record levels last month - a good guide with hindsight to the payroll number issues. (as of this morning, this…</span>

Authored by Janita Kan via The Epoch Times,


A bipartisan coalition of attorneys general is urging Facebook to abandon its plans to create a platform for children under the age of 13.







The attorneys general sent a letter to Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg arguing that the use of social media can be detrimental to children and that the company had previously failed to protect the welfare of children on its platforms.

The sexual harassment investigation against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) has widened in scope, as the state AG's office has begun looking into whether a top Cuomo adviser linked access to COVID-19 vaccines with political support for the governor, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.

Bloomberg is out with a Monday report chronicling the sad state of affairs the US military has found itself in - notably trying to lure eligible recruits from Generation Z with a cartoon series dubbed "The Calling," which will run on YouTube during May and June.

A rare direct 'live fire' encounter took place Monday in the Strait of Hormuz between Iranian fast-attack boats and US naval warships. The Iranian vessels came dangerously close to multiple US ships during the incident in the vital waterway off Iran's coast.


The IRGC fast boats departed only after some 30 warning shots were fired by a US Coast Guard vessel that had been escorting the naval group, which included up …</span>

Almost a decade ago, we explained that America had become a bizarre kind of welfare state where, due to the premeditated vagaries of the tax code, hard work was punished.


As a reminder, back in 2012 we showed that it was increasingly lucrative - in the form of actual disposable income - to do the bare minimum, receive minimum wage and collect various welfare entitlements, than to work hard and aspire to …</span>

Faced with potentially devastating recall election, California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) appears to be taking a page from French President Emmanuel Macron's book - announcing a new plan on Monday to shower residents in stimulus money thanks to a 'massive tax-collection windfall,' which will help finance a $100 billion state-level economic recovery package - the centerpiece of which would be $11.9 billion i…</span>
