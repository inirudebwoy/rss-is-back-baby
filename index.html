Authored by Alasdair Macleod via GoldMoney.com,


There is a growing recognition in financial circles that price inflation will increase significantly in the near future, and official estimates that it will be a temporary phenomenon limited to an average of 2% are overly optimistic. There is, therefore, increasing speculation about the need for interest rates to rise.

With lumber prices up 67% since the start of this year and up 340% from a year ago, according to Random Lengths, a wood products industry tracking firm, adding tens of thousands of dollars to new residential builds, there is a viable new option to construct a home (lumber free) through machine-printed clay.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday issued a statement that's sure to once again provoke Beijing, urging the World Health Organization (WHO) to formally invite Taiwan's participation in the global body which works alongside the UN.

President Biden recently announced ambitious plans to install huge offshore industrial wind facilities along America’s Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and Pacific coasts. His goal is to churn out 30 gigawatts (30,000 megawatts) of wind capacity by 2030, ensuring the U.S. “leads by example” in fighting the “climate crisis.”

From the gas pump to the grocery aisle, Americans have been suffering from "sticker shock" for the first time in years. While the Fed continues to insist that inflationary pressures will be "transitory", sell-side banks like Bank of America are raising the prospect of economically debilitating "stagflation".

Now that Germany has broken with the US over the question of whether to back a waiver for COVID vaccine IP that's been proposed at the WTO, pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer that were planning on COVID-19 vaccines becoming a permanent revenue stream are seeing their opportunities for profit threatened.

Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, is on course for a major battle with progressive Democrats over whether the party should push to expand Medicare eligibility as part of the Biden administration's so-called 'human infrastructure' agenda (since very little of it goes actually goes towards 'infrastructure' as traditionally defined).

Joe Biden is in a pickle.  







He wants to continue to convince Americans they should get the experimental biological agent (AKA "the vaccine"), but, as Tucker Carlson pointed out last week, the administration and the CDC have offered no explanation as to why you need to continue to wear a mask after you have taken "the vaccine."

Japanese newswire Kyodo just confirmed that Japan plans to extend its state of emergency which covers Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures. The third state of emergency has been in place since April 25 and had been set to expire on May 11, but officials are concerned that the brief shutdown hasn't been sufficient to suppress infections, especially as cases start to accelerate across Asia.

                <p>Gundlach Warns America's "Unfunded Liabilities" Are $163 Trillion, More Than 5x National Debt

            
DoubleLine's Jeffrey Gundlach called the Fed's bluff late last month, telling investors during an interview that he suspected the central bank was merely "guessing" about the impact of inflation being "transitory".


Since then, we have only received more signs that inflationary pressures are growing in the US economy, while a growing number of investors have been persuaded to agree with Gundlach.…</p>

By Jim Reid, head of credit strategy at Deutsche Bank



As it's now May, it's worth examining the “sell in May and go away” adage.


Today’s Chart of the Day looks at the average daily path of the S&P 500 using data back to 1928. It shows that using 93 years of data, the “average” year does see its first notable correction in mid-May with the index only surpassing these levels again by early July. However, by early August the upward trend seen between…</p>

We've all known that nationalizing student loan debt would turn out to be a terrible decision (just as it is when the government nationalizes any industry). We have been saying it on this site for years: it skews the market, offers capital to people who don't have the means to pay it back and allows universities to price gouge, leading to a lower quality of education.

In a major rebuke to the west's biggest vaccine makers (including Pfizer, Moderna and J&J), President Joe Biden has decided to break with the Bill Gates-backed status quo and support a WTO initiative to make COVID-19 vaccine intellectual property open to all.

Following almost two months of roughly flat-lining new Covid cases in the US, we are now again seeing clear signs of new improvement despite a notable slowdown in covid immunizations.


In recent days, many in the administration and its media propaganda arm, have tried to spook the broader population with scary stories that the recent pace of vaccinations will slow down sufficiently to prevent herd immunity from being reached…</p>

The emergence of the internet was met with hope and enthusiasm by people who understood that the plutocrat-controlled mainstream media were manipulating public opinion to manufacture consent for the status quo. The democratization of information-sharing was going to give rise to a public consciousness that is emancipated from the domination of plutocratic n…</p>

Earlier today we noted that the one thing every company was obsessing during their Q1 earnings call: inflation. As BofA equity strategist Savita Subramanian calculated, mentions of “inflation” quadrupled YoY, and after last week, mentions have exploded nearly 800% YoY. More striking was her observation that as "mentions skyrocket to near record highs from 2011" these point to at the very least, “transitory hyper-inflation …</p>

A stronger dollar and a hawkish Yellen were not enough to slow oil's rebound as more US states eased lockdowns and the European Union sought to attract more travellers, which would help offset weakened fuel demand in India as COVID-19 cases soar.

With the world slowly emerging from the covid pandemic, ridesharing services are seeing an impressive return to normalcy as the just released results from Lyft showed.


After seeing its revenue crash as much as 61% in the first full post-covid quarter, moments ago Lyft reported that in Q1 2021, earnings were down 36% from a year ago (and up 7% from Q4), the smallest decline in a year, even if total revenues of $609MM (whic…</p>

As states resort to cash rewards and other tactics to try and encourage reluctant (or just plain lazy) adults to get their COVID-19 jabs, the White House on Tuesday just upped the pressure, warning the (mostly red) states that have lagged in the vaccine rollout in recent weeks that the federal government will start allocating unordered vaccines to other states.

So Powell finally used the F word: Froth. Being non specific though as one would expect and being super careful as to not overtly link monetary policies to the said froth we can note some faint sense of recognition on the side of central bankers that the liquidity avalanche they have unleashed has resulted in market distortions.

An Icelandic resident uploaded a stunning video on YouTube of a new volcanic eruption early Sunday morning. 


YouTube "Sigfús Steindórsson" has been following a new fissure vent that opened a couple of weeks ago and is visible from Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland. 


The latest development from the fissure was a "monster-size lava fountain, the biggest since the eruption started," said Steindórsson. They said the eruption occurred around…</p>

His critics often joke that when President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan pledges democratic reforms, one should run away immediately. His latest charm offensive in November, aimed at repairing Turkey's badly-strained ties with the West and Western institutions, has proven that the joke still holds value.

It is comforting that the Fourth turning is part of a natural cycle but also very disturbing that it is a period of crisis. As we know from previous cycles, many people suffer and die during a fourth turning.  However, I think we all know that a crisis is upon us as the corruption, collusion, scheming, propaganda, and self interest reaches its peak.

For nearly a century, gold had been pegged at roughly $20.67/oz. Then in 1934, FDR banned private holdings, confiscated people’s gold, and set the value at $35/oz for use in international trade/settlement. It remained anchored at that price for decades.
