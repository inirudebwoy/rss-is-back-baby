                    <span>The First American City To Authorize &quot;Reparations&quot; Is Already Regretting It

            
Evanston, Illinois made headlines earlier this year by becoming the first city in the US to authorize &quot;reparations&quot; in the form of payments to compensate Black Americans for abuses done to family members. The Chicago suburb&#x27; City Council voted back in March to distribute $400K to eligible black households, with each qualifying family receiving up to $25K for homeownership and or improvement grants, as well as mortgage assistance.


But while proponents on the left praised the move as unprecedented, it turns out that those who designed the proposal were careful to ensure the word &quot;reparations&quot; was nowhere near it. In fact, a lengthy Bloomberg piece telling the story of how the proposal came to be s…</span>

                    <span>US Embassies Worldwide Are Flying BLM Flags This Week

            
US embassies and consulates across the globe this week flew Black Lives Matter (BLM) flags after being authorized and encouraged to do so for the first time ever in a memo by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. It&#x27;s now expected to be a regular practice, particularly in instances of race-related events or memorials.


Just ahead of the May 25 one-year anniversary of George Floyd&#x27;s death, a State Department memo was sent to all diplomatic staff worldwide saying that it &quot;supports the use of the term &#x27;Black Lives Matter&#x27; in messaging content&quot;. It further encouraged speeches and commemorative events related to diplomatic engagements on the anniversary &quot;and beyond&quot;. Subsequently on Tuesday BLM flags were photographed flying …</span>

Authored by Brandon Smith via Alt-Market.us,


What kind of abysmal social and economic conditions would make at least five separate counties of US voters want to flee a state to join the borders of another state? Well, all it takes is a cult of insane Marxists running the entire state into the ground from the safety of their metropolitan communes while demanding that people submit their undying fealty to the draconian medical mandates of an elitist minority. Yeah, things have to get pretty bad to inspire so many people into leaving and taking half the state with them.

The Daily Caller News Foundation and one of its reporters, Thomas Catenacci, is suing Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) over her decision to only grant interviews to &#x27;black or brown journalists.&#x27;







The lawsuit, filed by Daily Caller and Judicial Watch in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that Lightfoot&#x27;s denial violates the plaintiffs&#x27; First Amendment rights, as well as Catenacci&#x27;s right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.


&quot;It’s absurd that an elected official believes she can discriminate on the basis of race,&quot; said DCNF Editor-in-Chief Ethan Barton. &quot;Mayor Lightfoot’s decision is clearly blocking press freedom through racial discriminati…</span>

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has just quietly given American companies the green light to to do whatever it takes to &quot;incentivize&quot; American workers to accept the coronavirus vaccine.







As vaccinations continue to slow, and states beef up incentives including lotteries and cash prizes to any adults who agree to get vaccinated who haven&#x27;t already, the EEOC has just issued some long-awaited guidance on how far companies can go in pushing workers to be vaccinated. Some companies, including Delta Air Lines, have said they won&#x27;t hire anyone who hasn&#x27;t already been vaccinated.

                    <span>Japan Extends State Of Emergency As Support For Canceling Olympics Rises

            
As demands to cancel the Tokyo Olympics intensify, Japan on Friday extended a state of emergency in Tokyo and eight other prefectures until June 20 as hospitals struggle to handle a rise in COVID-sickened patients.







The state of emergency had previously been slated to end on May 31, but strains on the medical system are still too intense for Japanese officials to be entirely comfortable with the current situation. Japan has seen a record number of COVID patients in critical condition in recent days, even as the number of new infections has slowed. This has prompted worries about infectious new COVID &quot;variants&quot; spreading in the country with the start of the Olympics just a few weeks away.

Following Friday&#x27;s bombshell revelation that Dr. Anthony Fauci has supported &#x27;gain of function&#x27; research, even arguing that the &quot;risks&quot; (which include a worldwide pandemic caused by a potential lab accident) were outweighed by the potential benefits to humanity, it&#x27;s worth revisiting a vote that quietly took place earlier this week in the Senate.







Sen. Paul has been arguing with Dr. Fauci about the merits of the research and whether they&#x27;re outweighed by the risks of deadly lab leaks for weeks now. He memorably took the good doctor to task during a hearing of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee hectoring over his prior support for gain of function research in China, to …</span>

Many industries were throttled, bludgeoned, beaten, and even destroyed during the lockdowns of 2020. It will be years before the damage is repaired, and some of it is irreparable. 







One industry that did not suffer was that which was and is devoted to writing scientific papers on the Coronavirus. Talk about boom times! A report from October 2020 estimates that 87,000 studies have been written and published in some form on the topic. It’s surely more than 100,000 by now. These writers do not produce content out of the goodness of their hearts. It’s the old rule: subsidize something (thank you Bill Gates) and you get more of it.

Election season in Mexico has always been a dangerous game, with politicians regularly knocked off by cartels seeking to install &#x27;friendly&#x27; candidates by process of elimination. 







Since the start of the electoral process in Sep. 2020, eighty-eight politicians have been murdered nationwide, according to TeleSur. The most recent, Citizens Movement (MC) candidate Alma Barragan, was shot to death while driving by unidentified assailants, just a few hours after she attended a campaign event. Barragan marks the third murdered candidate in Guanajuato alone ahead of the region&#x27;s June 6 election.

Authored by Vanessa Serna via The Epoch Times,


Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer joined 43 California counties on May 26 in filing a civil lawsuit against the early release of 76,000 state inmates.



“It is my job as district attorney to keep Orange County safe,” Spitzer said in a press release.


“The public must be given the opportunity to question why the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation would decide that returning murders, child molesters, and rapists back into our neighborhoods more quickly somehow constitutes an emergency.”



The lawsuit filed in Sacramento Superior Court is intended to invalidate emergency regulations by the California Department of …</span>

                    <span>&quot;Shame, Shame, Shame&quot; - Trump Laments Memorial Day Drivers Facing Highest Gas Prices In Seven Years

            
Among the &quot;new&quot; things that Americans will notice during this year&#x27;s post-Covid Memorial Day will be skyrocketing prices at the pump.


Drivers are in store for the highest prices in seven years this summer, Reuters writes this week, as retail gas prices are the most expensive since 2014 at about $3.04 per gallon. 







And those prices have nowhere to go but up, as a year&#x27;s worth of pent up demand for leisure activities, vacation and summer sun come to fruition over the next three or four months. This could drive up prices even further during peak travel weeks during the summer.

Authored by Matt Taibbi via TK News,


Joe Biden is cruising, in a happy-place few politicians reach. Outside of a few grumpy right-wing outlets he faces almost no hostile press questioning, political threats within his own party are minimal, and his approval rating, if one believes the latest Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, hovers at an astonishing 64%.





Biden has the press paper-trained to a degree we haven’t seen in modern times. Not even at the height of the media’s drooling love affair with Barack Obama — a phenomenon I confess I was part of — did we ever see such enthusiastic, reflexive backing of White House messaging. The Biden press even reverses course on a dime when needed, with the past weeks being a supreme e…</span>

Authored by Peter Schiff via SchiffGold.com,


It’s dawning on many investors that our post-Covid financial problems may not be as easily solved as Washington claims...







The latest clue that trouble is brewing has come from the sudden and dramatic arrival of inflation. On May 12, it was revealed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) had risen 4.2% year-over-year, the fastest pace since 2008.


Some tried to downplay concern by pointing out that the gains resulted from the “base effect” of comparing current prices with the artificially depressed “Covid lockdown” prices of March and April of last year. But that ignores the more alarming trend of near-term price acceleration.

America&#x27;s top virologist, Anthony Fauci, argued in 2012 that the risks of a lab accident sparking a pandemic are outweighed by the potential benefits of manipulating viruses via gain-of-function research, according to previously unsurfaced remarks reported by Sharri Markson via The Australian.







&quot;In an unlikely but conceivable turn of events, what if that scientist becomes infected with the virus, which leads to an outbreak and ultimately triggers a pandemic?&quot; Fauci wrote in the American Society for Microbiology in 2012, adding &quot;Many ask reasonable questions: given the possibility of such a scenario – however remote – should the initial experiments have been performed and/or pub…</span>

Update (1330ET): President Biden just released the much-leaked and strawman&#x27;d Fiscal Year 2022 budget request to Congress on Friday, the first formal budget of his presidency.


The topline budget request for 2022 is $6 trillion. But of this, as we detailed below, only $300 billion is new spending requested for next year. Instead, the vast majority of it will be spent on programs the government is obligated by law to fund, like Medicare, Social Security and interest on the national debt. 



“Put together, this budget is an agenda for robust, durable economic growth and broadly shared prosperity,” said Shalanda Young, Biden’s acting White House budget director.

It was back in February when we first said that (almost) nobody was paying attention to the &quot;mind-boggling liquidity&quot; that was about to hit the markets in the form of hundreds of billions in cash released from the Treasury&#x27;s TGA account held at the Fed. This historic liquidity injection by the Treasury and not the Fed (which continues to this day to inject $120BN in liquidity monthly from its ongoing QE) was, as we put it, a form of backdoor QE, which would push asset prices higher and depress real rates.

In what was at least the third flashing-red headline for the day referencing the scandal-plagued Swiss Bank, moments ago Bloomberg reported that Credit Suisse, still humiliated from the billions it lost on Archegos and Greensill and countless subsequent banker terminations and defections, has temporarily barred clients from pulling their cash from a feeder fund that that was sold as an investment option for rich clients at the bank’s wealth arm, and which invests with Renaissance Technologies &quot;after the str…</span>

We may have a little more insight as to reports yesterday that Tesla was pre-paying for semiconductor parts to secure supply. Yesterday, we guessed that Tesla&#x27;s new &quot;pre-payment&quot; terms could be a result of suppliers showing little patience with the automaker, who has over $6 billion in payables.


But a new report overnight from DigiTimes Asia sheds more light on the situation, leading us to believe that Tesla could simply be short of supplies and desperately in need of parts to be able to hit production targets. 


The report notes that Tesla is &quot;scrambling&quot; for instrument cluster supplies:

With Tesla falling out of favor in China, one domestic EV maker, Li Auto, is predicting a tailwind.


The Chinese Tesla rival, which produces the Li One SUV, predicts that its sales will rise at least 15% in from April to June as a result of Tesla running &quot;foul of angry Chinese customers,&quot; SCMP reported on Wednesday. 


The company&#x27;s Li One SUV competes with Tesla&#x27;s Model Y. It is an extended-range sport-utility vehicle (SUV) that is priced at 328,000 yuan (US$51,316), according to the report.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


An Atlanta city councilman running for mayor, who last year supported a measure to reduce city police funding by tens of millions of dollars, had his car stolen by children on Wednesday, he and police confirmed.







Councilman Antonio Brown had been attending a ceremony in northeastern Atlanta at 12 p.m. Wednesday when several children jumped into his vehicle and drove away, he said.



“You don’t immediately think, ‘Oh, these kids are going to steal my car,’” Brown told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, referring to the incident, adding that the thieves appeared to be children, although one of them “acted as though he had a gun…</span>

Lockheed Martin and General Motors are teaming to develop the next-generation lunar vehicle for NASA&#x27;s upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon. 


The Artemis program aims to land astronauts on the lunar surface by the midpoint of the decade. For exploration purposes, astronauts will need &quot;surface mobility that is critical to enable and sustain long-term exploration of the lunar surface. These next-generation rovers will dramatically extend the range of astronauts,&quot; a Lockheed press release read. 







The new lunar vehicle &quot;may allow astronauts to explore the lunar surface in unprecedented fashion and support discovery in places where humans have never gone before,&quot; the defense contract continued.

“A long-term outage owing to EMP could disable most critical supply chains, leaving the U.S. population living in conditions similar to centuries past, prior to the advent of electric power. In the 1800s, the U.S. population was less than 60 million, and those people had many skills and assets necessary for survival without today’s infrastructure. An extended blackout today could result in the death of a large fraction of the American people through the effects of societal collapse, disease and starvation. While national planning and preparation for such events could help mitigate the damage, few such actions are currently under way or even being conte…</span>

                    <span>Australia Imposes 4th COVID Lockdown On Melbourne As New Cluster Found

            
Despite essentially cutting off all international travel in an attempt to &quot;raise the drawbridge&quot; and keep out COVID-19 after mostly purging it from their society, Australia is entering its fourth COVID-inspired lockdown in Melbourne, the country&#x27;s second-largest city. The lockdown began Thursday and was set to remain in place for a week for Melbourne and the rest of Victoria state after a new cluster of cases was uncovered, yielding 26 new infections, including one person who was sent to intensive care, the AP reports.


Another 10K people have reportedly had some form of contact with those infected.

                    <span>Will The Madness Of 2020 Last?

            
Authored by Victor Davis Hanson, op-ed via The Epoch Times,


The COVID-19 pandemic is ending with mass vaccinations. So is the national quarantine. The rioting, looting, and arson that began in the summer of 2020 is finally sputtering out.


The acrimony over the 2020 election is fading. Trump Derangement Syndrome became abstract when Donald Trump left office and was ostracized from social media.


In other words, the American people are slowly regaining their senses after the epidemic of mass hysteria that gripped the nation last year.







But many Americans wonder whether what Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and the hard left wrought last year will last when the nation is no longer gripped by 2020 madness.

                    <span>The Fed Explains Why Stocks Melt-Up In Overnight Trading

            
By now everyone has seen some iteration of this chart (most recently discussed here), which shows that whereas stocks are generally flat over longer periods of time during the regular &quot;cash&quot;, or day session, they tend to melt up during the overnight hours when liquidity is far lower and when the &quot;pajama trades&quot; come out and play.







And while there is no single, widely accepted reason for this &quot;overnight drift&quot;, the post-closed meltup phenomenon has been one of the most popular and recurring strategies in equity markets, with many traders selling spoos when the day session begins and then re-buying at the market close in pursuit of scarce alpha.

Fifteen Republican State Treasurers sent a warning that they will pull assets from financial institutions if they give in to Federal pressure to de-carbonize and “refuse to lend to or invest in” the fossil fuel and coal industry.

WeWork co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann may well be remembered as the worst CEO ever. But that hasn&#x27;t stopped him from collecting billions of dollars in payouts on his way out the door at WeWork, as SoftBank&#x27;s Masayoshi Son was forced to effectively bribe Neumann to relinquish control of the flailing office rental company.







A legal fight erupted when SoftBank tried to renege on some $3 billion it owed to Neumann and other early investors, but it appears this issue was settled out of court.


But according to the latest documents released by the company, Neumann has just received even more goodies from the firm, including a final &quot;enhanced&quot; package worth roughly one qua…</span>

                    <span>&#x27;It Would Be Detrimental To A Lot Of Companies&#x27;: Jamie Dimon Slams Biden Tax Plan

            
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon went scorched earth on President Biden&#x27;s tax plan, which would raise the current corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, arguing that it would result in capital flight out of the United States.







&quot;The tax increase is actually four times what the tax decrease was from 2017,&quot; Dimon said during a Thursday virtual hearing before the US House Committee on Financial Services. &quot;You all know the phrase the devil is in the details, well the details here are all that matter, not the top line of 28%.&quot;


&quot;If you want to have a healthy, growing, competitive America against the rest of the world, you need a global, competitive tax rate,&quot; Dimon added. &quot;It would be detrimental to a lot of companies, it would push a lot of capital overseas.&quot;





Dimon cast doubt on the Biden tax plan earlier this month, calling it &#x27;a little crazy,&#x27; however today&#x27;s comments mark the strongest pushback yet from the top banker.


&quot;We’re just throwing money. It doesn’t work,&quot; Dimon said in a recorded interview for the JPMorgan general membership meeting on May 6, adding &quot;I’m concerned about how the money’s going to be spent.&quot;


&quot;We already waste tremendous sums of money.&quot;

China&#x27;s recent aggressive crackdown on soaring commodity prices (going as far as dragging the PBOC&#x27;s monetary regime into it, with the central bank stating this morning that the surging yuan is in no way a response to explosive commodity prices, honestly), has provided the world&#x27;s deflationists with some hope that the recent huge spike in commodity prices may be coming to an end. To others, like Goldman&#x27;s extremely bullish commodities team, China&#x27;s intervention has led to a rather unpleasant hit to its thesis, and in response today&#x27;s Goldman&#x27;s head of commodities, Jeffrey Currie drafted a note saying that the pullback in commodities after China’s warnings over onshore specu…</span>

Authored by Patrick Andriesen via IllinoisPolicy.org,


Grocery and liquor stores would be barred from selling beer, wine and liquor after 10 p.m. if Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot gets her way. She said the move would curb crime by stopping gatherings outside liquor stores and help recovering bars and restaurants.







Mayor Lightfoot introduced an amendment Wednesday that would permanently ban Chicago stores from selling beer, wine and other alcoholic drinks after 10 p.m.


In April 2020, Lightfoot instituted the controversial 9 p.m. liquor curfew in Chicago to prevent residents from gathering outside during the coronavirus pandemic. Stores had been allowed to stay open until 2 a.m. most…</span>

Never one for understatement, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale appeared on CNBC this week to discuss cryptocurrencies and the world&#x27;s central banks efforts to re-centralize control of what the establishment is clearly losing control over.







As Henry Kissinger reportedly once said, &quot;Who controls money control the world&quot; echoing the infamous quote from Mayer Amschel Rothschild: &quot;Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!&quot;


So, is it any surprise that the loss of faith in those &quot;who control the money&quot; has sparked a decentralized &quot;control&quot; of the money - cryptocurrencies - that are, for all intent and purpose above both pol…</span>

Authored by Cal Thomas, op-ed via The Epoch Times,


Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas is reportedly considering the development of tools that would help America’s children discern truth from lies and know when they are being fed “disinformation.”







The Washington Times, which first reported the story, says a department spokesperson declined to give details, but that more information would be revealed “in the coming weeks.”


Mayorkas might want to start by fact-checking his recent claim that the U.S. southern border is “closed.” He made the statement when news pictures showed waves of people crossing the border. Should kids believe him, or their “lying eyes”?

                    <span>​​​​​​​Russian Spy Ship Quietly Parked In Waters Off Hawaii

            
A Russian Navy surveillance ship parked in international waters off Kauai, an island in the Central Pacific, part of the Hawaiian archipelago, has delayed a Missile Defense Agency missile test, according to Honolulu Star-Advertiser. 


The US Pacific Fleet confirmed Wednesday that it &quot;is aware of the Russian vessel operating in international waters in the vicinity of Hawaii, and will continue to track it through the duration of its time here.&quot; 


The ship has been operating in international waters just 13 nautical miles west of Kauai for several days. The vessel is not broadcasting an automatic identification system signal. 



&quot;Through maritime patrol aircraft, surface ships and joint capabilities, we can closely monitor all vessels in the Indo-Pacific area of operations,&quot; US Pacific Fleet&#x27;s statement continued. 



U.S. Naval Institute News first identified the presence of the spy ship, indicating it was a Russian Navy Vishnya-class auxiliary general intelligence (AGI) ship Kareliya (SSV-535). Honolulu Star-Advertiser then expanded on this and said the vessel is in the vicinity of the Pacific Missile Range and has &quot;delayed&quot; a missile test. 







The question remains: Why does a Russian signals intelligence vessel sit off the coast of Kauai? Is Moscow sending the Biden administration a message of new strength in the Pacific?

                    <span>Retail Investors Storm Back Into The Market: This Is What They Are Buying

            
It was less than than three weeks ago when we first noted that retail participation in stock trading had seemingly collapsed after a wild start to the year, with JPMorgan reporting that US retail investors share in equity trading declined sharply in March after a strong January and February, and a record high share of 28% in December.







And while April and the start of May exhibited a similar continued decline in both retail participation and performance of &quot;retail favorite&quot; stocks, which underperformed the broader market by 8% since mid-March, things have changed dramatically in the past two weeks and as Goldman notes in a new piece discussing the &quot;Recent performance of stocks with high levels of retail activity&quot;, stocks with high retail trading volumes have outperformed by 5% since May 12th, with half of this outperformance occurring yesterday (Wednesday). 


Echoing JPMorgan&#x27;s observations, Goldman then notes that while declines in daily trades at retail brokers showed significant declines last week (DARTs), leading to fresh concerns that retail trading activity was on the decline - with many going so far as to conclude that retail investors were no longer investing their stimmies - this too appears to have been the wrong conclusion, as the rise in retail stocks yesterday and especially today, when both GME and AMC have soared...







... suggesting it may be too early to call an end to elevated retail activity.







So what are retail investors buying? Based on Goldman&#x27;s “small-lot trading” analysis, these are the 50 stocks where retail was the most active yesterday in shares and options.







Not enough? Here are the stocks with high “small lot” trading activity in Options

Authored by Steve Wastson via Summit News,


President Trump‘s former national security advisor Michael Flynn commented on the renewed focus on the theory that the coronavirus came from a lab in Wuhan, saying that he believes it was a ‘weaponised operation’.



“We’ve had over a year of people all over the world having to answer tough questions,” Flynn said during an interview on 1320 AM WJAS.



The three star general continued “The people in this country are demanding answers. I believe we what we are going to find out is that this was a weaponized operation by the nation of China with some collaboration… with other countries.”

If you had a sneaking suspicion that Wall Street was starting to bet against the &quot;untouchable&quot; Cathie Wood, as we did over the last couple months, you were right.


Today it was revealed that &quot;about two dozen investment advisers&quot; that included Balyasny Asset Management and a unit of Blackstone bought put options on ARK&#x27;s Innovation ETF during the first quarter. Blackstone bought puts on 1.3 million ARKK shares and Balyasny acquired puts on 436,500 shares. 


The managers saw Wood&#x27;s fund as a &quot;alternative to buffer against a slump in stocks that surged during the pandemic,&quot; that buying puts on an index, the report said. In other words, the asset managers were so confident in Wood&#x27;s ab…</span>

President Biden is just fine releasing the US Intelligence community&#x27;s 90-day examination of where COVID-19 originated, unless it contains surprises.


Shortly before boarding Air Force One for a Thursday trio to Ohio, Biden was ashed whether he planned to release the intelligence report, to which he replied &quot;Yes,&quot; adding &quot;unless there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m unaware of.&quot;

                    <span>Life Insurance &amp; COVID-19; Something Doesn&#x27;t Make Sense

            
Authored by Jeff Harris via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace &amp; Prosperity,


You would think that during the worst Pandemic since the 1918 Spanish Flu life insurance companies would be hedging their bets to avoid major losses from Covid-19. 


I haven’t written a life policy for several years so I was wondering what was going on?


I called one of the brokers I deal with that interacts with hundreds of big life insurers to get an inside look into how the Covid crisis has changed their business.





Imagine my surprise when she said it was pretty much business as usual!


Last year when the hysteria was just getting ramped up she did say the companies temporarily tightened up underwriting and reduced the amount of coverage they would offer. But as time went by and the hard data came rolling in those same companies went back to business as usual.
I asked her specifically if life insurers wanted a Covid test as part of the underwriting process and she said none that she was aware of.


Hmm, that’s pretty interesting isn’t it?


The most lethal pandemic in decades descends on the globe with deadly mutations taking millions of innocent lives and the life insurance companies couldn’t care less.
I also asked if the cost per thousand of coverage had increased due to Covid and again she said no.


Rates were pretty much the same as they were before the Covid Pandemic ravaged the earth.


Life Insurance companies are very risk adverse. 


They don’t like losing money to unnecessary claims.


The fact they’re treating Covid as a nonevent should be an indicator that something is very wrong with the whole narrative.

President Biden, possibly most famous for his - and his son&#x27;s - business dealings in China coming into question whilst running for the Presidency, may wake up this week to find out from one of his top advisors that he&#x27;s now a China hawk.


That is, if you ask Kurt Campbell, the U.S. coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs on the National Security Council. 


Campbell said this week that the U.S. was &quot;entering a period of intense competition with China as the government running the world’s second-biggest economy becomes ever more tightly controlled by President Xi Jinping,&quot; according to Bloomberg.

Criminals who repeatedly targeted an auto shop in Spring Lake, North Carolina by leaving racist graffiti referencing the KKK and Nazis turned out to be two African-American men after the owner caught them on camera.







Business owner Dwyane Haynesworth (who is black) took action after having a car stole off his lot and then discovering the racist graffiti, which included a drawing of a swastika.


After setting up the security cameras, that same night the criminals returned and broke into more vehicles before smashing windows and attempting to hot wire one of the cars.

We knew it would be a crazy day for today&#x27;s reverse repo early this morning, when the overnight GCF repo rate traded at -0.01% and refused to rise, an indication that there was far too much money chasing good collateral.







Looking at the scramble for repo, interbroker dealer Wrightson ICAP said on Thursday morning that it saw Reverse Repo volumes rising to around $470 billion Thursday, though the risks are “still tilted to the high side.”


They were, because moments ago the Fed announced that at 1:15pm some 50 counterparties (up from 46 on Wednesday) parked $485.329BN in reserves with the Fed (in exchange for the generous rate of 0.000%), which was up $35BN overnight, up $134BN in the past wee…</span>

By many accounts what was somewhat already a &quot;norm&quot; under American sanctions has come early this year - namely the sporadic blackouts, increasingly angering the population just ahead of a key presidential election in June.

                    <span>Dutch Court Orders Shell To Aggressively Cut Carbon Emissions In Landmark Decision

            
There&#x27;s been a lot of speculation this year about what it might take for western governments like the US to meet the carbon emissions targets laid out in the Paris Accords, which President Biden has enthusiastically rejoined. One study by the IEA concluded that all oil and gas firms would have to halt new projects in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.


While progressives increasingly demand more aggressive change, moderate Democrats and Republicans have long insisted that markets would naturally wean society off of its dependence on fossil fuels as renewables, nuclear and other alternatives to fossil fuel become more affordable. As COVID led to a memorable drop in demand that sen…</span>

                    <span>Facebook Stops Removing Posts Claiming COVID-19 Man-Made After Lab-Leak Hypothesis Finally Goes Mainstream

            
After nearly 18 months of punishing anyone who suggested that COVID-19 might have originated in a Wuhan lab, Facebook has decided to stop removing posts which claim the virus was man-made or manufactured, a company spokesperson told Politico on Wednesday.







The move comes after the Wall Street Journal reported that three lab workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were hospitalized in late 2019 with symptoms consistent with the virus - building on previous reporting by the Washington Post&#x27;s Josh Rogin. Both articles cast doubt on the mainstream media&#x27;s unsupported claim that COVID-19 jumped from bats to humans through an intermediary species - as opposed to…</span>

Authored by Mark Glennon via Wirepoints.org,


Most Illinoisans are unaware, but their General Assembly is poised to pass a resolution for a state constitutional amendment, the consequences of which are hard to overstate. It would vastly expand union power, permanently, particularly public union power that is already extreme.







Limited media coverage so far characterizes the amendment mostly as an attempt to permanently ban right-to-work and lock in current worker protections. That would be bad enough, since the majority of states are now right to work including nearby competitors Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana and Iowa. And Illinois is already an outlier in how much power it has given to …</span>

The calm of a sunny May afternoon in Taiwan was broken by what the Nikkei describes as a crescendo of smartphones buzzing due to a national emergency alert: electricity blackouts were coming due to a malfunction at a power plant in the south of the island. People had no time to prepare. There were more than 30 reports of people being trapped in elevators half an hour after the warning in the capital city.


&quot;I was talking to my clients... but our building suddenly blacked out. The air conditioning as well as WiFi crashed completely, so I went home early,&quot; a manager with the surname of Lin working in the Neihu Science Park in Taipei, where many top tech companies have offices, told Nikkei …</span>

                    <span>Are Chinese Stocks Ready To Outperform?

            
By Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at SaxoBank


Summary: Chinese equities were rallying 3.6% today on signals from the Chinese government to curb inflationary pressures from rising commodity markets reducing inflation expectations and boosting the earnings outlook. US equities are currently valued at a valuation premium to Chinese equities which suggest historically that Chinese equities could outperform over the next 26 weeks. The two country&#x27;s technology sectors are equally valued on a 2-year forward basis on EV/EBITDA but with a valuation skew on Chinese technology mega caps making them more attractive on valuation. The long-term growth outlook is better for Chinese technology companies and thus we expect the market to beg…</span>

While many of the SPACs he has sponsored have seen less than stellar returns, Chamath Palihapitiya and his VC firm, Social Capital, are doing just fine.  Palihapitiya has been a player in Silicon Valley for years, but thanks to the SPAC boom, 2020 was a breakout year for the former Facebook employee. Not only did he rake in profits for his firm and his investors, but SPACs have changed the nature of the IPO process







Somewhat lost in all the excitement of the SPAC boom is the fact that Social Capital is a VC firm that has invested in more than 70 companies during the past decade, which has been a lucrative one for Silicon Valley. Social Capi…</span>

Authored by Liam Brooks via AmericanThinker.com,


Teen climate zealot Greta Thunberg raised some eyebrows last week when she tossed an f-bomb in a video she posted Saturday to commemorate the International Day of Biological Diversity. (Something I&#x27;ve admittedly never heard of.) 



&quot;Our relationship with nature is broken,&quot; Saint Greta flatly stated.


&quot;But relationships can change. If we don&#x27;t change, we are f**ked.&quot;




”Our relationship with nature is broken. But relationships can change. When we protect nature - we are nature protecting itself.”

                    <span>&quot;Rescue Operation Underway&quot; - Boat With 200 Passengers Sinks In Nigeria

            
Dozens of people are missing in north-western Nigeria after a boat carrying 200 capsized on Wednesday, according to Reuters, citing a state spokesperson.



&quot;The boat was ferrying about 200 passengers&quot; coming from the neighboring country of Niger, said Yahaya Sarki, a spokesperson for the governor of Kebbi.


&quot;Their locally made wooden boat capsized mid-water,&quot; Sarki said. &quot;Bodies are still being recovered. We can&#x27;t ascertain the number for now.&quot;



The boat was reportedly overloaded when it suddenly snapped into two in the middle of the Niger River. 







Reports of how many people on board vary from news agency to news agency—some say between 160 and 200.


Authorities in Kebbi State told the BBC that first responders had been dispatched to the scene to search for survivors. 



&quot;A rescue operation is underway, but only 22 survivors and one dead body have been recovered,&quot; a local official reportedly said.



Qasimu Umar Wara, a resident of Wara town, told Reuters the passengers were returning from a newly-discovered gold vein in Niger. 



&quot;They usually go there in the evenings and return to Wara in the morning,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of them are petty traders, food vendors and the local miners.&quot;



The wooden boat is reportedly rated for 80 passengers, and the accident is likely due to overloading.

Since Bill and Melinda Gates first announced their divorce earlier this month, barely a day has passed without some unflattering new revelation, as the American media apparently scrambles to compensate for all those years where it treated Bill Gates with kid gloves.


It&#x27;s bad enough that Melinda reportedly divorced Bill over his insistence on maintaining ties with Jeffrey Epstein, something that has stoked speculation about whether Gates might face more sexual harassment allegations (sure enough, reports have emerged claiming he was essentially pushed out at Microsoft over improper behavior involving a female subordinate) or that he might be caught up in the…</span>

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Following calls last summer from groups such as Black Lives Matter to “defund the police,” a number of city officials are now walking back statements to go through with cutting funding to law enforcement due to surges in crime levels.


The Minneapolis City Council several months ago voted to approve $6.4 million more in funding to the police department, coming after a number of councilmembers last year pledged to completely abolish the department.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


A professor with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine has said that there is a general dismissal of the fact that more than half of all Americans have developed natural immunity to the coronavirus and that it constitutes “one of the biggest failures of our current medical leadership.”







Dr. Marty Makary made the comments during a recent interview, noting that “natural immunity works” and it is wrong to vilify those who don’t want the vaccine because they have already recovered from the virus.

Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


According to a report from The New York Times, US troops are expected to be out of Afghanistan by early to mid-July, well before the September 11th deadline set by President Biden.


Unnamed US officials told the Times that Washington’s allies are also expected to be out by July, although Germany is apparently struggling to keep up the pace. US Central Command on Tuesday said the Afghanistan withdrawal process was about 16 to 25 percent complete.

                    <span>&quot;Change Is Coming&quot; - Engine No. 1 Wins Two Exxon Board Seats  

            
Activist firm Engine No. 1 has won at least two seats on the board of Exxon Mobile Corp. following a multi-month battle over the oil giant&#x27;s board of directors to change the company&#x27;s path towards one centered around achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner, according to WSJ.







Engine No. 1, an upstart hedge fund, owns a tiny 0.02% stake in Exxon, has gone on a blitz against the company since December to shift away from fossil fuels to a zero-carbon world. The fund was founded by veteran hedge fund investor Chris James.

Just a few weeks ago, the market was rife with speculation that amid galloping inflation, the Fed would almost certainly breach the topic of the infamous taper during its June 16 FOMC meeting, and if not then, then no later than the September 22 meeting, which takes place just after the late-August Jackson Hole central banker outing in which most of the Fed&#x27;s &quot;radical&quot; ideas in the past decade have been introduced.


Not any more.

Five people were arrested overnight in Portland, Oregon after a riot broke out on the anniversary of George Floyd’s death.


The quintet was part of a crowd who set a fire in a dumpster next to the Justice Center, a building that houses a jail and law enforcement offices, while chanting “Burn the building down,” according to a Portland Police Bureau incident summary and photographs and video footage from the scene.

Authored by Stephen Roach via Project-Syndicate,


The US Federal Reserve is insisting that recent increases in the price of food, construction materials, used cars, personal health products, gasoline, and appliances reflect transitory factors that will quickly fade with post-pandemic normalization. But what if they are a harbinger, not a &quot;noisy&quot; deviation?







Memories can be tricky. I have long been haunted by the inflation of the 1970s.

Amid the fifth and what&#x27;s expected to be the final round of Iran nuclear talks in Vienna, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has voiced that time is running out on reaching an agreement given the Islamic Republic has already reached bomb-building capability in terms of enriched uranium purity levels. 


IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told Financial Times that Iran has reached uranium purity levels that &quot;only countries making bombs are reaching&quot; after routinely ramping up enrichment since Trump pulled out of the Obama-era JCPOA back in May 2018.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


The long-awaited, though partial, release of a memorandum from the Justice Department this week left many “frustrated,” as predicted by the Washington Post, in Washington. The reason is what it did not contain.  Critics had sought the memo as the “smoking gun” to show how former Attorney General Bill Barr scuttled any obstruction charges against Donald Trump.


Instead, the memo showed the opposite. 







The staff of the OLC actually found that the allegations did not meet the standard of obstruction even without any defenses or privileges related to Trump’s office.

                    <span>It Reeks Of Deflation After Second Stellar Treasury Auction In A Row

            
After yesterday&#x27;s blockbuster 2Y auction which pushed bond yields sharply lower and which we said was an indication that the inflationary storm has passed with bond traders no longer expecting any rate hikes for the foreseeable future, moments ago the stench of deflation was positively rancid after today&#x27;s $61BN 5-Year auction was just as almost as solid as Tuesday&#x27;s auction.


Printing at a high yield of 0.788%, the 2Y auction stopped 5.5bps below April&#x27;s auction and also stopped through the When Issued 0.794% by 0.6bps, the first stop through for the tenor since Jan 2021.


Meanwhile, and like yesterday, the Bid to Cover jumped, rising from 2.31 last month to 2.49 today, the highest since Sept 2020 and obviously well above the six-auction average of 2.34.


The internals were also stellar with Indirects taking down a whopping 64.4%, the highest foreign award since August 2020 and far above the 57.9% recent average. And with Directs taking down a lower than average 14.9%, Dealers were left holding 20.8% of the auction, the lowest since August.







Overall, a stellar bond auction, and one which together with yesterday&#x27;s 2Y auction suggests that demand for tomorrow&#x27;s 7Y issuance will be vastly greater compared to the dismal 7Y bond sale in late February when the bellybuster auction was nearly a flop and sparked a major bond and stock market selloff.

by Robert Dalheim of Woodworking Network







The U.S. Department of Commerce says it will seek to double tariff rates on most Canadian softwood lumber, angering home builders. New rates vary by company. West Fraser goes from 9 percent to 11.4 percent, Canfor from 4.6 to 21 percent, Resolute Forest from 20.3 to 30.2 percent, and J.D. Irving from 4.2 to 15.8 percent.


The overall increase is from 9 percent to 18.32 percent.


Home builders, who had been urging for a removal of tariffs, expressed their disappointment.


“At a time when soaring lumber prices have added nearly $36,000 to the price of a new home and priced millions of middle class households out of the housing …</span>

In a rare and refreshing interview which on YouTube has garnered 100,000 views in less than 24 hours, British comedian and actor Russell Brand and former Intercept journalist Glenn Greenwald teamed up to explain last year&#x27;s scandalous coordination by the mainstream media and social media companies to ensure the Hunter Biden laptop story and accompanying revelations over the Hunter-Ukrainian Burisma energy company scandal never reached broader public view.

Authored by Janita Kan via The Epoch Times,


Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on Monday said he was willing to support a Democrat-led bill that was passed by the House to create an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 breach of the U.S. Capitol.







Romney answered that he “would support the bill” when asked by reporters how he would vote if Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) starts a debate on the House bill, according to multiple congressional reporters. He is the first Republican in the Senate to do so.


The Utah senator’s comments come on the same day that Schumer vowed to bring the bill for a vote on the Senate floor.

Last week&#x27;s good news of easing vessel congestion earlier this month outside the busiest U.S. gateway for trade with Asia showed a glimmer of hope that supply chain disruptions could subside had flipped last week as more containerships join the queue.  


Bloomberg data shows the number of containerships queuing off the coast of Los Angeles reached the highest in two weeks.


As of Sunday, 21 containerships were anchored waiting for entry into L.A.-Long Beach, compared with 19 a week earlier. The bottleneck peaked at around 40 vessels in the queue in early February and has steadily declined ever since, but the latest data shows progress could be reversing.

Authored by John Tamny via RealClear Markets (emphasis ours),


If you want to act in movies or on television in Hollywood, you must be a member of the Screen Actors Guild. That’s why the accession of a “SAG” card is such a momentous achievement for actors. It means they’re Hollywood legal as it were.







So why does acting professionally require union membership? The answer is very simple: SAG wants to prevent those yearning to be stars from flooding the market, and subsequently bidding starting wages down to zero.


It’s as old as the hills for actors and actresses to wistfully proclaim that “I just want a chance to show them what I can do.” Since they’re all looking for a break, it’s not unreasonable to specula…</span>

After by the end of last year New York City&#x27;s beleaguered subways fell to carrying a mere 30% of pre-pandemic volumes but also as vandalism and random violent attacks soared, sparking widespread concern over safety, officials with the state&#x27;s Metropolitan Transportation Authority are now looking to spend $2.2 million a month on private security guards, a recent Wall Street Journal report confirmed.


By month&#x27;s end some 200 private guards are expected to be present at stations and on trains, which is double what it&#x27;s been in prior months - after the MTA urged more city police amid rising crime in areas of the transit system where there&#x27;s often near-deserted platforms given the prior COVI…</span>

Op-Ed Authored by Roger Kimball via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),


I cannot identify who exactly popularized the term “woke.”


But I’ve had cause to wheel it out here and elsewhere on and off for the past few years, generally when describing some absurd piece of academic or corporate or government obeisance to political correctness.

                    <span>Goldman Wins Regulatory Approval To Launch Chinese Wealth Management Business

            
Ever since China started allowing American money managers access to the hundreds of millions of middle class Chinese investors and savers via &quot;joint ventures&quot; with domestic firms, some of the biggest US buy-side firms, including BlackRock and Vanguard, have already launched their Chinese operations.


And now, after months of cajoling local regulators, it appears Goldman Sachs has just won approval to launch a wealth management venture of its own alongside ICBC, one of China&#x27;s largest banks, the FT says.


So pretty soon, the Chinese elite will have the opportunity to join their American peers by becoming Goldman clients.

Authored by Jonathan Maze via RestaurantBusinessOnline.com,


Subway franchisees recently started pushing the company to dramatically reduce the ongoing fees they pay the company in a bid to keep more of them in business.







But Subway is moving in the other direction. The sandwich giant’s newest franchise agreement increases their ongoing royalty payments by 25%, numerous sources told Restaurant Business. The result would send higher what many say is an already unusually high royalty rate at a time when the chain is closing more than 1,000 locations a year.


Currently, the Milford, Conn.-based franchisor charges operators a base royalty of 8% of a store’s revenue—or $8 for every $100 in sales a location generat…</span>

                    <span>Elizabeth Warren Wants To Ban Lawmakers From Trading Individual Stocks

            
Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wants to end what is effectively legalized insider trading by members of Congress by barring them from trading individual stocks ever again.







Warren first attempted to push through similar legislation with the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act she introduced in 2018 and then again in 2020. Both bills unsurprisingly died in the Senate Finance Committee, which Warren sits on.


The renewed push comes as several members of Congress have come under recent scrutiny for profitable stock trades in recent months, according to Business Insider. The include Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC), Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) and former Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler…</span>

Authored by Mark Glennon via Wirepoints.org,


“Beliefs aren’t facts.” 


That would be an unremarkable title for an unremarkable column except for who wrote it. In a new column in Persuasion, Northwestern University President Morton Schapiro took on the illiberal tyranny that permeates most of higher education.


Schapiro, you may remember, is the one who told his incoming freshmen to “look for safe spaces” and pledged that “if you can’t find them, we will help you find them.” Regarding traumatic ideas, Schapiro said, “If they say that…you shouldn’t be warned to prepare yourself psychologically for that, that somehow that’s coddling, those people are lunatics.” As for micr…</span>

                    <span>WTI Bounces Back Above $66 After Inventory Draws Across Entire Complex

            
Oil prices ended marginally lower after a choppy day of investors tempering expectations of an early return of oil exporter Iran to international crude markets (bullish) and US virus cases falling rapidly ahead of Memorial Day travels (bullish) battling with the overall weakness in economic data and slop in US equity markets and lower bond yields (bearish).



&quot;Oil prices... remain at high levels as the high season for oil demand is approaching and as restrictions are lifted in much of Europe and the United States,&quot; said Louise Dickson, oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy.



The swings in crude and product stocks in the last couple of weeks have been noisy thanks to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown. This week we should start to put that behind us, although product stocks may still be impacted.


API




	
Crude -439k (-1mm exp)

	

	

	
Cushing -1.153mm

	

	

	
Gasoline -1.986mm (-1.1mm exp)

	

	

	
Distillates -5.137mm (-2mm exp)

	


Analysts expected inventory draws across the board this week, and they were right with Gasoline stocks down notably more than expected for the 7th straight week...

WTI hovered around $65.90 ahead of the API data and pushed back above $66 after the print.








&quot;Crude prices are in wait-and-see mode until the fifth round of negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal are done,&quot; said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, noting &quot;Energy traders need to know how much Iranian crude is going to hit the market.&quot;



Iran may have some 69 million barrels of oil in floating storage waiting on tankers to travel to buyers when U.S. sanctions on its crude oil exports are removed, estimates from E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers cited by Bloomberg showed on Tuesday.

The day started off with an exuberant buying-panic in Small Caps at the US cash open (as the rest of the majors were sold). That lasted around 12 minutes before Small Caps reversed that maniacal spike and everything accelerated into the red and beyond into the European close. A brief bounce ensued, only for that rip to be sold and as the old &quot;WSB&quot; names started to rise, so Small Caps and the rest of the major indices tumbled in the last hour. Nasdaq managed to close green, none of the other majors did with Small Caps the laggards (from up 1% at the open to down 1% at the close)

Authored by Ron Paul via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace &amp; Prosperity,


In March, Governor Greg Abbott announced that Texas would open for business 100 percent without a statewide mask mandate. 







The pro-lockdown “experts” were shocked. If a state as big as Texas joined Florida and succeeded in thumbing its nose at “the science” – which told us that for the first time in history healthy people should be forced to stay in their houses and wear oxygen-restricting face masks – then the lockdown narrative would begin falling apart.


President Biden famously attacked the decision as “Neanderthal thinking.” Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa warned that, with this order, Abbott would “kill Texans.” Incoming CDC Dire…</span>

SPACs have officially fallen out of favor. 


The SPAC bubble burst started with fallen angel Nikola Motors and has since continued, with short sellers and market skeptics unveiling the less than savory elements to numerous names brought public through the merger-style transaction that allows companies to go public quicker, and with less red tape, than the traditional IPO process.


Chamath Palihapitiya, once heralded as the &quot;king of SPACs&quot; is now more likely to be seen as the face of a SPAC bubble that looks as though it is in the process of popping. 


As a result of the bubble bursting, banks are starting to &quot;pass&quot; on funding SPAC transactions. One recent example was Si…</span>

Don&#x27;t look now but the meme stocks are back.

... and AMC close behind, up 14%.







The move may be a ramp in sympathy because while GME short interest is a pale shadow of its former glorious self...

Secretary of State Antony Blinken&#x27;s Mideast trip where he first met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Tuesday was supposed to focus on maintaining the Israel-Gaza truce and finding a lasting solution toward preventing a future flair up of violence. 


However, an emboldened Netanyahu bluntly shared his thoughts on the impending restoration of the Iran nuclear deal while standing next to Blinken during the press conference that followed their meeting. As expected Netanyahu urged the US to stay away from the deal, forcing Blinken to quickly contradict the Israeli leader, leading to an awkward exchange among the close allies. It took a mere 90 seconds for Netanyahu…</span>

It seems that every time something adverse happens in the labor market, it restarts the partisan battle between those currently in and out of power as to who is a better steward of the economy.







That was illustrated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics&#x27;s (BLS) release of the job numbers for April, which made headlines when job growth, which was expected to surge, came in “unexpectedly” low. The 266,000 jobs created were only a quarter of some forecasts, which topped 1 million. Further, March job creation was also revised down by 146,000. And unemployment ticked up for the first time since the lockdown, despite a reportedly massive shortage of workers, as illustrated b…</span>

At an event outside a US Micron Technology Inc chip factory on Monday, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told an audience that a proposed bill on Capitol Hill for $52 billion could bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing by funding seven to 10 new US factories, according to Reuters.







Raimondo told the audience in a tented event outside of Micron&#x27;s Manassas, Virginia, chip factory that she expects the $52 billion proposal to enhance US competitiveness with China would generate &quot;$150 billion-plus&quot; in investment for chip manufacturing and research from state and federal governments and private-sector firms.

What Belarus did, while illegal, is not unprecedented. The dangerous tactic was pioneered by the same U.S. and E.U. officials now righteously condemning it...

Let&#x27;s explore quantum computing, problems it might solve, and what it will do to current security protocols and blockchain.







What is a Quantum Computer?


The New Scientist answers the question What is a Quantum Computer?



Classical computers, which include smartphones and laptops, encode information in binary “bits” that can either be 0s or 1s. In a quantum computer, the basic unit of memory is a quantum bit or qubit.


For instance, eight bits is enough for a classical computer to represent any number between 0 and 255. But eight qubits is enough for a quantum computer to represent every number between 0 and 255 at the same…</span>

What started as a birthday party in Huntington Beach, California, quickly descended into chaos over the weekend. 


A TikTok video promoting a birthday party went viral, and thousands of people showed up on the beach and in the streets Saturday night. Riot police were called as the unruly crowd launched fireworks and threw rocks and bottles. An emergency curfew was implemented through early Sunday with 150 arrests. 







A TikTok post (now taken down) called Adrian&#x27;s Kickback by user &quot;adrian.lopez517&quot; swelled to more than 2,500 people on Saturday night. In the days before the meetup, the post went absolutely viral, gaining more than 200 million views on the app.

&quot;In real terms, home prices have never been so high. My data goes back over 100 years, so this is something,&quot; Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller told CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Trading Nation.&quot; 


Shiller is the co-founder of the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price index. He is worried about a housing bubble forming where the &quot;Wild West&quot; mentality pushes prices higher. He also is concerned about stocks and cryptocurrencies.







 &quot;I don&#x27;t think that the whole thing is explained by central bank policy. There is something about the sociology of markets that are happening,&quot; he said.

The news business just can’t stop clowning itself. The latest indignity is an international fact-checking debacle originating, of all places, at a “festival of fact-checking.”

The Poynter Institute is perhaps the most respected think tank in our business, an organization seeking to “fortify journalism’s role in a free society,” among other things through its sponsorship of the fact-checking outlet PolitiFact. A few weeks back, it held a virtual convention called the “United Facts of America: A Festival of Fact-Checking.”

There was a ton of hype last week when Ford Motor Company unveiled its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck. As of Friday, Ford secured more than 44,000 reservations for the new truck. 


Ford&#x27;s first all-electric truck is expected to have a targeted range between 230 and 300 miles depending on the version the customer chooses. Ford said the truck could haul up to 10,000 pounds. 







Auto blog Jalopnik points out that Ford failed to release data on how hauling or towing would affect range last week. 


In an emailed response, Vice News had a similar question and asked a Ford spokeswoman.

                    <span>Support For Black Lives Matter Drops To Two Year Low

            
Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


Despite relentless positive promotion by the media and political elites, support for Black Lives Matter in America has dropped to a two year low.







An essay written by academics Jennifer Chudy and Hakeem Jefferson published by the New York Times analyzes how support for BLM soared to +20% in mid-2020 but rapidly dropped to only +5% – which is where it was in mid-2019.


The authors note that the figures serve to contradict “the idea that the country underwent a racial reckoning.”

Via Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com,


Economist John Williams, founder of ShadowStats.com, says the Federal Reserve has painted itself into such a tight corner with the economy it really has only two choices.  Williams says it comes down to “Inflation or Implosion.”







What would happen to the financial system if the Fed stopped printing massive amounts of money for stimulus and debt service?  Williams explains,



“You could see financial implosion by preventing liquidity being put into the system.  The system needs liquidity (freshly created dollars) to function. Without that liquidity, you would see more of an economic implosion than you have already seen.  In fact, I will contend that…</span>

                    <span>&#x27;Devout Catholic&#x27; Biden Bails On Notre Dame Commencement After 1000s Sign Petition Demanding No Invite

            
President Biden, a self-described &#x27;devout Catholic,&#x27; will become the first US official in two decades not to attend Notre Dame&#x27;s commencement ceremony, citing a &#x27;scheduling conflict&#x27; according to the Catholic News Agency.







The news comes after 4,600 &quot;members of the Notre Dame community&quot; signed a petition urging college president Fr. John Jenkins not to invite Biden - the second Roman Catholic president, over his stance on abortion, according to Fox News. Of note, Biden was told in February by US Archbishop Joseph Naumann to stop calling himself a &#x27;devout catholic&#x27; over his pro-abortion views.

Thanks to its very name - renewable energy - we can picture a time in the not-too-distant future when our need for non-renewable fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal will vanish. Indeed, the Biden administration has announced a breakthrough target of 2035 for fully eliminating U.S. reliance on those non-renewable fuels for the generation of electricity. That would be accomplished by “deploying carbon-pollution-free electricity-generating resources,” primarily the everlasting power of the wind and sun.


With other nations moving in a similar direction, it’s tempting to conclude that the days when competition over finite supplies of energy was a recurring so…</span>

There&#x27;s a lot of noise from the Biden administration, who claim to be addressing gun violence as an epidemic, but their efforts have only been for optics, as very little action has been taken so far. This past weekend, a dozen mass shootings were recorded across the country, according to CNN. 


Nonprofit research group Gun Violence Archive (GVA) reported that at least 12 mass shootings were observed in eight states, including Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia, Texas, and Minnesota.



This is the second straight year that the month of May has had 60+ mass shootings. https://t.co/xUBTCOf9xW

Left-wing website website Vox has been caught stealth editing an old article from March 2020 “debunking” the lab origin of COVID following numerous prominent officials now saying the lab origin is a distinct possibility.

Writer and investor Paul Graham documented the edits, tweeting, “Some of the stealth edits that Vox made to its article debunking “conspiracy theories” that Covid-19 originated in a lab leak between its original publication in March 2020 and now.”

A growing number of European carriers, including all airlines based in the United Kingdom, are now avoiding entry into Belarus&#x27; airspace following Sunday&#x27;s dramatic events involving the diversion of a Ryanair flight carrying Belarusian opposition journalist Roman Pratasevich.


The BBC is confirming that &quot;The UK government has told airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace after a Ryanair flight was diverted to Minsk and an opposition journalist arrested.&quot; The government said this is necessary &quot;to keep passengers safe&quot;.

Below is my column in The Hill on the recent decision of a federal judge that the Biden Administration was engaged in racial and gender discrimination in the administration of the pandemic relief under the American Rescue Plan Act. It is a question that is now being raised in a variety of federal programs under the Biden Administration.







President Biden has spoken out often, eloquently and passionately against the “ugly poison” of discrimination and racism in our government. So a ruling by a federal district court in Texas this week was particularly jarring: Judge Reed O’Connor found that the Biden administration engaged…</span>

Via SchiffGold.com,


Inflation came in hot in April. Initially gold sold off on the news. But over the following week, there appears to have been something of a pivot in the market. Gold and the dollar both started behaving as one would expect in an inflationary environment. Peter Schiff said it looks like investors are starting to worry the Fed won’t fight inflation after all.







The markets have been by and large operating on the assumption that the Fed would stick to its playbook and tighten monetary policy to deal with increasing consumer prices. But Peter has been saying there is no way the Fed could fight inflation if it wants to. Inflation is propping up the economy. If the Fed raised rates and…</span>

Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,


The Biden Administration is discussing hiking corporate taxes to pay for the proposed infrastructure spending package. While the goal is to ensure the “rich pay their fair share,” a look at history suggests changing tax rates will have very little impact on economic outcomes.


Leading up to, and following, the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Trump Tax Cuts) I wrote a lot of analysis on:




	
The fallacy of tax cuts,

	

	

	
Why tax cuts wouldn’t change corporate behavior; and,

	

	

	
How tax cuts are an ineffective method of improving economic prosperity.

	


What we know now, is that our analysis was correct. As noted, corporate behavi…</span>

                    <span>New York City Is Back: At Least 30 People Shot Over The Weekend

            
New York City is officially back: almost 30 people were shot in New York City this past weekend - and that number was only up until about 2PM on Sunday. 


29 victims in total had been struck by gunfire by early evening Sunday, according to the New York Post, with one reported fatality. 


“These kids are having running gun battles and innocents are getting shot,” one veteran NYPD officer told the Post. “Nobody is interested in hearing how many shots are fired but if people knew how many shootings occurred where there are no victims — it’s by the grace of God.&quot;


Among those struck by gunfire over the weekend were a Manhattan federal prosecutor, Mollie Bracewell, who was dining outside in Brooklyn’s Prospect Heights, and Benjamin Bustamante, an innocent bystander walking nearby. 







The weekend hadn&#x27;t even ended before one officer said &quot;there were just two more right now&quot;, referring to additional shootings late Sunday. 


Shootings took place at Beach 30th Street and Seagirt Boulevard in Far Rockaway, Queens, among other locations throughout the city.


Two people were shot in that area after a &quot;gang dispute&quot; spilled out of a nearby park, the report says. 


And if &quot;diversity&quot; in your violent crimes is a major concern, as we know it probably is for Mayor De Blasio, it should be noted that in addition to the shootings, there was a fatal stabbing in Northern Brooklyn and a man who was beaten to death in the Northeast Bronx over the weekend as well.

Submitted by Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research


The inflation of the 1970s/early 1980s is a big topic just now, but a deep dive into the historical CPI data shows the world was very different then. The CPI peak in 1974 felt awful because food/clothing was 33 pct of the index and prices were up 8-12 pct. Those items are just 14 pct of CPI now. May 1980’s 13-14 pct CPI inflation was driven by high mortgage rates, no longer even used in CPI. Bottom line: look forward, not backwards, and consider energy stocks, gold, “B”, and even US stocks as inflation hedges.


&quot;You don’t know how to think about inflation unless you lived through the 1970s.&quot; We see that comment a lot these days and can’t help but smile. I (Nick) do vividly remember in…</span>

During today&#x27;s CoinDesk Consensus 2021 Conference, Ray Dalio said that not only would he rather own bitcoin than bonds - and for the world&#x27;s largest risk parity hedge fund which traditionally hedges its equity exposure using a balanced 60/40 bond/stock split that&#x27;s saying a lot - but putting all doubt to rest, he said that &quot;I have some bitcoin.&quot;

Ahead of today&#x27;s 1:15pm overnight Reverse Repo deadline we asked if today is the day the repo market finallys crack, pushing the amount of reserves parked at the Fed to a new record above $500 billion.



Are we going to hit half a T in RRP today

— zerohedge (@zerohedge) May 24, 2021


We were off, but not by too much: on Monday, the Fed revealed that the amount of overnight reserves parked at the Fed rose by another $26BN to $394.9BN (with 54 counteparties) from $369BN (52 counteparties) on Friday, which was the 5th highest in history, up a whopping $186 billion in one week and the highest non-quarter end reverse repo usage ever!

Real Vision managing editor Ed Harrison and editor Jack Farley break down today’s most important market-moving stories—from China’s clampdown on commodity speculation and Bitcoin mining to the supply chain bottlenecks that may at last spur durable capex investment from companies in order to meet demand. Harrison and Farley cover the day’s price action in which global equities drift higher alongside commodities such as gold and crude oil as well as the crypto volatility, which did not abate over the weekend.

Update (1340ET): Shortly after the warnings from Masa-san and news (below) of Japan&#x27;s push for a amass vaccination program, the US State Department has cranked up the pressure to &#x27;11&#x27; by issuing a Level 4 Travel Advisory for visitors to Japan.


&quot;Do not travel to Japan due to COVID-19.&quot;







The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 4 Travel Health Notice for Japan due to COVID-19, indicating a very high level of COVID-19 in the country. There are restrictions in place affecting U.S. citizen entry into Japan. Visit the Embassy&#x27;s COVID-19 page for more information on COVID-19 in Japan.

Back in December, vol-specialist hedge fund One River Asset Management surprised its peers when long before Elon Musk arrived on  the scene, it became one of the first major asset managers to disclose it had purchased $600 million in bitcoin and ethereum and said it would own more than $1 billion in cryptos in early 2021. It wasn&#x27;t along in this pioneering effort: Brevan Howard Asset Management co-founder Alan Howard had taken an ownership stake in One River Digital and was helping provide the company with backend trading services. Another prominent backer was British hedge fund Ruffer, which last December also revealed that 2.5% of its total AUM were in bitcoin.

                    <span>David Rosenberg: &quot;A Whole Bunch Of People Are Really, Really Wrong&quot; About Inflation

            
With so much focus on the macro environment as stocks struggle to return to their all-time highs, MacroVoices invited seasoned Wall Street economist David Rosenberg, the chief economist and chief strategist of Rosenberg Research, on the show this week to discus the market&#x27;s topic du jour: inflation, and whether or not it will be &quot;transitory,&quot; like the Federal Reserve says.


What followed was a thorough critique from Rosenberg, who just a couple of months ago was warning that rising Treasury yields would soon push the market to a &quot;breaking point,&quot; of what he sees as flaws in the market&#x27;s pricing of lasting inflationary pressures.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced this weekend that he will not get vaccinated against COVID-19, explaining that he already contracted the virus last year and has “natural immunity.”







Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, said that he has not seen evidence proving the vaccine is more effective than having survived the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, otherwise known as the novel coronavirus, so he won’t get the shot.



“Until they show me evidence that people who have already had the infection are dying in large numbers, or being hospitalized or getting very sick, I just made my own personal decision that I’m not getting vaccinated because I’ve al…</span>

Confirming that &quot;selling in May&quot; is there for a reason, virtually every bank has turned cautious if not outright downbeat on the market following a blockbuster earnings season when despite record earnings beats, the S&amp;P is down compared to where it was a month ago. So now that Wall Street is back to its favorite activity of &quot;explaining&quot; events after the fact, here is Goldman strategist Chris Hussey listing the three key &quot;grey rhino&quot; events the market is grappling with.


As Hussey writes in the &quot;end of week&quot; market intel note, &quot;gray rhino&quot; risks have proliferated around markets this week, helping to sustain the tepid return range that the S&amp;P 500 has been stuck in all of May (now down 0.2% mtd). Incidentally, for t…</span>

The world’s worst disaster in a century killed 7.1mm-12.7mm across the planet. The total continued rising. No one knew exactly when it would end, only that the poorest nations would bear the brunt. They always do. European and Asian countries lost more citizens than they had since WWII. The US lost more than in any war. Children fell behind. Economic costs spiraled, leaving each nation’s finances forever changed. Monetary and fiscal policy merged in the West. Inflation reappeared. Despots tightened their grip. America’s president was voted out.

                    <span>&quot;Air&#x27;s Coming Out Of The Balloon&quot; - Redfin CEO Says Home Price Gains Set To Cool

            
Glenn Kelman, CEO at Redfin, spoke with Bloomberg Radio&#x27;s Denise Pellegrini on Wednesday about the state of the US housing market. He said the latest surge in home prices could subside. 


Kelman said the housing market is a frenzy, with most houses selling above the asking prices, which has never happened before. 


After record gains in the first quarter, some home prices are likely to stall. 


Nationwide, the median existing-home sales price rose 16.2% in the first quarter to $319,200, a record high in data going back to 1989, according to the National Association of Realtors.

                    <span>Apples-to-Apples, Consumer Price Inflation Is Nearing 1970-Type Numbers

            
By Joseph Carson, former chief economist at Alliance Bernstein


Apples-to-apples, consumer price inflation nowadays is running close to the high inflation readings of the late 1970s. That should be a red flag for policymakers as monetary decisions are focused on actual outcomes, not forecasted. But reported inflation statistics do not show the 1970s inflation-style inflation because they no longer include actual house prices.


The old consumer price index included house prices in measuring the owner&#x27;s housing cost, whereas the present-day price index base owners&#x27; housing cost on an arbitrary, non-market rent measure. The only way to make a price series strictly comparable over time is to use the s…</span>

Three researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were so sick in November of 2019 that they sought hospitalization, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing a previously undisclosed US intelligence report &quot;that could add weight to growing calls for a fuller probe of whether the COVID-19 virus may have escaped from the laboratory.&quot;

All Gas, No Brakes


The weather in London this week has been rainy while sunny, which feels like a fair description of current sentiment, as we’ve been discussing our mid-year outlook with investors this week. There’s a wide range of views out there at the moment, with the noisiness of the data giving everyone something to hang their hat on. In short, it’s the perfect time to step back and debate the longer-term outlook.


The most notable aspect of our forecasts, and one of the most contentious areas of debate, is just how much our expectations differ from the prior decade. The post-GFC period was defined by fiscal aust…</span>

                    <span>Fauci Finally Admits COVID-19 May Have Come From Wuhan Lab, &#x27;Not Convinced&#x27; Of Natural Origin

            
Earlier this month, just hours after Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) dragged Anthony Fauci over pandemic misinformation - and the fact that Fauci&#x27;s NIH funded risky collaborations at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - the nation&#x27;s top virologist (and highest-paid government employee) furiously backpedaled over the origins of the pandemic in what we can only assume was an effort to redirect attention from his own culpability.







Recall that since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, Fauci parroted CCP talking points - insisting that the virus couldn&#x27;t possibly have come from a Chinese lab.

Authored by Tom Luongo via Gold, Goats, &#x27;n Guns blog,


Last week both Martin Armstrong and Alistair MacLeod wrote about the changes to the Basel III rules and how they will greatly affect the physical and paper gold markets if implemented in their current form.


MacLeod’s article from last week is an excellent primer on the definitions and inner workings of the rules, the gold market and the changes to the rules.  The short redux is that the advantage to using unallocated accounts, savings accounts which are linked to gold by holding futures contracts, will end.


We’ve discussed parts of this in the past.  The process of creating fake supply to control the price of gold is on the line with these rule changes.

A prominent crypto analytics firm has issued a new report suggesting the Islamic Republic was able to successfully weather the Trump-era sanctions storm of the past few years by generating up to a billion dollars a year through mining cryptocurrencies. 


Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic concluded that a whopping 4.5% of all global bitcoin mining takes place in Iran alone. The Iranian government itself has acknowledged these attempts to beat the near total economic embargo on the country, which has been in effect and progressively ramped up since Trump pulled out of the Obama-era JCPOA nuclear deal in May 2018.

Submitted by Bruce Wilds of Advancing Time,


The cost of living numbers prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are highly misleading. Currently, the government understates inflation by using a formula based on the concept of a “constant level of satisfaction” that evolved during the first half of the 20th century in academia. This extended into the BLS re-weightings sales outlets such as discount or mass merchandisers with Main Street shops. Those promoting this change claimed it was simply another way to measure inflation and it still reflected the true cost of living.  







The fact is, politicians and those behind this system created it as a way to reduce the cost of living adjustments for governme…</span>

It appears that Iran may be applying some last-minute leverage just ahead of the final round of nuclear talks in Vienna, and at a moment it&#x27;s being widely reported that the main parties, including the US, are on the cusp of agreeing on a deal as final documents are being drafted. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Sunday announced that IAEA inspectors will no longer have access to surveillance images of the country&#x27;s nuclear sites. 


&quot;From May 22 and with the end of the three-month agreement, the agency will have no access to data collected by cameras inside the nuclear facilities agreed under the agreement,&quot; Qalibaf said as announced in state television.

Authored by Christopher Whalen via TheInstitutionalRiskAnalyst.com,


Back in 2019, we published a post in The Institutional Risk Analyst called “Nationalizing the Federal Funds Market,” that talked about the increasingly overt actions of the Federal Open Market Committee in the market for short-term funding.


Then as now, we view the actions of the FOMC as slowly destroying the private money markets in the US and preparing to very visibly push the big banks out of the transmission chain of monetary policy.

Last week, when cryptos again plunged on the well-timed recurring &quot;news&quot; report that China was again banning crypto - something China has been doing with zero success since 2014 but has taken on new urgency now that its Digital Yuan has emerged as a total flop - this time in the format of cracking down in Proof-of-Work (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0) crypto miners, we said that this could be the best thing to happen for crypto: after all, the China was and is the bitcoin bears biggest friend: as long as bitcoin is mostly mined in China, where coal power plants account for most of electrical generation, bitcoin will remain &quot;dirty&quot; and give the ESG fanatics ammo to criticize bitcoin.

Authored by Cara Ding via The Epoch Times,


Chicago’s largest police union on Wednesday issued a vote of no confidence against Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown.







The vote came during a Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) meeting where police officers vented their frustrations, new and old, with the mayor and and the police department, Chicago FOP president John Catanzara told The Epoch Times.


Emotions were running high, Catanzara said, and one member grabbed the microphone to suggest a vote of no confidence. All members present at the meeting, about 150 active and retired police officers, voted for it.

A bizarre and alarming incident which officials are calling unprecedented unfolded over the skies of Eastern Europe on Sunday. A Ryanair flight which had departed Athens and was en route to Vilnius - the capital of Lithuania - was forced to land in Belarus to allow state intelligence and security services to detain a journalist who&#x27;s long been critical of President Alexander Lukashenko.


Bloomberg has identified the detained journalist is Raman Pratasevich, described as &quot;the former editor-in-chief of the most popular Telegram news channel in Belarus&quot; who was &quot;arrested in the Minsk airport after the plane landed, according to the Minsk-based human rights center Viasna, which…</span>

It&#x27;s never just one thing. This week Elon Musk, China, and pipeline cyber attackers all contributed to another crash, but, as Decrypt&#x27;s Jeff John Roberts details below, there&#x27;s cause for optimism.


It began with Elon Musk bashing Bitcoin, and ended with a renewed crypto crackdown in China. Those came as book-ends to a spate of other bad news in cryptoland, including a stomach-churning market crash and anger over Bitcoin&#x27;s role in facilitating a massive cyber attack on an east coast oil pipeline. All of this saw Bitcoin limp into the weekend well below the $40,000 mark as the entire crypto industry licked its wounds.


And this weekend has seen the losses accelerate further with Bitcoin back below $34k..…</span>

Transitory or not transitory, that is the question.


The challenges from cracking supply-chains and the resulting strain on production and inventory are being felt widely. If you are looking to furnish a home, you have probably dealt with major delays in the delivery of your new sofa and may instead be sitting on beanbags. If you are looking to buy a car, you might be walking out with the sticker price and the wrong color. And good luck if you are trying to rent a car: if only Hertz had waited a year to file for bankruptcy it would be worth tens of billions today.

Market Review &amp; Update


After another rough start to the week, the bulls finally showed up and flipped our “money flow” indicators back to a buy signal. As we stated last week:



“Well, that follow-through failed to occur.Not only did the “buy signal” not trigger, but the market also broke down through the previous consolidation range. As I said, it did not work out as planned. The last exposure we took on is now pressuring the portfolio momentarily, but we should benefit from the turn if we are correct.”



With markets deeply oversold on a short-term basis and with signals at levels that generally precede short-term rallies, the rally on Thursday and Friday …</span>

Authored by Kit Knightly via Off-Guardian.org,


New policies will artificially deflate “breakthrough infections” in the vaccinated, while the old rules continue to inflate case numbers in the unvaccinated.







The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) is altering its practices of data logging and testing for “Covid19” in order to make it seem the experimental gene-therapy “vaccines” are effective at preventing the alleged disease.


They made no secret of this, announcing the policy changes on their website in late April/early May, (though naturally without admitting the fairly obvious motivation behind the change).

Three Markets topics to discuss today:


Issue #1: What are US markets trying to tell us? It would be tempting to say “Nothing” … That we’re only 3 percent off the S&amp;P 500’s record close of 4,233, set all of 8 trading days ago. That there’s plenty of good news to come. That Europe is just now reopening … All these are true, but they are also broadly known and therefore already in asset prices.

Some of the world&#x27;s rarest cacti are found in the deserts of South America. A recent raid in Italy uncovered a smuggling network of thorny succulents, according to NYTimes. 


The year&#x27;s long operation, dubbed &quot;Operation Atacama,&quot; was a collaborative effort that began in February 2020 by Italian and Chilean authorities to return some of the rarest cacti to Chile.

Authored by Brian McGlinchey via Stark Realities,


The Center for Disease Control’s major easing of its mask-use recommendations was a welcome development, giving Americans hope that logic can triumph over the CDC’s bureaucratic inertia and its Covid-era tendency to push the most severe restrictions on human activity at every turn.

With the possible exception of international trade, no topic in economics contains more myths than monetary theory. 







In the present article I address four popular opinions concerning money that suffer from either ambiguity or outright falsehood.


One: &quot;Money represents a claim on goods and services.&quot;

By Adam Andrjewski, founder of OpenTheBooks.com, via RealClearPolicy


As President Joe Biden considers forgiving $10,000 in student debt per borrower and ending tuition for many students at public colleges, it is worth noting that college graduates already have not paid $435 billion back to the federal government.


That’s right, of the government’s $1.4 trillion student loan portfolio, almost one-third is unpaid.

At the same time we take one step forward from government overreach and Covid panic, with the CDC finally ending its mask mandate, it feels like we&#x27;re taking two steps back, as the desperation to get literally every single person on Earth vaccinated still feels more and more palpable - even as the nation nears 50% of its population having at least one dose of the vaccine already.

Millions of people in the Middle East were shocked after witnessing a rare security incident during a live broadcast of the sermon at Mecca&#x27;s Great Mosque on Friday. Mecca is considered the holiest place in the Islamic world, and in recent years security has been greatly beefed up amid the continued influx of millions of pilgrims weekly, but also amid increasing threats and incidents.

It was Musk&#x27;s public critiquing of Bitcoin mining&#x27;s environmental impact that started a chain of events that led to Bitcoin crashing last week, before eventually steadying and paring some of its losses.

Even though the communists had won the Chinese Civil War and been in total power since 1945, Chairman Mao still believed that there was too much capitalist influence in China.

Another day, another attempt by China - where the reception of the digital yuan has been a total disaster so far much to Beijing&#x27;s complete humiliation - to crash Crypto, with Reuters and Bloomberg reporting moments ago that just two days after the PBOC barred financial institutions from accepting bitcoin as payment, China&#x27;s vice premier Liu He said (at 11pm on Friday local time) that China will crack down on bitcoin mining…</span>

We’ve been talking about the inflation threat for months. But the markets have been acting as if the real threat is the Federal Reserve trying to fight inflation by tightening monetary policy. With every bit of inflation news, gold has sold off. But after last week’s hotter than expected CPI data, it looks like investors may be starting to see the light and realizing that the central bank can’…</span>

Scams, frauds, flim flams, and grifts are nothing new to America. In fact, confidence games were old hat when Clifton Wooldridge published his 1906 classic, The Grafters of America: Who They Are and How They Work, which describes common cons in fin de siecle Chicago.

You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows. You also don’t need an economist to know what happens when the government pays people to stay home. Unemployment rose to 6.1% in April despite thousands of U.S. businesses desperate to hire — especially in the restaurant and hospitality industries.

But instead of trying to punish the liars who perpetrated that fraud, it is targeting the truth-tellers who challenged and exposed the conspiracy to negate the 2016 election.

WeWork CEO Sandeep Mathrani made headlines a few weeks ago when he declared during an interview that workers who prefer the WFH life to the office are typically &quot;lazier&quot; than their pro-commuting peers. His comment elicited backlash on social media, generating &quot;buzz&quot; that the company&#x27;s PR advisers probably pitched as an improvement over the spectacularly bad press that ultimately forced the company to a…</span>

Authored by Isabel van Brugen and Jan Jekielek via The Epoch Times,


The lockdowns implemented to curb the transmission of COVID-19 in the United States and across the globe have not only been a “heinous abuse of power,” but they have also failed to protect the elderly and vulnerable, according to former White House COVID-19 adviser Dr. Scott Atlas.

Oil prices dropped again early on Thursday after Iran’s president said that the world powers had accepted during the latest round of talks that sanctions against Iran would be lifted.


As of 10:39 a.m. EDT on Thursday, WTI Crude was trading down 0.95 percent at $62.76. Brent Crude prices had declined by 1.07 percent to trade below $66 a barrel—at $65.96

After yesterday&#x27;s bloodbathery, today was the big bounce back.

My intent is not to target Cathie Wood or the ARK team personally.

There&#x27;s no question that the SPAC frenzy has slowed substantially from its frenzied peak late last year, but even as the pace of dealmaking has slowed (giving weary junior investment-banking analysts a rest), there&#x27;s little question that the SPAC trend has changed the nature of dealmaking, especially for Private Equity firms, as Institutional Investor pointed out.

As expected, today&#x27;s overnight reverse repo facility usage soared above $300 billion, surging $57BN from $293BN on Wednesday to a whopping $351BN as 48 counterparties parked their reserves with the Fed in exchange for a 0.000% rate.







The surge in usage pushed the total to not only well above the Covid crisis high of $285BN, but was the fifth highest on record!

On Monday Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave a fiery speech to supporters which blasted Biden&#x27;s &quot;inaction&quot; over the Gaza crisis, addressing Joe Biden to specifically say the US president has &quot;blood on his hands&quot;. He was further reacting to the recent reports that Biden approved a $735 million dollar weapons sale from the United States to Israel, essentially accusing the US of supporting genocide against the Pal…</span>

Just under 20% of Seattle police have quit the force over the past year and a half, according to CBS News, citing the city&#x27;s interim Chief of Police.







The revelation comes after more than a year of violent clashes with anti-police protesters from BLM and Antifa, and a city council which has neutered the Seattle PD&#x27;s ability to use crowd control devices that social justice activists say didn&#x27;t go far enough.

“I can’t even think about how much money I just paid in interest,” 44 year old Jamie Johnson said, thinking back to a payday loan he took out in April 2020.


His $5,000 loan - which eventually accrued interest at a clip of up to 589% annualized - was the topic of a new Bloomberg article on payday and predatory lending.

The hits just keep coming. First, lumber prices exploded. Second, there was a terrible jobs report. Third, there was a gas shortage. These are all SAD stories–Supply And Demand. They are also, of course, stories about adaptation, adjustment, resilience, and unintended consequences.

Angry that Japan has yet to respond directly to the concerns of the international community, China again urged Japan on Monday to face up to its responsibility and refrain from &quot;wantonly&quot; disposing the radioactive, polluted Fukushima water before reaching consensus with all stakeholders and international agencies through consultations.

So ran the headline in the Jerusalem Post atop an analysis of the Gaza war, which began:



“The IDF is registering great achievements in Operation Guardian of the Walls, but meanwhile the house appears to be collapsing from within.”

Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo sees a major change coming in the world of U.S. banks. In fact, he predicts that they could wind up doing away with 200,000 jobs, or 10% of the industry&#x27;s total employee count, over the next decade.

Texas lawmakers have proposed Senate Bill 1728 (SB 1728) to slap Tesla owners with annual taxes between $240 and $400. Lawmakers claim EV owners need to &quot;pay their fair share&quot; and &quot;make up for&quot; fuel taxes they don&#x27;t pay at the pump that supports the state&#x27;s effort to modernize transportation infrastructure.

The problem with the North American lumber industry is that supply is controlled by just a few firms that can easily manipulate prices. For instance, WSJ reports lumber mills are in no rush to bring on additional capacity as they reap the rewards of consumers paying four times the average price.

Last week we noted that one of the clear trends to emerge as a result of the recent horrific price action in tech stocks, was the continued aggressive selling - and shorting - of tech stocks by hedge funds. The latest weekly report from Goldman&#x27;s Prime Brokerage confirms this.

This week&#x27;s solar activity report shows a geomagnetic storm watch is in effect between May 18-19. Two Earth-facing sunspots have been identified by NASA&#x27;s Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) satellite and could produce storms as early as Tuesday. 


NASA designated the sunspots as AR2822 and AR2823 and are Earth-facing.

New York Mayor Andrew Cuomo (D) will receive $5.1 million for his memoir detailing his &#x27;leadership&#x27; during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the New York Times.


In addition to earning $3.12 million last year, state officials announced on Monday that his contract for the book also included another $2 million to be paid over the next two years - dwarfing his governor&#x27;s salary of $225,000.

The White House Senior Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci stated Sunday that the coronavirus pandemic has revealed that the US is a fundamentally racist country.







Speaking to graduates of Emory University, Fauci declared that the virus has revealed the “undeniable effects of racism in our society.”

Summerlin, the suburb of west Las Vegas creeping ever closer to the mountains, looks to be crowded with fully paved streets, streetlights, block walls, and blue top lots. With lumber, labor, and other materials in short supply, home construction can’t keep up.

While everyone from the White House to the Fed has downplayed blistering inflation in just about everything as &#x27;transitory&#x27; as we emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, Democratic leaders are beginning to panic behind the scenes over its potential impact on the 2022 elections, where Democrats will have to defend slim majorities in both the House and Senate.

With Elon Musk&#x27;s &quot;stand&quot; against bitcoin last week, claiming that Tesla would not longer accept the coin for payments due to the environmental impact of mining it, the Tesla CEO quickly wound up doing an about-face in terms of his popularity with bitcoin fanatics.

One of the oldest celebrations of the LGBTQ community in the world has been New York City’s annual Pride celebration.

A year ago, when the global economy was in the depths of the Great Covid-19 Recession, we argued for a V-shaped recovery and the return of inflation. 12 months on, deep scepticism has given way to broad agreement.


The debate now is whether the strong recovery and pick-up in inflation were just a spurt driven by policy support and reop…</span>

That CIA tale, claiming Russia was paying Taliban fighters to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan, was cooked up by the CIA and then published by The New York Times on June 27 of last year, right as former Pres…</span>

An interesting thing happened in late March as news spread that Bill Hwang&#x27;s Archegos family office was liquidating after being hit with the biggest margin call since Lehman: George Soros, or rather his investment firm Soros Fund Management, was loading up on all the shares that Hwang was forced to liquidating.


According to the latest 13F filed by the family office shows that Soros bought some $375 Million of the most promin…</span>

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


The Fed has created trillions out of thin air to boost the speculative wealth of Wall Street, but it can&#x27;t print experienced workers willing to work for low wages.


The Federal Reserve is reassuring us daily that inflation is temporary, but allow me to assure you that wage inflation is just getting started and will accelerate rapidly. As I noted yesterday, the Fed can create currency out of thin and…</span>

The auto industry is already stuck between a rock and a hard place, as dealers struggle to get production up to speed despite an ongoing semiconductor chip shortage that has hamstrung production for some of the world&#x27;s biggest manufacturers.

Birmingham City Council is set to remove “extremely problematic” street names and statues to satiate BLM supporters after a dubious poll found that a majority of residents supported the decision.

It seems DoubleLine&#x27;s Jeffrey Gundlach has had a change of heart regarding bitcoin. And while the cryptocurrency&#x27;s spectacular rise has mostly converted skeptics into believers (or reluctant investors inspired by FOMO), for Gundlach, it&#x27;s the other way around.

In the modern digital world, social media reach is power.


The people with the most followers on Twitter, for example, have a massive platform to spread their messages, while those with large, engaged followings on Instagram are an advertiser’s dream sponsor partner.

Proof of stake is a consensus mechanism, which makes sure that only legitimate transactions get added to blocks.

	

	

	
It works by having validators lock up their cryptocurrency to secure the network.

As Americans warily eye new data showing both consumer and producer price inflation heating up beyond expectations, few of them realize the Federal Reserve has an explicit goal to relentlessly degrade the purchasing power of their savings.

In any given year during the past decade in the United States, more than 2.5 million Americans have died - from all causes.


The number has grown in recent years, climbing from 2.59 million in 2013 to 2.85 million in 2019. This has been due partially to the US’s aging population, and also due to rising obesity levels and drug overdoses. In fact, since 2010, growth ra…</span>

Just over a month ago, in our preview of earnings season, we said that &quot;Q1 earnings will be stellar, but are fully priced in and only guidance will matter&quot;, and sure enough the broader market is now below where it was a month ago despite the strongest earnings season in modern history: with 90% of S&amp;P500 companies having reported, the results show EPS rose by 46% year/year...

Authored by MN Gordon via EconomicPrism.com,


“The way to Hell is paved with good intentions,” remarked Karl Marx in Das Kapital.


The devious fellow was bemoaning evil capitalists for having the gall to use their own money for the express purpose of making more money.







Marx, a rambling busybody, was habitually wrong.  The road to hell is paved with something much more than good intentions.  Grift, graft, larceny, corruption a…</span>

Readers have all experienced the moment when an advertisement has creepily shown up on their social media feed after talking about it. And while companies swear they&#x27;re not using smartphone apps to tap into your conversations for advertising purposes, there&#x27;s a concept app that throws fuel on this fire.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said that about 40 percent of his agency’s employees have not received the COVID-19 vaccine, while a deputy at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said the agency is reporting similar numbers.

The Bank of Canada appears to be on to the scent of its own bullsh*t. 


The central bank of Canada admitted on Thursday of last week that &quot;some of the monetary policy tools it is using to address the COVID-19 pandemic, such as quantitative easing (QE), could widen wealth inequality,&quot; according to a new report from the Financial Post.

This week saw some doozy inflation readings beginning on Wednesday with the CPI reading and then again on Thursday with the PPI. CPI came in at 4.2% year-over-year, but a whopping 0.8% month-over-month. For context, 0.8% MoM implies 10% annualized inflation! The PPI was also hot, coming in at 6.2% YoY and 0.6% MoM.

We&#x27;ve all experienced the intrusive moment when an advertisement has creepily shown up on our social media feed after talking about it. This is super annoying in a world where corporate America spies on users via smartphone sensors.

Despite widespread vaccination availability and even the U.S. CDC saying that vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks, Toronto has decided to cancel an entire summer&#x27;s worth of social functions.

On taking the oath of office, Jan. 20, Joe Biden may not have realized it, but history had dealt him a pair of aces.


The COVID-19 pandemic had reached its apex, infecting a quarter of a million Americans every day. Yet, due to the discovery and distribution of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the incidence of infections had crested and was about to turn sharply down.

A Texas cafe owner is taking the Biden administration to court over alleged discrimination that prevents him from receiving COVID-19 relief grants because of his race and gender.

In the wake of Friday&#x27;s underwhelming jobs number, the media has been hungry for stories about people quitting prestigious jobs - like the Goldman MD who reportedly quit after making a fortune off dogecoin. 


The latest example comes courtesy of Bloomberg, which reported last night that the man who succeeded legendary &#x27;Bond King&#x27; Bill Gross as the head of global bonds at Janus Henderson (which over…</span>

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday said it is responsible for colleges to teach the idea that racism is embedded in the American system, dismissing criticism that such teaching aims at indoctrinating American youth.

President Biden spoke at the White House earlier this week to address an unsettling national trend – millions of jobs going unfilled in an economy still struggling to right itself. The president couldn’t deny the existence of the paradox: His own administration’s numbers show that millions of Americans are drawing unemployment while millions of jobs are going unfilled.

Real Vision managing editor Ed Harrison welcomes Raoul Pal, co-founder and CEO of Real Vision, to review the first week of the campaign, “Welcome to the Exponential Age.” Ed and Raoul explore how the past week’s interviews have either reinforced or dispelled Raoul’s macro thinking as well as what surprised him most.

When even Goldman - which has a history of aligning with the White House and the prevailing political administration du jour - refutes the falsehoods spread by the Biden administration about the origins of the unprecedented labor shortage, it&#x27;s time to change the narrative.

By Greg Miller of Freight Waves,


The headlines last August and September blared: “Trans-Pacific rates are going crazy.” “Rates are on fire.” “Records shattered.” Oh, what cargo shippers would give to get the rates they paid eight or nine months ago. Those earlier records were repeatedly shattered. It just happened yet again.

With tech stocks tumbling in recent weeks amid surging inflation fears, at least the commodity sector appears safe from the global reflationary risk-off wave that swept across markets. Besides the ups and downs daily, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite has been on a tear for the last five years. But since commodities began to outperform earlier this year, Nasdaq year-to-date gains are flat.

There have been few politicians in modern times who have done more to undermine personal liberty, capitalist prosperity, small government and especially world peace than the Cheney Clan. So upon Liz Cheney’s ouster from the #3 job in the US House GOP hierarchy, we say: Good riddance!

American shoppers continued to flock to the nation’s malls in greater numbers in April, with the foot traffic gap nearly halving in just two months, reinforcing the view of a retail recovery gaining traction.

To be sure, Bills had printed at 0.000% at auction previously, but that was largely during the reserve glut days of 2015.







So why now? The same reason usage of the Fed&#x27;s Reverse Repo facility has soared in recent weeks from zero to over $100 billion at the end of April, hitting a w…</span>

It’s Friday 3:00 am now in Gaza and Israel.

By Laura Cooper, Bloomberg reporter and Markets Live commentator


Inflation expectations matter when it comes to central-bank policy, with scope for markets to ramp up hedging bets as price uncertainty extends - and more potential shock-and-awe CPI prints add conviction to the debate.


While investor fears of runaway price pressures may yet prove overblown, as evidence of inflationary impulses builds, demand for hedges against the wid…</span>

A big lingering unknown is whether Israel&#x27;s powerful archenemy Hezbollah will open up a northern front to bog down Israel&#x27;s military as it continues striking Gaza, and as preparations are underway for a potential Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) ground invasion into the Hamas-controlled strip.

After several impressive quarters of huge gains for its recently launched Disney+ subscription service, Disney couldn&#x27;t quite make it this time and moments ago the company reported Q1 earnings that beat on the bottom line but missed on revenues and subscribers, sending the stock sliding in after hours.


Here are the details: first the good news:

It was an erratic day, which in so many ways was a mirror image of yesterday, and even though today&#x27;s blistering PPI print confirmed yesterday&#x27;s near-record CPI number, traders who expected a continuation of yesterday&#x27;s action were left nursing big losses.


Perhaps it was the fervent defense of the &quot;transitory inflation&quot; narrative on Wall Street, but whatever the reason, yesterday&#x27;s surge in the VIX reversed…</span>

Bank of America&#x27;s economists have been on a roll in the past three months.


Back in February, the bank looked at its credit and debit card spending data and concluded that consensus was far, far too low, predicting that the stimmy-fueled January retail sales print would be above 4.1%.







Not only was BofA&#x27;s outlier forecast right, but the headline retail sales number came in even higher: at a whopping 5.3%, nearly 5x higher than the consensus …</span>

Via InternationalMan.com,


Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) centers around the notion that the economy in general, and money in particular, should be the creatures of the State.

There are three interrelated political factions that wield actual power to change blind U.S. support for Israel: the U.S. Congress, the Democratic Party, and the Biden Administration. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who claims to oppose this U.S. posture toward Israel, has significant influence in and responsibility for each: she i…</span>

More than 120 retired generals, admirals, and military officers signed a letter that warned that the United States is embroiled in an existential fight and called on “all citizens” to get involved in local and state politics.

Donald Trump just can&#x27;t help himself.

A tiger that was seen roaming loose in a Houston area neighborhood over the weekend has yet to be located - but its owner has been identified and arrested.


The exotic animal reportedly belongs to a man named Victor Cuevas, who was out of jail on bond on an &quot;unrelated murder charge&quot;, according to local ABC affiliates. &quot;Cuevas is accused of shooting and killing a man in July 2017 and is out on a $125,0…</span>

Authored by Andrew Chen via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),


Economics professor Doug Allen wanted to know why so many early models used to create COVID-19 lockdown policies turned out to be highly incorrect. What he found was that a great majority were based on false assumptions and “tended to over-estimate the benefits and under-estimate the costs.” He found it troubling that policies such as total lockdowns wer…</span>

The NRA was dealt a serious blow on Tuesday after a Texas judge tossed the gun rights organization&#x27;s bid to declare bankruptcy, saying it was filed in &quot;bad faith&quot; in an effort to dodge litigation in New York.


Judge Harlin Hale tossed the case after New York Attorney General Letitia James and others questioned how legitimate the January 15th bankruptcy filing was, according to a report by Law 360.

The three largest economies by GDP are the US, China, and Japan. These are also the largest country stock markets by aggregate market cap. By our count, US-headquartered stocks add up to $44T in equity value, Chinese (and Hong Kong) stocks add up to $17.3T, and Japanese stocks add up to $6.5T. Meanwhile, Vanguard’s Total World Stock ETF allocates 57% to US stocks, 5% to Chinese stocks, and 7% to Japan…</span>

Authored by Isabel van Brugen via The Epoch Times,


Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) has signed into law legislation that designates gun stores as essential businesses allowed to remain open during an emergency—a move that will further protect gun stores, manufacturers, and trade associations from lawsuits.

The phenomenon of &quot;cancel culture&quot; is a toxic one metastasizing into a woke revolution war empowered by Big Tech and Big Business. Those unfamiliar with being canceled involve publicly shaming others and boycotting celebrities and companies. However, the art of canceling has progressed well beyond canceling public figures and is now used to garget average folks. The result can be devastating for ordinary people who may f…</span>

Being contrarian is hard work. You need to withstand ridicule, the loss of friends, employment, and acquaintances, face the imminent possibility that most of the time you’ll be wrong, and abandon the warm fuzzy feeling of having your otherwise friendly peers confirming your bias.

Amid all the chaos in equity markets, oil managed to bounce back to modest gains on the day with WTI as a weaker dollar offset some concerns of a growing pile up of crude in the U.S. Gulf Coast as refineries there cut runs in response to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown.



Traders are expecting “a gradual resolution to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown,” according to Louise Dickson, an analyst at consultant Rystad Energy.

After yesterday&#x27;s ugliness in big-tech and small-caps, many hoped for a bounce today.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he has officially scheduled a vote for Wednesday to oust House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) from her post, soon after he endorsed Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) for the No. 3 leadership spot.

The sexual harassment investigation against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) has widened in scope, as the state AG&#x27;s office has begun looking into whether a top Cuomo adviser linked access to COVID-19 vaccines with political support for the governor, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.

A rare direct &#x27;live fire&#x27; encounter took place Monday in the Strait of Hormuz between Iranian fast-attack boats and US naval warships. The Iranian vessels came dangerously close to multiple US ships during the incident in the vital waterway off Iran&#x27;s coast.
