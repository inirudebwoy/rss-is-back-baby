                    <span>&quot;The Idea That Inflation Is Transitory Is Nonsense&quot;: How One Hedge Fund Manager Plans To Profit From Fed Stupidity

            
Ahead of tomorrow&#x27;s FOMC decision, and in general, two clear camps are emerging when it comes to the increasingly acrimonious debate whether the current soaring inflation is &quot;transitory&quot; or not. In one camp we have the establishmentarians: those with little vision, limited imagination, and whose job precludes them from conceiving of any outcome but that accepted by the groupthink led by the Fed. As noted earlier, this now includes the vast majority of Wall Street...

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


The media has given highly favorable coverage to a new book by Dr. Carol Anderson, chair of Emory University’s Black Studies Department, that argues that “[the Second Amendment] was designed and has consistently been constructed to keep African Americans powerless and vulnerable.” 


In interviews with media outlets like CNN and NPR Anderson’s theory is not challenged on the history and purpose of the Second Amendment.


Like the contested claims of the “1619” project (which posited that slavery was the motivation for the establishment of the colonies), there might be a reluctance by academics to raise the countervailing historical sources out of fear of being…</span>

Just days after we noted that people in South Korea saw bitcoin as their &quot;only chance of escape&quot; from their social status, it looks as though non-fungible tokens are also catching on in Southeast Asia. 


At least that was the topic of a new report by Nikkei, which took at look at how skeptics and believers are clashing head-to-head about NFTs, whether they have any value and whether or not they could be the future of asset ownership and finance. 


&quot;NFTs are indeed changing the lives of some Southeast Asians&quot; the report notes, with some people using them to earn extra income. One such person is Gilbert Jalova, who has been buying and selling digital assets in a game called Axie Infinity. He can earn…</span>

Mike Fratantuono grew up in a restaurant. Literally.


For decades, Sunset Restaurant in Glen Burnie, Maryland, was the family business. Over the years, he’d done seemingly every job imaginable: busboy, bartender, and butcher; prep cook and plumber; handyman and manager.


Fratantuono says that’s what made it so hard to watch the family’s legacy become a COVID casualty in 2020.

                    <span>Ceasefire Over? Israeli Jets Attack After Incendiary Balloons Fired From Gaza

            
The Israeli military said its aircraft attacked Hamas armed compounds in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday in response to 20 fires sparked by incendiary balloons launched earlier in the day from the territory into southern Israel.





At least one explosive balloon was reported over southern Israel, with residents reporting that they saw and heard the balloon explode in the air, according to Israeli media.


In a statement, the military said that it was &quot;ready for all scenarios, including renewed fighting in the face of continued terrorist acts emanating from Gaza&quot;.

— وكالة شهاب للأنباء (@ShehabAgency) June 15, 2021


Israel&#x27;s new prime minister, Naftali Bennett, had said in the past that the Israeli government should not tolerate incendiary balloons, and must retaliate as if Hamas had fired rockets into Israel.







The escalation came after an Israeli nationalist march, as part of &quot;Jerusalem Day&quot; in East Jerusalem that angered Palestinians.







 


Crowds waving blue and white Israeli flags set off from Damascus Gate, the main entry to the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City, dancing and chanting &quot;This is our home&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem is ours.&quot;







Iron Dome anti-missile defense units were also reinforced ahead of the march, amid threats by Hamas in recent days and weeks.


On Tuesday evening, Defense Minister Benny Gantz held a situation assessment with IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi, Shin Bet head Nadav Argaman, IDF Intelligence Directorate head Maj.-Gen. Tamir Heiman, IDF intelligence analysis chief Brig.-Gen. Amit Saar and Defense Ministry Policy and Political-Military Bureau head Zohar Palti.


Is the Egyptian-brokered cease-fire officially over?

Hundreds of people were administered doses of expired COVID-19 vaccines during an event in New York City’s Times Square, city health officials authorities said.


The New York City Health Department confirmed that 899 individuals got Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine at the former NFL Experience building between June 5 and June 10.







A spokesperson for the department told news outlets on Tuesday that those people should schedule another vaccination session as soon as possible.

...time to ignore Dr.Copper once again!?


Copper prices plunged on Tuesday to their lowest levels in seven weeks over concerns about Federal Reserve&#x27;s monetary tightening and a pull-back in Chinese demand. 


From aluminum to copper to lead to nickel to tin to zinc, the entire base metal complex is down anywhere from 2-4%.







Focusing on copper, future prices on the London Metal Exchange are down 4% to their lowest levels in seven weeks. Three-month LME copper futures were trading around $6,563 per ton, down 11% in 25 trading sessions since topping at $10,747 in early May.

It was 24 years ago this summer that Steve Jobs was coaxed back to Apple. The only thing was that investors weren’t interested. Titans of tech at the time like Michael Dell dismissed Apple’s long-term potential, and said the company’s assets should quite simply be sold off ahead of it folding altogether.


Apple nearly died, but for a $150 million investment care of Bill Gates.


Funnily enough Netflix opened its doors right around the time that Jobs returned to Apple. The reaction from investors was somewhat similar. The DVD-by-Mail company’s prospects were once so questionable that it tried twice to sell itself to Blockbuste…</span>

One of California&#x27;s biggest blunders has been the passage of Proposition 47, which lowered penalties for thefts under $950 and sparked dramatic increases in shoplifting across the metro area over the last several years. Otherwise known as Prop. 47, it&#x27;s supported by social justice warriors and criminal justice reformers, and the liberal establishment, who have also managed to defund the local police. 


The effects of allowing chaos to prevail in liberal-run San Fransico have resulted in 17 Walgreens Pharmacy locations shuttering their doors in the past five years, and at least ten since 2019.

                    <span>Pennsylvania Public Schools Received More COVID Aid Than Healthcare Providers

            
Authored by Adam Andrzejewski via RealClearPolicy.com,


While the country fought a deadly pandemic for more than a year and schools remained closed, the education system in Pennsylvania received more federal aid than health care systems did.


The Keystone State collected more than $34 billion in federal aid, including through the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan Act, according to the think tank Commonwealth Foundation.







But the bulk of that money did not go to the Department of Health, Medicaid programs, assisted living and nursing homes, vaccine distribution, hospitals, and other healthcare providers.


Public education received 29% ($10.1 billion) of the aid, while 24% ($8.2 billion) went to healthcare.


The Pennsylvania-based think tank found that while nursing homes received $944 million in grants from the Covid-19 aid bills, the Philadelphia School District alone got $1.8 billion.


Students were learning remotely - from home - or in a hybrid of school/home learning for most, if not all, the school year. Why did schools get $10.1 billion in federal aid on top of their annual state and federal aid?


The health system in Pennsylvania and the rest of the country struggled, and in some cases, failed, to provide adequate care during the pandemic. They should get the bulk of the Covid-19 funding, not special interests, which shuttered schools and stunted students’ growth.

President Biden on Wednesday said he&#x27;s feeling &quot;very good&quot; following the bilateral meeting with Turkey&#x27;s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but both sides have remained tight lipped about what was actually discussed in the Monday meeting on the sidelines of the one-day NATO summit.


US-Turkey relations were already at a low point going into the meeting, particularly after the Biden administration&#x27;s formal recognition of the Armenian Genocide. But when asked by a reporter about the meeting, Biden declined to divulge any details:



President Joe Biden on Tuesday declined to offer details about his one-on-one meeting with Turkish President Recep Erdogan, saying he&#x27;d let the Turks talk about it.

Ignoring long-term problems can work for a while, but eventually they catch up with you...







Over the years, I have written many articles about alarming long-term trends in our society that desperately needed to be addressed.  Of course the vast majority of those long-term trends never got much attention, because our political system tends to reward politicians that focus on short-term issues.  As a result, many of the long-term trends that I have written about previously have now gotten to a point where they have started to become very serious short-term problems.  In this article, I would like to sh…</span>

Oil prices extended their recent (meteoric) rise with WTI topping $72 - 32 month highs - as investors weighed the outlook for rising demand (hopes on gasoline and aviation fuel use rise from pandemic lows and global stockpiles are drawn down) against extended anti-virus curbs in some economies (with officials tackling the challenge posed by more infectious variants).



&quot;The continuing good news on the demand front and upbeat sentiment on the financial markets as the key reasons for the latest upswing,&quot; Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg said in a note.


&quot; ... In our opinion, however, the crucial (fundamental) test for the oil market and its subsequent price performance is yet to come - will demand continue to rec…</span>

                    <span>&quot;We Can Now Return To Life As We Know&quot; - More States Move To Reopen As US COVID Deaths Top 600K

            
As worries about the spread of deadly COVID variants prompts the UK to delay plans to reopen its economy, in the US, it&#x27;s full steam ahead as more major states announced reopening measures on Tuesday, while the number of confirmed COVID deaths in the country topped 600K.


Daily US cases and deaths have fallen substantially as the percentage of the adult population that has been vaccinated has climbed. Now, with some states hitting their thresholds for herd immunity, they&#x27;re loosening the yoke of repressive restrictions that were justified for more than a year because of COVID.

Having broken its 4-month streak of buying in March (the longest streak since 2017), China sold US Treasuries for the second straight month in April (the latest TIC data available), down to fall to $1.096trn in April from $1.100trn in March...

But, perhaps the most notable aspect of today&#x27;s TIC data was that for the first time since April 2020, Foreigners sold US equities in April... (and that was the biggest net selling since August 2019 when we had the repo crisis and NOT QE)...







Additionally, the last twelve months&#x27; transactions in TSYs by foreign central banks just turned positive for the first time since Feb 2015...







Overall in April:




	
Foreign net buying of Treasuries at $49.6b

	

	

	
Foreign net selling of equities at $13.3b

	

	

	
Foreign net buying of corporate debt at $10.1b

	

	

	
Foreign net buying of agency debt at $46.8b

	







And finally, despite the 12mth net buying, the recent trend of rotation into Treasury reserves from gold may have just reverted...

Following the latest hot inflationary print, more investors are becoming skeptical of the Fed&#x27;s view that inflationary pressures are &quot;transitory&quot;. Yesterday, famed investor Paul Tudor Jones lamented the deluge of money pumped into the financial system by fiscal and monetary policymakers, and warned that markets might go &quot;bat sh*t crazy&quot; after Wednesday&#x27;s FOMC press conference, which PTJ believes could be the most important meeting of Chair Jerome Powell&#x27;s tenure, as the Fed sees its grip on a rapidly overheating economy start to slip.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


The New York Times faced a stinging contradiction from Politico this week after it ran a story besmirching the lead prosecutor in the leak investigation launched under former Attorney General Bill Barr.


The article relies on anonymous sources to claim that Assistant U.S. Attorney Osmar Benevenuto of the District of New Jersey was brought in by Barr as part of his “small circle of trusted aides officials.” 


In reality, it appears that Benevenuto was not initially selected by Barr and does not appear to have known him.







Here is what the New York Times wrote:

                    <span>An Apparently Confused Biden Goes Silent After Fielding Question About Putin

            
More clips have surfaced which highlight Biden&#x27;s apparent difficulty in handling unscripted back-and-forth discussion during his ongoing foreign policy focused Europe trip. As early as the weekend at the G-7 the Associated Press had noticed a &quot;handful of verbal stumbles&quot; the US president made. As we also highlighted there would be more to come. And then at his big Monday night NATO summit presser, there was the following bizarre moment...



Vladimir Putin laughed at the suggestion that you had called him a &#x27;killer,&#x27;&quot; a CNN reporter asked. &quot;Is that still your belief, sir, that he is a killer?&quot;

Comedian Jon Stewart overpowered Stephen Colbert&#x27;s ability to shill on Monday, hijacking the Late Show&#x27;s return to a live (and fully vaccinated) audience with an epic rant on the COVID-19 lab-leak theory.







&quot;I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to science. Science has, in many ways, helped ease the suffering of this pandemic, which was more than likely caused by science,&quot; Stewart said after Colbert asked how he was feeling about the scientific response to COVID-19.


&quot;Do you mean perhaps there’s a chance that this was created in a lab?&quot; asked Colbert, adding &quot;There&#x27;s an investigation.&quot;


&quot;A chance?&quot; shot back Stewart - kicking the door open.

The Biden administration is taking steps to establish a US uranium reserve, a proposal put forward by the Trump administration which could boost mining of the mineral as well as the potential to expand nuclear energy in the United States.

Pink Floyd song writer Roger Waters slammed Mark Zuckerberg during a press conference recently, announcing that the Facebook owner had offered a “huge, huge amount of money” to use the iconic song Another Brick In The Wall Part II in an advert for Instagram.







Speaking at an event to raise awareness about imprisoned WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, Waters noted the deep deep irony of Facebook wanting to buy and use a song that rails against ‘thought control’ and mindless conformity.


Waters described the development as part of Zuckerberg’s “insidious movement… to take over absolutely everything.”

Authored by Michael Maharrey via SchiffGold.com,


The Federal Reserve is the engine that drives one of the biggest, most powerful governments in the history of the world.


Without the Fed, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the government to fund its foreign wars, its massive, unsustainable social programs, the ever-growing police state, and the tangled web of corporate welfare programs. It’s almost certain none of this would exist as we know it today – not even close. The federal government would truly be limited.


Although the Federal Reserve is relatively new within the scope of American history, its roots go back to the early days of the republic and the First Bank of the United States, chartered by Congres…</span>

But at least some Goldman employees who miss working from the beach, the bank might soon be moving some of its front-office workers from NYC down to sunny Florida, becoming the latest major Wall Street firm to beef up its operations in the Sunshine State.







Goldman will join Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb&#x27;s Third Point, the private equity giant Apollo and a host of other firms in moving more employees to Florida, a state that, among other perks, has no income tax, according to a report published Monday by Insider.  But talk of the bank moving some of its personnel has been circulating since…</span>

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Viterbo University in Wisconsin has been the scene of protests for months over alleged hate crimes committed on campus.  The police however has charged a student, Victoria Unanka, with what it says was a hoax hate crime involving the setting of a fire in her dormitory. What interested me about the case was the curious combination of criminal charges. She is being charged with both arson and “the negligent handling of burning materials.”







The arson occurred during protests over alleged racial incidents on campus. A student complained about racial slurs directed against her. The university cancelled classes and campus-wide demonstrations were held.

Coming off Monday&#x27;s meeting of top NATO leaders in Brussels with Joe Biden, President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued a shock statement, claiming that NATO has &quot;agreed&quot; to admit Ukraine into the military alliance with Biden&#x27;s blessing.


However, in simultaneous remarks given during Biden&#x27;s anticipated press conference, the president actually appeared to suggest nothing has really change. He said Ukraine has more it must do to meet the &quot;criteria&quot; for NATO membership. &quot;It depends on whether they meet the criteria,&quot; Biden told reporters. &quot;The fact is, they still have to clean up corruption... School’s out on that question.&quot;

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have published a study that reveals most of the perpetrators of mass shootings in America are people with undiagnosed psychiatric disorders.







The study focused on 115 assailants of shootings committed between 1982 and 2019, and then narrowed that number down to ones who survived.



“We found that most mass shooters in our study experienced undiagnosed and unmedicated psychiatric illness,” the researchers noted.



Describing the findings as “striking,” the study notes that symptoms of clinical psychiatric disorders were identified in almost all the shooters, 32 out of 35.

On the fifth anniversary of the PULSE nightclub massacre in Orlando, numerous senators, politicians and activist groups commemorated that tragic event by propagating an absolute falsehood: namely, that the shooter, Omar Mateen, was motivated by anti-LGBT animus. The evidence is definitive and conclusive that this is false — Mateen, like so many others …</span>

                    <span>Here Comes Another Retail Sales Miss

            
Bank of America&#x27;s economists have been on a roll in the past four months.


Back in February, the bank looked at its credit and debit card spending data and concluded that consensus was far, far too low, predicting that the stimmy-fueled January retail sales print would be above 4.1%.







Not only was BofA&#x27;s outlier forecast right, but the headline retail sales number came in even higher: at a whopping 5.3%, nearly 5x higher than the consensus estimate of a 1.1% rise.


One month later, when the Wall Street herd scrambled to make up for its clueless January forecast by being overly optimistic, Bank of America again took the contrarian approach, not because it wanted to but because that&#x27;s what the data showed: spending on BofA …</span>

On Monday NBC released its full sit-down interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which was initially previewed Friday, just days before Wednesday&#x27;s much anticipated bilateral summit with President Joe Biden. It was the first interview Putin has given to a US network in nearly three years.


During the full interview Putin dismissed the latest major accusations of mounting cyberattacks on US infrastructure as &quot;farcical&quot;. &quot;Where is the proof? It&#x27;s becoming farcical,&quot; Putin questioned, adding, &quot;We have been accused of all kinds of things, election interference, cyberattacks and so on and so forth, and not once, not one time, did they bother to produce any kind of evidence …</span>

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


There has been a great deal of controversy over the graduation address of Fairfax County school board member Abrar Omeish to the Justice High School in Falls Church on June 7th.


In her remarks to the graduates, Omeish praised a teacher who made social activism part of her class and warned the graduates that they are going into a world filled with racism and white supremacy.


However, what really struck an admittedly libertarian chord with me was the third danger that she warned about: “excessive individualism.”  







Like free speech, individualism is now being presented as a danger rather than a strength in our society.


Omeish is a strong speaker w…</span>

A handful of what appears more than the usual Biden gaffes while on his Europe trip has some pundits raising yet more concerns about the 78-year old president&#x27;s cognitive decline in old age. Last year on the campaign trail a series of bizarre and questionable moments of &quot;concern&quot; - all caught on film - were dismissed in mainstream media as pro-Trump conspiracies.

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


Nobody seems to notice the &#x27;diminishing returns&#x27; on Fed manipulation, oops, I mean &#x27;intervention&#x27;.







Perhaps it shouldn&#x27;t surprise us that everything that will eventually matter is ignored until it does matter--but by then it&#x27;s too late. Here&#x27;s a short list to start the discussion:


1. The Federal Reserve has transformed the American populace into a nation of dismayingly over-confident gamblers. I&#x27;ve been writing about moral hazard--the separation of risk from consequence--since 2011. Punters who are insulated from risk will have an insatiable appetite for risky bets, which is precisely what we see on a mass scale, as the confidence that t…</span>

Update (1520ET): As the dangerous chemical fire at Berkshire-owned Chemtool plant in Rockton continued to burn Monday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker activated the State Emergency Operation Center to mobilize emergency response to monitor and suppress a large chemical fire in Winnebago County.







The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and Illinois Emergency Management Agency have already dispatched crews to the area to assist local authorities. The Illinois State Emergency Operations Center in Springfield has also been activated, and members of the Illinois National Guard and mobile response vehicles have been dispatched to the area.

Double Or Nothing


There’s lots to cover today, but let’s start with inflation. Friday’s Michigan consumer sentiment survey saw the headline rise to 86.4 from 82.9 because expectations jumped from 78.8 to 83.8, while current conditions fell; and 1-year ahead inflation expectations dropped from 4.6% back to 4.0%, and five-year inflation from 3.0% to 2.8%, even as the ‘good time to buy a house or car’ sub-indices collapsed due to the inflation being seen in those areas. Perhaps everyone surveyed closely tracks the lumber market, where prices are tumbling; or they instinctively grasp high prices destroy demand; in which case, everything is “transitory”. Like anaesthetic-free dentistry?

Last week, when discussing the bizarre summer doldrums in the market which pushed the VIX to the lowest level since the onset of the covid pandemic, we said that this period of abnormal market quiet is likely to last until this Friday&#x27; quad-witch, when a massive amount of gamma and delta expire and are de-risked, in the process eliminating one of the natural downside stock buffers (see &quot;4 Reasons Why The Market Doldrums End With Next Friday&#x27;s Op-Ex&quot;).


So picking up on the topic of Friday&#x27; potentially market-moving opex, Goldman&#x27; in-house derivatives expert, Rocky Fishman, previews June’s upcoming expiration which he dubs as &quot;large - comparable to a typical quarterly.&quot; Specifically, there …</span>

China has reacted fiercely to the final G7 communique issued on Sunday by underscoring that such a &quot;small&quot; group of countries in reality can never decide the fate of the globe. &quot;The days when global decisions were dictated by a small group of countries are long gone,&quot; an official statement from the Chinese embassy in London said.


The embassy further protested the G7 communique over its highlighting China malfeasance from its mention of Taiwan to Hong Kong to Xinjiang, slamming the group of wealthy democracies as interfering in China&#x27;s sovereign affairs.

Summary: With your meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Geneva just days away, mainstream media are barely reporting – and at times distorting – olive-branch remarks by Putin, and are at pains to &quot;accentuate the negative&quot;. We are particularly concerned over the incessant media commentary on &quot;Russian hacking&quot;, which seems to be aimed at mousetrapping you into an ill-advised confrontation with Putin. Revelations since the last summit in July 2018 – including testimony under oath to Congress – give President Putin some very high cards. Should things get acrimo…</span>

By Greg Miller of FreightWaves,


The extreme consolidation within the container liner sector is the kind of thing owners of tankers and bulk carriers can only dream of. The latest data from Alphaliner highlights the extent of liner consolidation, how soon the rankings will change, and how newbuilding orders will render the carrier arena even more concentrated than it already is.







The top 10 carriers now operate 85% of global shipping capacity. Four groups — Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM and COSCO — control more than half of capacity (58%). The top seven, including Hapag-Lloyd, ONE and Evergreen, control 78%.

The most significant challenge in fighting the virus pandemic has been the political polarization on public health measures. A new CBS News-YouGov poll released Sunday shows Democrats and Republicans remain deeply divided on an employee&#x27;s right to either chose or waive the right to be administered a vaccine.

Update (1310ET): British President Boris Johnson has expanded the UK&#x27;s controversial COVID-19 lockdown by another four weeks Monday, citing concerns about the &quot;Delta&quot; COVID mutant that first emerged from India. The PM said the delay would allow British adults more time to get vaccinated.


 


&quot;It&#x27;s sensible to wait just a little longer,&quot; the PM said as he claimed that the government is concerned that the link between COVID and hospitalizations &quot;hasn&#x27;t been severed.&quot;


The UK&#x27;s remaining lockdown measures will now expire July 19, BoJo said. Previously, measures were supposed to expire on June 21, a day the government had deemed &quot;Freedom Day&quot;. Instead, the UK will need to wait another month, as BoJo s…</span>

Real Vision senior editor Ash Bennington welcomes Ed Harrison, managing editor at Real Vision, to the Daily Briefing to discuss the market’s reaction to last week’s CPI print as well as Bitcoin’s rebound. The pair will analyze the fall in bond yields and stock market growth as investors anticipate the FOMC meeting scheduled for Tuesday and continued dovish FED policies. Additionally, they will examine Bitcoin’s recent reversal as Paul Tudor Jones and Elon Musk publicly state their support.

Oil prices were volatile this week on headline-driven trade but still managed to grind higher

	

	

	
The latest CPI print came in above expectations again, reinforcing already widespread inflation fears and adding more fuel to the commodity rally

	

	

	
RIN prices have been surging this year, but a headline suggesting the Biden administration is considering options to help refiners sent ethanol RINs and the gasoline crack tumbling Friday

                    <span>The Fed&#x27;s Punchbowl Is Overflowing Into Money Markets: What Happens Next

            
Last Wednesday, when the Fed&#x27;s reverse repo facility hit just shy of half a trillion dollars (it has since risen to a new record $547.8BN), we said that &quot;Wall Street Scrambles To Figure Out What Comes Next&quot; in which we showed that while some banks expect the Fed to hike its IOER and Reverse Repo rates (such as BofA, JPM and Wrightson ICAP), others see the Fed standing pat again (Jefferies, Credit Suisse and BMO), a case bolstered by the WSJ&#x27;s Fed whisperer, Michael Darby, who suggested that the Fed was ok with the reverse repo being at half a trillion, and thus is unlikely to make any changes to its adminstered rates.


Alas, with the Street evenly split in two camps on the fate of the IOER/RRP rates…</span>

By Jack Phillips of The Epoch Times


The top U.S. general warned Thursday that the Chinese regime is increasing its military capacity at a “very serious and sustained rate” and said it could pose a threat to worldwide stability and peace.


Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that it’s necessary the United States “retain our competitive and technological edge” over the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which comes after President Joe Biden and Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin raised similar concerns in recent days about the rhetoric coming from the CCP—as the United States and China have remained intransigent over Taiwan, the CCP’s human rights violations, and dispu…</span>

By Chetan Ahya, Morgan Stanley&#x27;s Chief Economist and Global Head of Economics


The Paradigm Shift


At a recent group dinner, I was asked to identify the most significant development in global macro I had witnessed during my three-year stint in New York. I expect that many people would point to the pandemic and the structural changes it has brought to the ways we work and live. But I think the bigger story is how the pandemic has triggered a paradigm shift in how corporate profits and wages will be distributed within national income. As this mega-trend reverses in the US, the tide will turn in favor of higher inflation and economic cycles will run hotter but shorter, in my view.

Authored by Ian Birrell via UnHerd (emphasis ours),


Just over a year ago, I stumbled across an intriguing scientific paper. It suggested the pandemic that was ripping around the world was “uniquely adapted to infect humans”; it was “not typical of a normal zoonotic infection” since it first appeared with “exceptional” ability to enter human cells. The author of the paper, Nikolai Petrovsky, was frank about the disease when we spoke back then, saying its adaptability was either “a remarkable coincidence or a sign of human intervention”. He even broke the scientific omertà by daring to admit that “no one can say a laboratory leak is not a possibility”.

In an ironic twist on their mission statement &quot;Sempra Supra&quot; (which could be translated &quot;Always Higher&quot;), a wildlife manager at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS) discovered more than a million dollars worth of cocaine on a beach last month while checking on sea turtle nests, according to local newspaper Florida Today. 


Angy Chambers, a 45th Civil Engineer Squadron wildlife manager conducting sea turtle nesting surveys in late May, found 24 packages, collectively weighing 65 pounds, of cocaine.

“If anyone can do it, then no one should”


It’s always some combination of amusement and frustration when you hear the incessant admonition of crypto-skeptics (crypto-denialists?) who think they’re being original when they come up with this version of FUD (Fear-Uncertainty-Doubt):



“Bitcoin is not a limited supply because people can create an infinite number of crypto currencies! Check mate, crypto-cucks”



This is the “Without government, who will build the roads?” argument of decentralization and crypto. When my last post ran on Zerohedge, the comment section had a lot of this:

                    <span>As Biden Swipes At Trump, G-7 Leaders Hail US President As &quot;Part Of The Club&quot; Again

            
Biden capped the G-7 summit with a victorious sounding &quot;America is back at the table&quot; - in what many are noting was an obvious swipe at former President Trump. But many are also observing the whole summit appeared more like a multi-day long photo-op where Biden was formally admitted into being &quot;part of the club&quot;.



French President Emmanuel Macron to Joe Biden: “What we need is cooperation. I think it’s great to have a US President who is part of the club.”

I don’t know about you, but I thought an American President is supposed to LEAD, not be “part of the club”.

Of course, Biden nods. pic.twitter.com/RjzwwLQ8No

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


An election assessment conducted in a Pennsylvania county months ago and quietly released to the public in recent weeks uncovered five errors, including three linked to Dominion Voting Systems, whose election management system is used in the county, the assessing firm said.







Wake Technology Services Inc. (Wake TSI), a Pennsylvania-based firm, conducted the assessment in Fulton County. Workers visited the county’s offices late last year and about a month later, on Feb. 9.


The assessment was meant to review the mail-in ballots in the county and explore whether conduct relating to absentee ballot requests, distribution, receipt, and count…</span>

                    <span>Bye Bye Bibi: Israel Parliament Vote Narrowly Unseats Netanyahu

            
Though nothing seems to move fast in Israeli politics - after four national votes in two years and multiple failed attempts at forming a governing coalition - Israel&#x27;s longest serving prime minister is finally out for good.


On Sunday Israel&#x27;s parliament voted to approve the new coalition government under Naftali Bennet and Yair Lapid, with Bennet being sworn in as prime minister following the narrow 60-59 vote in Knesset. Netanyahu&#x27;s 12-years in office comes to a close and he now faces criminal charges - no longer under the protection and legal immunity afforded by the PM&#x27;s office - over prior corruption cases.


BBC/Reuters: Naftali Bennett (right) ended Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s long tenure in office.

“The [Bitcoin] volatility we have seen is an unexpected function of what I would call market manipulation by Elon Musk,” said Magda Wierzycka, one of the richest women in South Africa and CEO of financial services company Sygnia.


“If that happens to a listed company, he would be investigated and severely sanctioned by [the] SEC.”

An Arizona state Senator has warned US Attorney General Merrick Garland that he&#x27;ll &#x27;spend time in prison&#x27; if he interferes with the 2020 post-election audit, after Garland announced on Friday that the Justice Department will look into whether any federal laws were broken - and claimed the state was employing &#x27;abnormal&#x27; methods.







&quot;Some jurisdictions, based on disinformation, have utilized abnormal post-election audit methodologies that may put the integrity of the voting process at risk and undermine public confidence in our democracy,&quot; said Garland.

Authored by Nick Giambruno via InternationalMan.com,


On April 5, 1933, under the pretext of a national emergency, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for U.S. citizens to own gold.


The decree forced Americans to sell their gold at an artificially low “official price.” If they refused, the government could hit them with stiff penalties: a $10,000 fine (equivalent to $205,000 today) and/or up to 10 years in prison.


The government blatantly stole wealth from the American people.


Many worry the U.S. government might confiscate gold again if it becomes desperate enough. I don’t think those fears are unfounded. The U.S. government’s abysmal fina…</span>

Since a Saturday1:30am mass shooting on Austin&#x27;s crowded 6th street left 14 people wounded, at least two of them critically, there&#x27;s been a manhunt underway for what police said were two suspects. A somewhat desperate and woefully understaffed Austin Police Department (given a prior year-long effort to &quot;defund the police&quot;) urged the public for clues or cell phone videos which might reveal the gunman&#x27;s (or possibly multiple shooters) identity. 


On Sunday late morning Austin PD have announced an arrest has been made of one of the suspects, though few details were given in the statement, which underscored that authorities are still seeking information.

It&#x27;s not surprising that last week&#x27;s 5.0% CPI reading in headline consumer prices year-over-year in May was the fastest pace of increase in more than a decade. The Fed&#x27;s destructive money-pumping of $120 billion of Treasury and GSE debt and supply chain disruptions have unleashed an inflationary monster that Fed members swear is only &quot;transitory.&quot; 


Days ago, BofA economists told their clients that the evidence of shortages and inflation continues to grow with every passing day, as does the list of reasons to reject the problem as purely temporary.

Commentary authored by Anders Corr via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),


Don’t mess with Texas. Chip Roy, a Republican representative to Congress from the 21st District, including parts of Austin and San Antonio, is taking on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in a big, Texan, way. Chip proposes to ban CCP members from purchasing land in America. It’s a short, sweet, and brilliantly-cutting edge bill that should be voted into law ASAP.

                    <span>Invesco Launches 2 &quot;Zero Fee&quot; ETFs As Sponsors Compete To Offer Cheapest Funds

            
Prices are rising on all types of goods and services across the US. Yet even with retail market participation at all-time highs, fee competition among asset managers and ETF sponsors - which has always been particularly fierce - is heating up once again. The biggest ETF providers like BlackRock and State Street already charge fractions of a penny on the dollar for some of the most popular ETFs (which enjoy AUMs in the hundreds of billions of dollars), so how much lower can the bar go?







Well, Bloomberg reported Friday that Atlanta-based Invesco is launching two new ETFs that will have all management fees waived for the rest of the year, further aggravating the industry&#x27;s price war. The f…</span>

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


A doctor who argued that the UK’s COVID-19 lockdown should remain in place indefinitely may have inadvertently revealed his true thoughts by letting slip the comment, “sadly, it can’t be forever.”







Yes, really.


The remark was made by National Health Action Party’s Doctor Richard Taylor during a fiery interview hosted by Julia Hartley-Brewer on TalkRADIO.


Hartley-Brewer challenged Taylor’s ‘zero COVID’ argument after the doctor suggested that some form of lockdown should remain in place until the virus is entirely eradicated, which is a scientific impossibility.

Lumber futures on Chicago Mercantile Exchange posted their largest-ever weekly loss, extending a multi-week decline as sawmill output increases and buyers hold off on purchases, according to Bloomberg. 


On Friday, lumber futures fell 5.61% to $1,059.20 per thousand board feet. For the week, prices plunged 18%, the most significant decline since 1986, one year before the 1987 stock market crash. 







Lumber prices have crashed 40% from the record high in May of around $1,711.

Authored by Mike Shedlock via MishTalk.com,


Let&#x27;s investigate the relationship between real interest rates and the price of gold.







Real means inflation adjusted. 


I calculated the real interest rate by subtracting year-over-year CPI from the current 3-month T-bill yield. 


One could also use the Fed Funds Rate or 1-month T-Bill rate as the yields are all about the same. 







The following chart puts the negative interest rate theory to the test,


Real Interest Rate vs Price of Gold 







The chart above shows the monthly gold close, not monthly highs. That explains why the 1980 top does not show.

                    <span>Thor Industries Now Has $14 Billion Order Backlog Amid Booming Demand For RVs 

            
About two months after we discussed recreational vehicles are &quot;on pace for a blowout year&quot; and &quot;sales just hit an all-time high,&quot; we got the latest confirmation from Thor Industries CEO Bob Martin. He spoke with Jim Cramer on &quot;Mad Money&quot; earlier this week about the manufacturer&#x27;s massive order backlog. 







Thor Industries — Airstream, Heartland RV, Jayco, Livin Lite RV, and others — first began to experience an uptick in sales after lockdowns ended in May and June 2020. Without a vaccine, people were too afraid to fly or stay in hotels or resorts, so they bought campers and traveled. The RV industry also saw a lot of first-time buyers, especially with the millennial generation.

The media has caught a not-so-curious case of amnesia when it comes to Attorney General Merrick Garland - who&#x27;s been royally pissing off Biden supporters after the DOJ has shown an increased tendency to side with the Trump administration in legal wranglings that were considered &#x27;bombshell&#x27; controversies under AG Barr.


Unpacking the hypocrisy is legal scholar Jonathan Turley, who notes the MSM&#x27;s glaring double standards:

                    <span>Visualizing The History Of US Inflation Over 100 Years

            
Is inflation rising?


The consumer price index (CPI), an index used as a proxy for inflation in consumer prices, offers some answers. In 2020, inflation dropped to 1.4%, the lowest rate since 2015. By comparison, inflation sits around 5.0% as of June 2021.







Given how the economic shock of COVID-19 depressed prices, rising price levels make sense. However, as Visual Capitalist&#x27;s Dorothy Neufeld notes, other variables, such as a growing money supply and rising raw materials costs, could factor into rising inflation.


To show current price levels in context, this Markets in a Minute chart from New York Life Investments shows the history of inflation over 100 years.

By John Sexton of HotAir


Last year there was a proposal circulating in the Seattle City Council to consider making drug abuse and mental disorders a defense against most misdemeanor crimes. In essence, that would have been a green light for an army of homeless shoplifters to steal at will knowing they’d face no chance of being punished. But it appears Seattle police have decided to do something about aggressive shoplifters. This Wednesday they arrested 53 shoplifters in 9 separate stores:



“These are organized groups that hit retailers with the sole purpose of stealing to either resell them or use them as currency for other things,” said Sgt. Randy Huserik, public information officer for the Seattle P…</span>

Drug cartels such as the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, or CJNG, have upgraded their arsenals with an elite special forces unit, according to atlas.news. 


CJNG released a video of their &quot;Grupo Elite&quot; otherwise known as special forces team, &quot;outfitted with signal jammers and heavily modified rifles,&quot; said atlas.news. The video also shows the unit in what appears to be a bulletproof vehicle. 


CJNG released the video (watch here) on the prospects of expanding their control into Naucalpan de Juárez, a city located just northwest of Mexico City in the neighboring State of Mexico. They appear to be threatening local drug lord Nestor Arturo Lopez Arellano, otherwise known as &quot;El 20.&quot;

This special report looks at the ‘hot topic’ of ‘hot’ inflation, and asks if it is really back to stay 

	

	

	
Inflation is crucial for financial markets, but we lack an accurate economic theory of what causes it, leading to inaccurate modelling and policy/forecasting errors

	

	

	
We draw a broader framework of the eight structural factors currently driving global inflation: a ‘bullwhip’ effect; the Fed; fiscal policy; speculators; psychology; Chinese demand; labour vs. capital; and the role of global supply chains/the distribution of production

Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,


Inflation is making headlines all over the country, but the mainstream media is not being honest about the true severity of the crisis.  We are being told that the official rate of inflation is still in single digits, but what we aren’t being told is that the way inflation is calculated has changed dramatically over the years.  In fact, according to Forbes “the government has changed the way it calculates inflation more than 20 times” over the past 30 years.  The rate of inflation directly affects so many other things in our system, and the government would like to keep that number as low as possible.  So they tinkered and tinkered with …</span>

                    <span>Ford&#x27;s Electric F-150 Lightning Reservations Pass 100,000

            
While Tesla&#x27;s Cybertruck was revealed far in advance of Ford&#x27;s F-150 Lightning electric pickup, the Lightning has several things going for it.


First, it actually appears to exist, and is planned to roll off the assembly line in Spring 2022 - unlike the Cybertruck, the current status of which is up in the air. Second, the Ford F-150 Lightning now has 100,000 reservations in just the 3 short weeks since its introduction. 


Emma Bergg, Ford spokeswoman, told the Detroit Free Press on Thursday: &quot;We&#x27;re super excited about the demand. Reservations are getting added all the time.&quot;


 





The Lightning was released 3 weeks ago and packs 563 horsepower and 775 lb.-ft. of torque. In the first 48 hours after its release, the company received 44,500 pre-orders. President Biden was at the truck&#x27;s release last month and even gave the Lightning a test drive and some free press. &quot;This sucker is quick,&quot; Biden said, after taking off in the truck on a closed course. 


By comparison, since 2019, Tesla&#x27;s Cybertruck has accumulated over 1 million reservations. 


Tesla&#x27;s official website doesn&#x27;t denote an expected delivery date. As of May, it was expected that the Cybertruck would begin production in &quot;late 2021&quot;. 


Ford, meanwhile, is taking $100 refundable deposits for the Lightning and the truck starts at $39,974.

Authored by Brett Wilkins via via CommonDreams.org,


Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has accused the US-backed international financial system of blocking the country&#x27;s access to Covid-19 vaccines under the COVAX program, even though Venezuela has paid all but $10 million of the $120 million it owes.


Appearing in a televised address, Rodríguez said Venezuela was unable to pay the remaining $10 million because it was being blocked from transferring funds to the Switzerland-based GAVI Vaccine Alliance, which directs COVAX. &quot;The financial system that also hides behind the U.S. lobby has the power to block resources that can be used to immunize the population of Ve…</span>

                    <span>Gluten-Free Generation: Children With Celiac Disease Doubles In 25-Years 

            
According to a new study, the rising prevalence of celiac disease in Europe is absolutely astonishing and has more than doubled over the last 25 years. 


Researchers at Marche Polytechnic University in Ancona, Italy, found that celiac disease, sometimes called celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause painful damage to small intestines over time, doubled in school children compared to a similar study by the same group 25 years ago.







Approximately 7,760 children aged from five to 11 in eight provinces of Italy were given a blood test to see if they had specific gene mutations which predispose them…</span>

Boring. I never thought I would say that about gold prices, but the gold price action for the last nine months has been boring.


And that’s actually a good thing. Why?


After beginning with the boring part, I’ll explain. Let me unpack this…


Gold prices hit an all-time high of $2,069 per ounce on August 6, 2020.


The yield-to-maturity on the 10-year Treasury note hit an interim low of 0.508% on August 4, 2020. The near simultaneity of those two benchmarks is no coincidence.


The interest rate on the 10-year note has been practically the sole determinant of the dollar price of gold since that August convergence of low rates and high gold prices.


But that isn’…</span>

                    <span>Baltimore City Responds After Dozens Of Businesses Threaten Not To Pay Taxes

            
This weekend, the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) closed down multiple city streets around the Inner Harbor, in a stretch called &quot;Fells Point,&quot; after dozens of local businesses threatened the new city government, run by Mayor Brandon Scott, to not pay taxes because they&#x27;re &quot;fed up and frustrated&quot; with the outburst of violence. 


Last week, 37 restaurants and small businesses sent a letter to the mayor&#x27;s office titled &quot;Letter to City Leaders From Fells Point Business Leaders.&quot; They threatened to stop paying city taxes and other fees until &quot;basic and essential municipal services are restored.&quot; This comes as Madam State&#x27;s Attorney Marilyn Mosby halted petty crimes during the pandemic and made suc…</span>

Citadel has reached a settlement with the British hedge fund it accused of trying to plunder one of its senior traders in an effort to get to its algorithmic &quot;secret sauce&quot;.


GSA Capital Partners LLC and Citadel announced the settlement late last week after Citadel accused the fund of obtaining &quot;closely guarded&quot; trading strategies when it hired the employee in question, Vedat Cologlu, according to Bloomberg. 


GSA said of the settlement that the two firms “recognize and respect the importance and value of the other’s rights over their confidential information and intellectual property.”

                    <span>China Urges US &amp; Russia To Reduce Their Nuclear Arsenals

            
Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday called on the US and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals during the UN-backed Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.


While Washington is constantly hyping up China’s nuclear arsenal, it is only a fraction of what the US and Russia possess. Estimates on the higher-end put China’s nuclear stockpile at 350 warheads. Russia has about 6,350 warheads, while the US has 5,800.







Despite the numbers, the US complains that Beijing does not want to enter arms control talks. But China has no motivation to do so unless the US and Russia make an effort to reduce their arsenals. Regardless, the US continues to blame the issue on China.


&quot;To date, China has rebuffed US efforts to initiate bilateral talks on risk reduction and strategic stability,&quot; Robert Wood, the US ambassador for disarmament, said at the conference.


Besides having way more nuclear weapons than Beijing, the US is also encircling China with military hardware. The US has plans to deploy medium-range missiles near China that were previously banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the US withdrew from in 2019.







Wang took a shot at the US for its plans to further militarize Asia which he characterized as undermining regional stability.


&quot;China opposes the development and deployment of regional and global missile defense systems by a certain country that undermine strategic stability, and China opposes the deployment of land-based intermediate-range ballistic missiles by the same country in the neighborhood of other countries,&quot; he said.

Pakistan is expected to spend more than a billion dollars in the next fiscal year to import COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate around 100 million people. The trouble is, anti-vaccine groups have sprung up around the country and have deterred some from taking the vaccine. In response, one local government in Pakistan has a new weapon in its war chest against vaccine hesitancy: disable the SIM cards of mobile phones of people who decline to get jabbed, according to RT News. 


Punjab Health Minister Yasmin Rashid decided on Thursday during a meeting with the Punjab provincial government and military officials that anyone who denied the COVID-19 jab will have their SIM cards disabled at &quot;a certain time.&quot;

                    <span>The Fed Is Wrong: Inflation Is Sticky

            
Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


The Fed&#x27;s god-like powers will be revealed for what they really are: artifice and illusion.


The Fed will be proven catastrophically wrong about inflation for the simple reason that inflation isn&#x27;t transitory, it&#x27;s sticky: when prices rise due to real-world scarcities and higher costs, they stay high and then move higher as expectations catch up with reality.


Consider the dynamic of Fed-inflated bubbles raising rents. The house that once sold for $200,000 is sold to a pool of investors for $800,000, and the property taxes, insurance and debt service rise accordingly: even though the house didn&#x27;t change, thanks to the Fed&#x27;s bubble, the entire cost structure is higher.

                    <span>Putin Reveals Personal Thoughts On Trump &amp; Biden In Rare NBC Interview

            
Russian President Vladimir Putin this week sat down for an interview with a US media outlet for the first time in nearly three years. NBC&#x27;s Keir Simmons talked to Putin for about 90 minutes, and released a teaser segment Friday night. 


Perhaps the most interesting part of the conversation centered on the Russian leader&#x27;s perspective on American politics and his personal thoughts and comparison of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Putin called the former president &quot;extraordinary&quot; and &quot;talented&quot; while noting that Biden is &quot;radically different&quot; and is a quintessential &quot;career man&quot; in politics.

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


A UK government adviser and former Communist Party member Susan Michie says that mask mandates and social distancing should continue “forever” and that people should adopt such behaviour just as they did with wearing seatbelts.







Michie, who is a Professor of Health Psychology at UCL and a leading member of SAGE, said such control measures should become part of people’s “normal” routine behaviour.


&quot;Vaccines are a really important part of pandemic control but it is only one part. [A] test, trace and isolate system, [as well as] border controls, are really essential. And the third thing is people’s behaviour. That is, the behaviour of social dist…</span>

The Fed’s destructive money-pumping has many victims, but chief among these is the Wall Street financial narrative itself. 


It emits not a whiff about the patent absurdity of the Fed’s monthly purchase of $120 billion of treasury and GSE debt under current circumstances; and treats with complete respect and seriousness the juvenile word game known as “thinking about thinking about tapering” by which the clowns in the Eccles Building fearfully attempt to placate the liquidity-intoxicated speculators on Wall Street.

                    <span>One Shocking Chart That Has Farmers Trembling With Fear 

            
Readers know by now that the Western US is facing one of the most severe droughts in years. We&#x27;ve documented (read here &amp; here) this spring of a &quot;megadrought&quot; sweeping across states like California and Nevada as risks of a second Dust Bowl increase by the day. 


But in this note, let&#x27;s dive deeper into the drought and how it&#x27;s impacting farmers and the potential consequences it could have on crops. Meteorologists at BAMWX have published data on surface soil moisture over 20 years. Surface soil moisture is the water that is in the upper 4 inches and available for various types of plants. They found that the 2021 moisture deficit for early June is the worst it has ever been in two decades. 







BAMWX&#x27;s Vince Bryan says the moisture deficit in the soil is &quot;a concern&quot; as it may impact plant development. Soil moisture plays a crucial role in agricultural monitoring, drought and flood forecasting, forest fire prediction, and water supply management. 


Soil moisture observations can alert of impending drought, such as what&#x27;s been underway in the Western US this year. 


What this means is that soil moisture deficits can dry crops and make them more vulnerable to pests. Even short-term drought can cause damage to crops, mainly during critical stages of crop development, such as after planting or during flowering. 


If the drought persists, crop yields could come underestimates this year and result in elevated agricultural prices.

Lately I have been thinking a lot about the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum while at the same time the world is witnessing the inexorable move to crypto in realtime. Some may question the latter half of that assertion, given that the latest FUD cycle against cryptos has been one of the most intense that I’ve witnessed since getting involved in the space in 2013.







Behind the FUD we see actions. We see Russia dumping dollar assets (can you blame them?).

                    <span>Fossil Fuels Aren&#x27;t Dying, They&#x27;re Shifting To National And State Backed Companies 

            
Despite the activist shareholder battles, calls for ESG changes and just outright negative press about fossil fuels, it looks like rumors of oil&#x27;s death have been greatly exaggerated. Fossil fuels aren&#x27;t dying - rather, their output is just being shifted to national and state owned companies. 


Even as the supermajor oil companies shrink in size and adhere to incessant criticism, fossil-fuel demand holds strong, according to Yahoo Finance. Activists have been the busiest they have been in years...



Recent weeks saw Exxon and Chevron rebuked by their own shareholders over climate concerns, while Shell lost a lawsuit in the Hague over the pace of its shift away from oil and gas.

Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,


In my entire lifetime, this is the worst that drought conditions have ever been in the western half of the country.  During the past 20 years, the amount of territory in the West considered to be suffering from exceptional drought has never gone higher than 11 percent until now.  Today, that number is sitting at 27 percent.  The term “mega-drought” is being thrown around a lot these days to describe what is happening, but this isn’t just a drought.  This is a true national emergency, and it is really starting to affect our food supply.

There should be little doubt that the timing is intentional: China on Thursday passed its sweeping new law to &#x27;safeguard&#x27; Chinese businesses and entities from Western and especially US sanctions, just hours ahead of President Joe Biden sitting down with G-7 leaders in Cornwall to argue for a common stance on curtailing China&#x27;s influence. AFP observes: &quot;China&#x27;s quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left European and American companies shocked and facing &#x27;irreconcilable&#x27; compliance issues, two top business groups said Friday, despite Beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment.&quot;

Authored by Caitlin Johnstone via Medium.com,


So in case you haven’t been keeping up it’s been pretty thoroughly confirmed that the US government’s highly anticipated UFO report due this month won’t contain any significant revelations and certainly won’t verify anyone’s ideas about these phenomena being extraterrestrial in origin, but it absolutely will contain fearmongering that UFOs could be evidence that the US has fallen dangerously behind Russian and Chinese technological development in the cold war arms race.

On Wednesday, President Biden told US troops stationed in the UK that the Joint Chiefs told him &quot;the greatest threat facing America&quot; is &quot;global warming&quot; - a curious pivot from &quot;white supremacy.&quot;



Sooo.... White Supremacy was the biggest problem in America up until Hunter said the n-word.

Now we&#x27;re back to climate change... got it.

— Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) June 10, 2021


On day later, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs &#x27;corrected&#x27; Biden, asserting instead that the biggest threats facing the US are China and Russia, according to US News, (and who allegedly had a big role in scamming half of pandemic unemployment funds to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars…</span>

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Remember when networks and legal experts (correctly) denounced President Donald Trump for his attacks on judges who ruled against him?


Two years ago, I ran a column noting that Democrats were adopting the same attacks on conservative judges but the media was entirely silent.


Now,  California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democrats are lambasting a federal judge who ruled in favor of gun rights in a recent decision — accusing him of being in the pocket of the NRA and a danger to the country.  The response to Newsom’s attack from all of those same media and legal experts has ranged from outright support to conspicuous silence.

                    <span>Former ADT Tech Sentenced To Prison After Spying On Naked Women And Couples Having Sex

            
A former ADT security technician was sentenced to four years and four months in federal prison for repeatedly hacking into customers&#x27; video feeds in North Texas and spying on attractive women and couples engaging in sexual activity inside their homes, according to CBS Dallas.


Tesforo Aviles (via the Daily Mail)


Telesforo Aviles, 35, pleaded guilty to computer fraud in January - admitting to adding his personal email address to customers&#x27; &quot;ADT Pulse&quot; accounts, which gave him real-time access to video feeds from their homes. In some instances he claimed he needed to add himself temporarily to &quot;test&quot; the system, while in other cases he added himself without customer knowledge.


According to plea papers, Aviles watched numerous videos of naked women and couples engaging in sexual activity, which he admitted he would view for sexual gratification.


Aviles accessed roughly 200 customer accounts over 9,600 times without their consent.


&quot;This deliberate and calculated invasion of privacy is arguably more harmfrul than if I had installed no security system and my house had been burglarized,&quot; said one female victim in a statement to the court. &quot;This sick and corrupt individual&#x27;s actions will have a lasting emotional and mental toll on me.&quot;


&quot;This defendant, entrusted with safeguarding customers’ homes, instead intruded on their most intimate moments,&quot; Acting US Attorney Perak Shah said in January.


Aviles faced up to five years in prison.


Unfortunately for the victims, they couldn&#x27;t opt-out of Aviles&#x27; intrusions like Amazon Sidewalk customers. You never know who&#x27;s on the other end.

Via MoneyMetals.com,


As foreign governments reportedly accumulate gold and de-dollarize their sovereign wealth funds, a Republican congressman is asking tough questions of the U.S. Treasury about its secretive gold activities.


Representative Alex Mooney (R-WV) – sponsor of the Gold Reserve Transparency Act of 2021 (H.R. 3526) to require the first true audit of America’s gold in decades – wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen this week requesting detailed information about the U.S. gold holdings delegated to the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund and posed other questions.

On Thursday the state-run Central Bank of Cuba (BCC) announced that it&#x27;s suspending all deposits in US dollars due to what it called America&#x27;s &quot;economic blockade&quot; of the country&#x27;s banking system. 


&quot;Given the obstacles imposed by the US economic blockade for the Cuban banking system to depositing abroad cash in US dollars collected in the country, the decision has been made to temporarily stop the acceptance of bills in that currency by the Cuban banking and finance system,&quot; national media cited the bank as saying.







The decision will go into effect starting June 21, and for now it appears indefinite with no end date for the restrictive measures being issued.

Authored by Brad Polumbo via The Foundation for Economic Education,


With pandemic restrictions finally being wound down around the country, the economy should be roaring back to life. But we’ve seen much more muted job growth than expected, and we have a record-breaking 9.3 million unfilled job openings while millions of Americans languish on unemployment welfare. What’s going on?







Well, a new small business survey reveals two key problems plaguing our economy.

After a pretty impressive start on Mars that included NASA&#x27;s Perseverance rover deploying a small robotic, coaxial helicopter called Ingenuity, the rover is beginning a 3-mile road trip across the Red Planet to search for signs of life, according to NASA JPL.


Since Perseverance landed on Mars in February, it&#x27;s taken tens of thousands of images, and its microphones have picked up sounds from the planet. Ingenuity has seven successful flights under its belt, testing if its aeronautical design can survive the planet&#x27;s thin atmosphere.

I’m not much of a Led Zeppelin fan. In fact, I have an unnatural animus towards Led Zeppelin. Outside of Houses of the Holy and “Fool in the Rain” and “Misty Mountain Hop” I pretty much don’t have anything good to say about them.


That’s weird coming from someone of my demographic — Gen X, white suburban male who grew up on a steady diet of what’s today “Classic Rock” radio.


That said, I admit that part of this animus toward Zep is unfair because it comes from the insanity of my friends’ obsession with them to the exclusion of nearly all other types and kinds of music when we were teenagers getting our artistic imprint on.

                    <span>Watch: Arkansas State Trooper Flips Pregnant Woman&#x27;s SUV As She Looks For A Safe Place To Pull Over

            
An Arkansas State Police trooper is being sued after running out of patience while trying to initiate a traffic stop, and eventually flipping over a pregnant woman&#x27;s vehicle during a traffic stop on a major highway.


Dashcam video of the incident was released this week showing the driver, Nicole Harper, traveling down I-67 when Senior Cpl. Rodney Dunn tried to pull her over for speeding. Instead of pulling over, she continued down the highway, moving over to the right lane and slowing down with her hazard lights on.


While the woman claims she was looking for a safe place to pull over, the officer ran out of patience. In the video the Arkansas State Police trooper is seen using a PIT maneuver &quot;which caused Harper’s car to crash into the concrete median and flip,&quot; according to Fox 16. 





“In my head I was going to lose the baby,” Harper told Fox 16. The video shows the officer asking her: “Why didn’t you stop?” 


She responded: “Because I didn’t feel it was safe.”


The officer then says, &quot;well this is where you ended up.”


“I thought it would be safe to wait until the exit,” the driver pleads. The officer responds: “no ma’am, you pull over when law enforcement stops you.”﻿


Jalopnik noted that &quot;Dunn gave Harper all of two minutes before he nudged her car&quot; and that the driver was &quot;less than a mile from the nearest exit with a wide shoulder.&quot;


In the interim, Harper did just what the Arkansas State Police’s Driver License Study Guide says you are supposed to do when being pulled over. “What to do When You Are Stopped,” number one says to use, “emergency flashers to indicate to the officer that you are seeking a safe place to stop,” Fox 16 reported.


“I did slow down, I turned on my hazards, I thought I was doing the right thing,” Harper said.﻿

Authored by Glenn Greenwald via greenwald.substack.com,


The Trump Justice Department in 2017 and early 2018 issued subpoenas to Apple to obtain the communications records of at least two Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Eric Swalwell (D-CA). According to The New York Times, DOJ prosecutors attempting to determine who leaked classified information to the media about Russiagate suspected the two House Democrats were the culprits, and to prove that, they obtained their communications records as well as those of family members, including minor children.

Today&#x27;s Consumer Inflation Cycle Comes With Yesteryear Denial, Problems &amp; Consequences


Consumer price inflation is experiencing its most significant increases in decades. Yet, reported inflation does not capture the full scale and breadth of experienced inflation. I never thought the US would experience rampant inflation again, but based on the 1970s price measurement methods, the US experienced double-digit inflation in the past twelve months.

In May, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.6%, pushing the twelve-month increase to 5%, the most significant increase since 2008. Core CPI rose 0.7%, …</span>

                    <span>&quot;Spooked The Market&quot; - Corn, Soy, Soyoil Slump Amid Biofuel Law 

            
President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration is mulling over new measures to provide relief to U.S. oil refiners pressured from biofuel blending mandates. This has sent corn and soybean futures and soyoil futures lower on Friday. There were also new weather models forecasting crop-boosting rains in parts of the U.S. Midwest and Northern Plains, resulting in declines in grain prices. 



&quot;The biofuel news spooked the market, you&#x27;ve got some rains in the Dakotas ... and the palm oil was down 4% to 5% overnight. That is all weighing on it,&quot; Craig Turner, senior ag broker at Daniels Trading, told Reuters.

                    <span>UK To Extend Lockdown One Month As Indian Variant Spooks Officials Into Vaccine Scramble

            
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to delay the country&#x27;s &quot;freedom day&quot; from lockdowns by just under one month - from June 21 to July 19 - after the &#x27;Delta variant&#x27; COVID-19 strain from India exploded 240% in one week, as was first reported by The Sun, and later confirmed by the Financial Times via comments by England&#x27;s Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitley, who requested the delay.



Under plans drawn up to be announced on Monday, a two-week review will be included meaning Covid restrictions could be dropped on July 5 if hospitalisations stay down.


But multiple sources told the Sun the chances of lifting restrictions as planned on June 21 were close to zero - in a massive bl…</span>

                    <span>Ex-Credit Suisse Bond Trader &quot;Savant&quot; Made Millions With Risky, Concentrated Bets

            
Earlier this week, we joked about a Bloomberg story claiming a 30-year-old Credit Suisse credit-trading wunderkind was being cut adrift by the bank amid a bout of &quot;de-risking&quot; inspired by the twin blowups caused by Greensill and Archegos, which might cost the bank up to $10 billion.


When the trader, Moroccan-born Hamza Lemssouguer, was poached by Citadel (to join the company&#x27;s hedge fund division as a portfolio manager for a new credit fund), Credit Suisse managed to keep him from leaving with the promise that the firm would seed a new fund for him under its asset management division.

                    <span>&quot;We Are Building Up To A Big Accident&quot; - Gap Between 10Y Yields And CPI Is The Highest Since 1980

            
Even though US CPI smashed expectations again, Deustche Bank&#x27;s chief credit strategist Jim Reid correctly points out that &quot;the data isn’t going to change anyone’s mind of whether inflation is transitory or not.&quot;


Still, as an aside for those who still care about fundamentals, he notes that the current gap between 10yr US yields (c.1.5%) and US CPI (5.0%) is a whopping 3.5%, the highest since 1980. In fact, the gap has only been more negative for 10 months in the last 70 years, all of which were in 1974, 1975 or 1980.







Another way of visualizing the unprecedented divergence between core inflation and 10Y yields is the following scattergram from Longview economics:







While such a deeply negative (albeit crude) proxy for real yields (as opposed to the manipulated ones where the Fed is implicitly setting real rates with its purchases of TIPS) is great for financial conditions today, the DB credit strategist asks, rhetorically, if &quot;we are building up to a big accident with such a mismatch between inflation and bond yields?&quot;


And just as rhetorically, Reid concludes that despite this stunning observation, &quot;no-one is going to have a different opinion to what they had yesterday though&quot; (although If anyone&#x27;s mind has changed, Reid would love to hear from you).

On June 1st, Mudrick Capital went from hero to zero in the eyes of Reddit&#x27;s Wall Street Bets rebels as the hedge fund scooped up $230 million in newly issued stock at an above market price ($27.12), prompting Redditors to herald the fund as the company&#x27;s savior and sparking a bullish move in the stock - now that the firm was (marginally) better capitalized.



In our view, this is not mindless dilution, but rather this is very smart raising of cash so that we can grow this company... to many of you on Twitter, to grow YOUR company. Watch out naysayers, $AMC is going to play on offense again. Here we come! {5 of 5}

Readers may remember earlier this year when an accident at the Emergent Biosolutions lab in Baltimore led to millions of J&amp;J and AstraZeneca doses being ruined (after workers cross-contaminated them with ingredients from AstraZeneca jabs being produced in the same factory).


Since the incident, the FDA has been reviewing safety and production procedures at the facility. But despite the US government handing over control to J&amp;J, attempts to re-start production have been in limbo, and according to the NYT, another 60MM doses produced at the facility didn&#x27;t meet the agency&#x27;s safety standards.

The pace of GDP growth is likely to peak in Q2. That makes sense given the amount fiscal stimulus in the first few months.

	

	

	
But it is the pace of deceleration that matters more, and that remains an open question.

	

	

	
This is interest because the pace will affect inflation, yields, and the Fed.

	

	

	
At the moment, it looks “peakish” from GDP expectations to Fed hike timing to CPI forecasts.

The US continues to downplay expectations for the upcoming summit between President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin that is scheduled for June 16th in Geneva.


The meeting comes as US-Russia relations are at their lowest point since the Cold War. Despite the dangerous path the two largest nuclear powers are on, the Biden administration doesn’t seem interested in any diplomatic breakthroughs.

One day before the &quot;most important CPI print in history&quot;, we showed the latest JPM Treasury Client survey and pointed out that &quot;there were virtually no traders left to short Treasurys, with all bears already on board&quot; as net short interest had hit an all time high. As a result, even a red hot CPI had been fully priced in by now, and the result would be sharply lower yields as we got another massive short squeeze, this time in rates.

Update (2000ET): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday that it will convene an &quot;emergency meeting&quot; of its advisers on June 18th to discuss rare but higher-than-expected reports of heart inflammation following doses of the mRNA-based Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.


The new details about myocarditis and pericarditis emerged first in presentations to a panel of independent advisers for the Food and Drug Administration, who are meeting Thursday to discuss how the regulator should approach emergency use authorization for using COVID-19 vaccines in younger children.

                    <span>Ford Secures 100,000 Reservations For Electric F-150 As Pre-Order Count Climbs 

            
While Tesla&#x27;s Cybertruck remains in limbo somewhere and Lordstown Motors is on the brink of failure, Ford Motor Company&#x27;s F-150 Lightning pre-order count continues to surge. 


Three weeks ago, Ford unveiled the F-150 Lightning, an all-electric truck, delivering 563 horsepower and 775 lb.-ft. of torque. In the first 48 hours of release, the company received 44,500 pre-orders, according to CEO Jim Farley. 







Now, the pre-order count has reached 100,000 and continues to climb, according to Engadget. The F-Series line is America&#x27;s best-selling truck for more than four decades. Millions of loyal Ford customers would never buy a Chevy, nevertheless, a Tesa or some other startup with a limited track record. 


By comparison, since 2019, Tesla&#x27;s Cybertruck has accumulated over 1 million Cybertruck reservations. Ford has a much larger following than Tesla and could surpass reservations. 


Besides Ford&#x27;s loyal customer base, spanning generations, President Sleepy Joe gave the car company free press last month when he was seen driving around in the vehicle on a closed course. 





&quot;This sucker is quick,&quot; Biden said at the press conference. 


Reservations require a $100 refundable deposit. Ford has said the F-150 Lightning deliveries should begin in the spring of 2022. The Cybertruck is expected to be released in late 2022 but really, who knows. 


Those who made reservations for the Ford electric truck will only have to wait about 10-12 months until delivery. Meanwhile, those who made Cybertruck reservations have been waiting for a couple of years.

Authored by Pat Buchanan,


“Take away this pudding; it has no theme,” is a comment attributed to Winston Churchill, when a disappointing dessert was put in front of him.


Writers have used Churchill’s remark to describe a foreign policy that lacks coherence or centrality of purpose.


For most of our lifetimes, this has not been true of the United States. The goal of our foreign policy has been understandable and defined.


From 1949-1989, it was Cold War containment of the Soviet Empire and USSR.


Ronald Reagan believed in a “rollback” of communism, once telling an aide that his policy might be summed up as: “We win. They lose.”

A growing body of indicators point to Biden&#x27;s vaunted plan for a full Afghan troop exit by Sep.11 being anything but a true and full final &quot;exit&quot;. First, as we described earlier the Pentagon is thinking up ways to leave a significant security &quot;footprint&quot; which defense officials say is necessary to protect the sprawling embassy in Kabul. There&#x27;s also talk of &quot;counterterrorism support&quot; directed from outside the country, which is said to be one among a &quot;range of options&quot; to soon be presented to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


A South Korean designer has created a ‘third eye’ that allows people to constantly look at their cellphones in the street as a warning to “smartphone zombies.”







Paeng Min-wook’s ‘The Third Eye’ is basically a sophisticated robotic eyeball that users strap to their forehead which warns them if they are about to bump into something.


“Paeng’s invention uses a gyro sensor to measure the oblique angle of the user’s neck and an ultrasonic sensor to calculate the distance between the robotic eye and any obstacles. Both sensors are linked to an open-source single-board microcontroller, with battery pack,” reports Reuters.

The proposal is notably backed by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), and calls for $579 billion in net new spending &quot;beyond outlays that Congress was already expected to enact.&quot;

Much of the Western half of the US is in a severe drought, and parts of the Southwest are &quot;exceptionally dry,&quot; the worst category, according to US Drought Monitor. Taking this into account, the iconic Hoover Dam has just recorded the smallest amount of water inside Lake Mead since the 1930s. 







The damming of the Colorado River at the Nevada-Arizona border created Lake Mead and supplies water to 25 million people, including in the cities of Las Vegas, Phoenix, Tucson, Los Angeles, and San Diego.

Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,


The pace at which conditions are changing is catching a lot of people off guard.  Here in the United States, we have been in a low inflation environment for most of the past four decades, and so many Americans don’t even have a frame of reference for what a highly inflationary environment looks like.  But now we are facing an inflation crisis that is unlike anything that we have seen since the Jimmy Carter era in the 1970s.  In response to the COVID pandemic, governments around the world have been borrowing and spending colossal mountains of money, and global central banks have been absolutely flooding their respective financial systems with new cash…</span>

                    <span>&quot;A Dangerous Precedent&quot; - 3rd FDA Advisor Quits After Controversial Alzheimer&#x27;s Drug Approval

            
While the mainstream media focused on the hope-filled headlines that, for the first time since 2003, the FDA approved Biogen&#x27;s Aduhelm treatment for Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease; few, if any, were fully aware of the levels of controversy behind the scenes.







Aside from the scientific uncertainty over whether amyloid plaque treatments are an approach worth continuing...



Despite the dominance of the amyloid hypothesis over the past few decades, evidence that links reductions in plaque levels to improvements in cognition is “thin, at best”, says Jason Karlawish, a geriatrician and co-director of the Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


A research study published in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association describes “whiteness” as a parasitic pathology that has no cure.







Yes, really.


The article, which is entitled ‘On Having Whiteness’, was written by Dr. Donald Moss (who is white), a faculty member of both the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and the San Francisco Center for Psychoanalysis.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said former President Donald Trump would have won the 2020 election if investigations into the origin of COVID-19 and whether it escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, were not politicized.



“If COVID-19 had come about due to a Chinese lab leak, the top question on voters’ minds in the 2020 election would have become who was going to stand up to China. Which candidate would hold the Chinese accountable for unleashing the COVID-19 plague on the world?” wrote Graham for Fox News on Thursday.








As a result, Graham argued, “Americans would have demanded a tougher line against the Chinese c…</span>

Less than a week ago, we reported that the US COVID-19 vaccination scheme had fallen dramatically in recent weeks, likely a factor of a drop in new cases combined with an easing of facemask requirements.


And as President Biden scrambles to hit his July 4 target to vaccinate more than 70% of adults, a goal that&#x27;s looking increasingly remote every day, the NYT reported Thursday morning that there&#x27;s one region of the country that&#x27;s seeing vaccination demand fall more sharply than the others: And that&#x27;s the deep south. It shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise. But what&#x27;s even more surprising according to the NYT&#x27;s latest reporting, is that public health departments across the region have tried eve…</span>

                    <span>From Spank Bank To Food Bank: Toobin Post-Masturbation Redemption Tour Kicks Off

            
Journalist Jeffrey Toobin, who was suspended by CNN and fired from The New Yorker after he was caught masturbating on a zoom call last October in full view of colleagues, has been allowed back into the fold at the failing cable news network following a six-month period of &#x27;reflection and growth.&#x27;







Hilariously, he had to sit there as CNN host Alisyn Camerota rang the shame bell behind him - then explain his side of it.


&quot;...you were caught masturbating, on camera. You were subsequently fired from that job after 27 years of working [at the New Yorker], and you since then have been on leave from CNN,&quot; said Camerota, adding &quot;What the hell were you thinking?&quot;


Toobin acknowledged that he had been &quot;deeply moronic,&quot; and his actions were &quot;indefensible,&quot; adding that he&#x27;s spent the last seven &quot;miserable months&quot; trying to be a better person, &quot;in therapy, trying to do some public service, working at a food bank, working on a new book...&quot;


Good to know what it takes to compel Toobin to engage in charitable acts. We can only hope he washed his hands before dealing with people&#x27;s food.

                    <span>Half Of Pandemic Unemployment Funds May Have Been Stolen: Axios

            
As much as half of the unemployment benefits paid by the US government over the past year may have been stolen through fraud, with the bulk ultimately ending up outside the country - likely into the hands of foreign crime syndicates in China, Nigeria, Russia and elsewhere, according to Axios&#x27; Felix Salmon.


According to some estimates, unemployment fraud during the pandemic could &#x27;easily reach $400 billion,&#x27; as states weren&#x27;t prepared for the unprecedented wave of unemployment claims

States knew that fraud was inevitable, but opted to rush money out to people with minimal oversight, as opposed to laboriously vetting each application.

                    <span>Melvin Capital Among Hedge Funds Losing $6 Billion On Latest Meme Squeeze

            
&quot;Fool me once, shame on... shame on you. Fool me... you can&#x27;t get fooled again,&quot; were the infamous words of former President Bush and we suspect that Steve Cohen protégé Gabe Plotkin is reflecting on those stoic words as he looks back at his fund&#x27;s performance in May.


Plotkin&#x27;s Melvin Capital - infamously blown-up by a retail rampage during January&#x27;s WSB Raid on heavily-shorted stocks - was joined by another fund, Light Street Capital, run by Glen Kacher (a Tiger Cub) in suffering significant losses as the sense of deja vu all over again in markets sent the most-heavily-shorted &#x27;Meme stocks&#x27; soaring to even higher highs once again in May.







As The FT reports, hedge fund losses just from betting against five popular meme stocks - GameStop, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, AMC, BlackBerry and Clover Health - total about $6bn since the start of May, according to the data firm Ortex Analytics.


It appears the bailout of Melvin Capital (which after sustaining a $4.5bn loss in January got $2.75bn in new cash from Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Ken Griffin’s Citadel) was used to maintain his big shorts... and suffer a Sisyphean loss on his shorts once again.


Perhaps more notably, Peter Hillerberg, Ortex’s co-founder, said funds had recently reduced their short positions in meme stocks but that short interest remained “at very high levels”.


The FT reports that Melvin is now down 44.7% YTD (against the S&amp;P&#x27;s +12%) with $11 billion AUM; and Light Street is down 20.1% YTD with $3.3 billion AUM.


Both firms declined to comment...

Another quarter, another record high in (mostly 0.01%er) household net worth.


The Fed&#x27;s latest Flow of Funds report released at noon today showed the latest snapshot of the US &quot;household&quot; sector as of March 31 2021, which confirmed that one year after the biggest drop in household net worth on record when $8 trillion was wiped out in Q1, 2020, in the 1st quarter of 2021, the net worth of US households soared by $5 trillion, or 3.8%, to a record $136.9 trillion.

U.S. companies are holding on to billions of dollars in cash. Their banks aren’t sure what to do with it. Some banks are encouraging corporate customers to consider alternatives.

Drug kingpin Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman&#x27;s wife has pleaded guilty for her role in helping her husband run his multi-billion dollar empire in a Washington federal court on Thursday. 


32-year-old Emma Coronel Aispuro married El Chapo in 2007 and since then is believed to have &quot;aided and abetted&quot; the Sinaloa cartel in importing over 500,000 kilograms of drugs into the United States - mostly cocaine, but also heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana. For example the Mexico-based drug operation is believed responsible for up to 80% of all cocaine and heroin sold in Chicago in recent years.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Senator Rand Paul blasted Dr Fauci Wednesday, labelling him “an elitist” who believes Americans are not smart enough to make their own decisions about their health.







Appearing on Newsmax, Paul noted “I think it’s this — it’s one-size-fits-all and his idea that the regular people aren’t smart enough to make these regular decisions. So he just wants to treat everybody the same.”



“The one-size-fits-all strategy that everybody must get vaccinated ignores the science,” the Senator continued, adding “It’s mostly that he’s not telling the truth once again because he is an elitist, and he thinks we can’t handle the truth.”

June is typically the month the wildfire season in California begins. The state is already battling an extreme drought, and the first heat wave of the season hit last week. The risks of another heat wave are increasing for next week. 


The hottest and most fire-prone months are nearing as a second heat wave of the season could arrive as early as next week. 


How the season turns out may depend on the immediate climate in the state. Extreme heat and drought are several factors that may produce dry fuels and eventually spark fires. 


Forecast temperature anomalies daily are expected to jump for the southern part of the state by Tuesday/Wednesday and then the whole state by Friday. In many parts of the state, temperature anomalies, the difference from an average, or baseline, temperature, could be +14 degrees. Forecasts suggest Bakersfield and Fresno could reach triple digits. 







Prospects of the next heat wave come as the Drought Monitor (dated June 3) shows much of California, nevertheless, the West Coast, is experiencing some level of drought. 







California could be headed for a dangerous wildfire season with conditions already parched. 


Further, we want to monitor power prices in the state as grid demand could overwhelm supply, and power companies could issue rolling blackouts to conserve power or prevent wildfires.

Real Vision managing editor Ed Harrison welcomes Dave Floyd, founder of Aspen Trading, to break down the implications of today’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) print, which reached a 13-year high of 5.0% in yearly change. As concerns of inflation continue to apply pressure on the U.S. economy and markets, Floyd will be considering how this impacts bonds, equities, and currencies.

By Eric Kulisch of Freight Waves,


Ground service providers drowning in shipments delivered by airlines are responding to massive gridlock at Chicago O’Hare by permanently relocating some warehouse operations outside the property  to increase capacity in what could increasingly become a model at major U.S. airports that haven’t prioritized investment in cargo facilities.







Alliance Ground International (AGI), with stations around the country, and local ground handling agent Maestro International Cargo this month are both opening large, off-airport transfer facilities to enable faster pickup of import cargo, which currently can take up to six days to retrieve after an aircraft’s arrival.

                    <span>&quot;Pinching At The Supply&quot; - Delaware Restaurants Clawed By Crab Meat Shortage  

            
People on holiday are getting crabby in southern Deleware, right down the street from President Joe Biden&#x27;s vacation home, where a crab shortage has hit many popular restaurants. 


Crab processing plants on the Delmarva Peninsula to Gulf Coast states operate at a fraction of the output due to labor shortages. Crabs coming from Indonesia, the Philippines, and or India have seen shipment delays due to West Coast port congestion.

                    <span>How Will Investors Know If Inflation Is Transitory Or Permanent

            
By Steven Englander and John Davies, FX and Rates strategists at Standard Chartered Bank


The Fed has indicated that it does not see its expected inflation surge in the coming months as pointing to longer-term pressures. Many investors are sceptical, but do not have a framework from which to push back against the Fed’s optimism that it can manage a &quot;gentle inflation overshoot.&quot;


Here we argue that looking at trimmed mean inflation is a straightforward way of assessing whether an inflation surge is broad-based or narrow. So far, we find small indications that these broad-based inflation indicators are rising, but nothing conclusive. This assessment could change in the coming months.

With Wall Street firms tripping hand over foot to get out of New York, where taxes and crime are both on the rise, places like Palm Beach, Florida, are the beneficiaries. We have noted numerous firms, including names like Point 72 and Goldman Sachs, branching out and/or leaving New York altogether in favor of greener pastures in Florida, since the pandemic started.


Amidst the Wall Street exodus, Palm Beach office space demand is off the charges. The city has officially become a &quot;hot market&quot; for commercial real estate, according to a new report from BNN Bloomberg.

Dr. Fauci attempts to defend himself on MSNBC. And MSNBC is seemingly pleased to cooperate to spread even more Fauci lies.







I picked up this story from a Greenwald Tweet. 



Beyond the dangerous arrogance and pomposity of proclaiming &quot;anyone who criticizes me is attacking Science&quot; -- thus placing himself off-limits from questioning -- he *admitted* he purposely issued false, anti-science, politicized claims, such as telling people not to wear masks: https://t.co/TghpTiKHdj

In a recent blog post from DB&#x27;s Francis Yared, the credit strategist looks at one of the lesser discussed drivers of inflation and points out that supply shocks to oil prices have historically been relevant for inflation expectations.


As Yared writes, &quot;supply shock to oil prices have had a significant impact on inflation expectations on three occasions over the past half century: in the mid 70s, the mid 80s and the mid 10s.&quot; However, unlike the infamous price explosions of the 70s and 80s, in the latest episode the &quot;shale oil revolution&quot; resulted in a significant positive supply shock to oil markets which led OPEC in 2014 to defend its market share rather than oil prices.

In the latest show of US support for Taiwan, a group of US senators flew to the island on a military aircraft on Sunday, a trip that drew sharp condemnation from Beijing.


Senators Dan Sullivan (D-AK), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Chris Coons (D-DE) arrived in Taiwan aboard a C-17 Globemaster III cargo plane to announce the US was donating 750,000 Covid-19 vaccines to the island. According to Reuters, US officials typically visit Taiwan in unmarked private jets.

Authored by Kalev Leetaru via RealClearPolitics.com,


Who is receiving more attention on television news since the inauguration, President Joe Biden or former president Donald Trump?


The graph below shows the total mentions of President Biden across CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and BBC News London since Biden&#x27;s inauguration day. Fox News has mentioned him the most, though even BBC News London has mentioned him nearly a third as often as CNN and MSNBC.







In contrast, the graph below shows that Fox News has covered former president Donald Trump far less than CNN or MSNBC. Look closely and you will notice that CNN and MSNBC have actually mentioned Trump more than Biden.







The graph below compares the two presidents since Biden&#x27;s inauguration, comparing mentions of Biden (blue) against Trump (orange).







On MSNBC, former president Trump has received 129% of the coverage of President Biden, followed closely by CNN&#x27;s 118%. On BBC News London, Trump has received 83% of Biden&#x27;s mentions, while on Fox News Trump has received just 55% as much coverage as Biden.

The Group of Seven leaders, whose UK conclave will shortly be joined by Joe Biden, appears set to infuriate China, and in its draft communique seen by Bloomberg News, the world&#x27;s most developed nations not only call for a fresh, &quot;transparent&quot; (which suggests the previous study was anything but), WHO-convened study into the origins of the coronavirus (although since the China-controlled WHO, which is run by the &quot;prevaricating&quot; Tedros, is in charge it naturally won&#x27;t find anything new) but also pledge to tackle &quot;forced labor in global supply chains&quot;, including in the solar and garment sectors and involving state-sponsored forced labor of minorities.

                    <span>&quot;Paranoid Delusion&quot;: Beijing Urges Halt To US Sweeping $250BN Anti-China Tech Bill

            
After the US Senate on Tuesday passed a historic bill to commit some $250 billion to fund scientific research as well as subsidies for chipmakers and robot developers, including an overhaul of the National Science Foundation - the largest effort to date in efforts to boost a US competitive edge over China as a tech powerhouse - Beijing has reacted by mocking Washington&#x27;s &quot;paranoid delusion&quot; and &quot;Cold War mentality&quot;. It&#x27;s also calling for an &quot;immediate&quot; halt to the legislation&#x27;s progress as it goes to the House.


The bill, called the US Innovation and Competition Act passed the chamber 68-32 and had clear bi-partisan support, now ranking among the largest industrial bills in American histor…</span>

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


Several election workers in Fulton County, Georgia are scheduled to be deposed in the coming days in a lawsuit that alleges thousands of fraudulent ballots were scanned in Atlanta on Election Night in 2020.

Ruby Freeman, her daughter Wandrea Moss, Caryn Ficklin, and Keisha Dixon were served with notices to appear for depositions in the case, according to court records.

The Pentagon is touting that it&#x27;s already successfully withdrawn more than half of American forces from Afghanistan, which means it&#x27;s on a withdraw pace significantly ahead of Biden&#x27;s Sept. 11 exit deadline.


&quot;U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) estimates that we have completed greater than 50% of the entire retrograde process,&quot; the command announced Tuesday. And in terms of the massive logistical feat of removing military hardware after a two-decade occupation and build-up of bases, the military statement added that it&#x27;s removed the equivalent of approximately 500 C-17 planeloads of material while also removing 13,000 pieces of equipment.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


For over a year, there has been one fact that has been repeated in literally thousands of news stories: former Attorney General Bill Barr ordered the clearing of Lafayette Park on June 1, 2020 to allow former President Donald Trump to hold his controversial photo op in front of St. John’s Church. 


From the outset, there was ample reason to question the claim echoed across media outlets. As I noted in my testimony to Congress on the protest that month, the operation was clearly a response to days of violent and destructive protests. 


Now the Inspector General has completed its investigation and the report debunks the conspiracy theor…</span>

“On May 26, 2021, we received a request from the Staff of the SEC for the voluntary production of documents and information concerning a SEC investigation into the trading activity in our securities and the securities of other companies. We are in the process of reviewing the request and producing the requested documents and intend to cooperate fully with the SEC Staff regarding this matter. This inquiry is not expected to adversely impact us.”

A woman caught the attention of the mainstream press earlier this week after lavishly praising Vice President Kamala Harris and even claiming that she voted for the VP and President Joe Biden during a press conference.

Harris was taking questions at a press conference in Mexico City when her chief spokesperson Symone Sanders announced that the &quot;next question will come from Maria Fernanda at Univision,&quot; a well-known Spanish-language media company that&#x27;s popular in the US and Mexico.

                    <span>SEC&#x27;s Gensler Pushes For Executive Trading Plan Changes Aimed At Preventing Insider Trading

            
Company executives and insiders could be playing by a new set of 10b5-1 plan rules soon.


That&#x27;s because the Securities and Exchange Commission, headed up by Gary Gensler, has signaled that it plans on seeking to revise the rules that govern the stock trading plans, which are usually set up ahead of time to allow insiders to sell stock on a schedule. 


The plans have drawn scrutiny because there is no required disclosure when they are set up, despite many companies choosing to disclose the plans, and because they can be modified or canceled. They have also come under scrutiny after analysis from Stanford and U Penn found the plans were used for “opportunistic, large-scale selli…</span>

Authored by Rusty Weiss via ThePoliticalInsider.com,


The Daily Mail has revealed shocking text messages from Hunter Biden showing him using racial slurs and repeatedly using the n-word with his white lawyer in conversations.







The news comes just days after his father, President Joe Biden, gave an emotional speech on the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, in which he condemned racism.


Corporate attorney George Mesires, who is white, is allegedly referred to in the text messages multiple times as being black or referenced as a variation of the n-word.

President Biden previewed in a Washington Post op-ed that his eight day trip for which he embarked Wednesday, &quot;Will the democratic alliances and institutions that shaped so much of the last century prove their capacity against modern-day threats and adversaries? I believe the answer is yes. And this week in Europe, we have the chance to prove it.&quot;


And White House press secretary Jen Psaki Tuesday described somewhat dramatically how he&#x27;s been preparing for what&#x27;s the first foreign trip of his presidency: &quot;He&#x27;s been getting ready for 50 years.

We all knew this was coming. 







In order to justify the forced vaccination of children, the powers that be would somehow have to overturn 15 months of observations that COVID is less a threat to children than the flu and that unvaccinated children are less at risk than vaccinated adults (100 times less at risk than seniors), even if we are to believe Pfizer&#x27;s efficacy data.


&quot;CDC director reports spike in teen hospitalizations, urges parents to vaccinate kids over 12,&quot; was the headline at the Hill on Friday, reporting on the CDC&#x27;s new study of hospitalizations.


Naturally, it caught my attention because we a…</span>

Surely at this point, we have to be imagining things, right? 


We have reported twice on Tesla uber-bull and well known talking head-of-hair &quot;investment advisor&quot; Ross Gerber&#x27;s propensity for taking out government loans despite boasting on Twitter of how rich he was and how well his advisory firm was doing.


Back in July of 2020, we first pointed out that Gerber&#x27;s firm, Santa Monica-based Gerber Kawasaki, was among the many firms nationwide to take PPP money. His firm took out a total of $515,458 in PPP funds via Wells Fargo.







The irony, of course, came from the fact that on April 27, 2020, just 6 short days before his firm&#x27;s loan was approved, Gerber virtue signaled to the #resista…</span>

Update (1426ET): El Salvador has become the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender after Congress passed President Nayib Bukele&#x27;s proposal to embrace cryptocurrency. With bitcoin legal tender, just as the dollar, the country has set its sights on attracting miners. 


After all the clamoring about &quot;greening&quot; bitcoin mining, Bukele has offered miners &quot;cheap 100% clean, 100% renewable, 0 emissions&quot; energy. In fact, the president said the state-owned geothermal electric company LaGeo SA de CV will offer miners geothermal electricity powered from &quot;our volcanos.&quot;

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


We&#x27;re getting a real-world economics lesson in rip-your-face-off increases in prices, and the tuition is about to go up--way up.







Inflation will be transitory, blah-blah-blah--I beg to differ, for these reasons. There are numerous structural sources of inflation, which I define as prices rise while the quality and quantity of goods and services remain the same or diminish. Since the word inflation is so loaded, let&#x27;s use the more neutral (and more accurate) term decline in purchasing power: an hour of your labor buys fewer goods and services of lesser quality than it did a decade ago or a generation ago.

Leslie Wexner, former founder and CEO of L Brands and well known former pal of Jeffrey Epstein, has offloaded about $500 million worth of stock this year. In a filing posted Monday, Wexner revealed he sold $327 million in shares of L Brands, the parent company of Victoria&#x27;s Secret, bringing his total for the year up to about $500 million.


The sales come after Wexner revealed that he and his wife would be stepping down from the company&#x27;s board, according to Bloomberg.


The company&#x27;s stock is up about 600% since hitting a 5 year low in March 2020. Though Wexner had sold stock in the past to the tune of between $100 million and $200 million annually, his sales accele…</span>

Nearly 8 years have passed since Michael Lewis published &quot;Flash Boys&quot;, raising awareness of the relatively new practice of high-frequency trading and its transformative impact on markets, allowing the most technologically-advanced traders to effectively see a picture of the market that&#x27;s nanoseconds ahead of what their non-NFT peers see, giving them a massive advantage. 


Now, the SEC is finally considering changing the rules of how stocks are priced and traded to stop exchanges from incentivizing brokers (nowadays, particularly retail trading brokerages that have seen an explosion of activity in the past couple of years).

Beijing is poised to take an unprecedented step in its latest efforts to combat US and Western sanctions which have recently been ratcheted up particularly surrounding the Uyghur issue in Xinjiang. A draft law is now being examined by the National People&#x27;s Congress (NCP) which would shield Chinese entities and institutions from &quot;the unilateral and discriminatory measures imposed by foreign countries&quot; and ultimately the &quot;long arm jurisdiction&quot; of the United States, according to state media.

Authored by Maryellen Fullerton via SCOTUSblog.com,


The Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Monday that noncitizens who have been granted temporary humanitarian relief from deportation cannot use the process known as “adjustment of status” to obtain lawful permanent residency in the United States without leaving the country. 







The court ruled in Sanchez v. Mayorkas that adjustment of status is reserved for those who were inspected at the border and admitted to the United States by an immigration officer, thus disqualifying the majority of those granted Temporary Protected Status.


Justice Elena Kagan wrote the opinion for the court.

                    <span>Northeast Power Prices Jump As Heat Wave Forces Millions To Crank Up Air-Conditioning 

            
With the latest heat wave subsiding in the northeastern U.S., after several days of dangerously high temperatures above 90 degrees, power prices skyrocketed as tens of millions turned down their thermostats. 


According to Bloomberg, electricity prices in New England tripled on Monday from a year ago. Since the weekend, a heat wave blanketed the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast but will subside by midweek. 


Gary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy, said energy demands are way &quot;above normal&quot; for this time of year because of increasing air-conditioning use. New England&#x27;s grid operator could reach its summer peak in June instead of August, typically the hottest part of summer.


Monday&#x27;s highs were 90-95 degrees in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area to New York City to Boston. 


Grid operator PJM Interconnection LLC, a regional transmission organization serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, issued a hot weather alert Monday. PJM requested owners of transmission lines and power plants to delay maintenance. 


On-peak electricity prices for Bloomingdale, Massachusetts, energy prices per megawatt-hour spiked on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. 







Peak energy prices for New York City also spiked. 







The heat wave is expected to dissipate by mid-week as Mid-Atlantic and Northeast temperatures will be around average or slightly below normal as a cold front rolls in through the weekend.

By Jeffrey Jones of Gallup


Seventy-six percent of U.S. adults say they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or plan to be, a number that has been stable over the past three months but is higher than in late 2020 and early 2021.







As of the May 18-23 survey, 60% of U.S. adults report they have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 4% have been partially vaccinated, 12% plan to be vaccinated and 24% do not plan to be vaccinated.


Among those not planning to be vaccinated, 78% say they are unlikely to reconsider their plans, including 51% who say they are &quot;not likely at all&quot; to change their mind and get vaccinated. That leaves one in five vaccine-reluctant adults open to recons…</span>

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


We recently discussed the case of Loudoun County teacher Byron “Tanner” Cross who was suspended for speaking against gender policies. In a major victory for the free speech rights of teachers, Twelfth Circuit Judge James E. Plowman ordered LCPS to restore Cross’ position as a physical education teacher at Leesburg Elementary School. In a letter, the court found a basis for a temporary injunction to allow Cross to return until Dec. 31 pending further orders of the court.







Cross ran into trouble when he appeared at a meeting of the school board.

In a continuing trend in Latin American politics of Left-wing political movements on the ascendancy which has seen successful attempts to roll back free market friendly policies in favor of &quot;starting from scratch&quot; toward erecting more interventionist socialist states, the next political and electoral earthquake is set to hit Peru, where socialist candidate Pedro Castillo is maintaining a narrow lead over right-wing rival Keiko Fujimori as votes are still being counted and increasingly contested from Sunday&#x27;s run-off election.

                    <span>&quot;Nothing Changed&quot; - Manchin Refuses To Back Down On Election Reform Vote After Meeting With Civil Rights Group

            
Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has signaled opposition to several Democrat-proposed voting bills and ending the filibuster, said he won’t budge on a sweeping bill to overhaul federal elections after he met with civil rights groups.


“There was nothing basically for or against … basically everyone’s position was discussed,” Manchin told reporters on Tuesday after meeting with NAACP President Derrick Johnson, Al Sharpton, National Urban League president Marc Morial, and others.


When asked about whether he would support the “For the People Act” bill, the Democrat senator said, “No, I don’t think anybody change…</span>

An extremely rare, uncirculated 1933 Double Eagle gold coin sold for a record $19.51 million at Sotbeby&#x27;s auction in New York on Tuesday.

Sotheby&#x27;s described the $20 coin designed by American sculptor Agustus Saint Gaudens as the last US gold coin ever made and intended for circulation, making it &quot;one of the most coveted coins in the world.&quot; The $19.51 million sale price blew past pre-sale estimates of between $10 and $15 million, breaking the record for the most expensive coin in the world which was previously set by a 1974 Flowing Hair silver dollar that went for $10 million in 2013, according to AFP.

                    <span>The Colonial Pipeline Hack, The &#x27;Russians&#x27;, &amp; The FBI&#x27;s Ransom-Grab - What Really Happened?

            
Speculation has been running rampant over today&#x27;s FBI press conference revealing the recovery of most of the ransom paid to &quot;Russian&quot; hackers by Colonial Pipeline.


Ben THE Kaufman summarizes:



Media: &quot;The FBI hacked Bitcoin and can take anyone&#x27;s funds.&quot;


Reality: The pipeline hackers didn&#x27;t have the Bitcoin in the first place but kept it in a remote server the FBI could access with subpoena.


Media coverage is mostly lies at this point.



Which raises the following point (h/t Jordan Schachtel):



So the &quot;hackers&quot; brought down the largest pipeline on the east coast...


...but couldn&#x27;t spend 50 bucks on a clean hardware wallet to secure their bitcoin?

Things aren&#x27;t going so well for Vice President Kamala Harris during her Guatemala trip, where as we observed earlier she went full Trump mode in a speech before Guatemalan press: &quot;...I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States Mexico border: Do not come, do not come,&quot; she said.


Simultaneously NBC News published a sit-down interview between Harris and news anchor Lester Holt which took place during the trip. He pressed her on why she hadn&#x27;t visited the border and that&#x27;s where things quickly got testy...

Talks between President Joe Biden and Sen. Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV) - lead GOP negotiator on infrastructure legislation - have ended with no resolution, according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Josh Wingrove. The negotiations, held via teleconference between the White House and a small group of Republican senators, were weighed down by deep disagreements over what actually constitutes &#x27;infrastructure,&#x27; with Republicans using the dictionary definition of roads and other public works, and Democrats expanding it to include just about anything they want it to mean.

The story about Wuhan’s “wet market” is taking on water. 







We’ve moved well past the “trust but verify” stage. We’re now in the “don’t trust a damn thing they say” stage.


In this case, “they” refers mostly to the Chinese Communist Party.


But the public’s mistrust has spread to our own government’s public health experts, and to much of the Western media, as well.


We still don’t know where the COVID-19 pandemic originated, but the more we learn, the less China’s official story sounds right. The World Health Organization’s year-long endorsement of Beijing means nothing. At this point, even the WHO is starting to say we need a more thorough inves…</span>

Oil prices spiked today with WTI back above $70 for the first time since Oct 2018 as traders edged down their odds of a completed Iran nuclear deal (which would likely bring new supply). US told Iran on Tuesday that it must let the UN atomic agency continue to monitor its activities, as laid out in an agreement that has been extended until June 24, or put wider talks on reviving the Iran nuclear deal at risk...

It&#x27;s that time of the month when Bond King Jeff Gundlach regales his subjects, and investors in his DoubleLine, with his latest monthly thoughts revealed in the periodic webcast for this Total Return Fund.


Since it&#x27;s been about three months since Gundlach&#x27;s March 9 webcast when he laid out his outlook for the year, here is a recap of what he said then courtesy of Bloomberg:



Gundlach reiterated his bearish dollar call in the short-term, saying the greenback will be correlated to the budget. The Bloomberg Dollar Index has since declined 2.4% since he said that.

	
He called the Nasdaq “dicey,” making a daring call that it could eventually drop as much as it did from 2000 to 2003 (after the dot-com bubble deflated.) H…</span>

Just as Ontario finally lifted some of its COVID-19-inspired travel restrictions, the US Department of State announced plans to revise its travel advisory for dozens of countries, including its neighbors, Canada and Mexico. While the border between American and Canada may remain closed until September, the State Department&#x27;s decision to lower its travel advisory to a Level 3 from a Level 4 could have major implications for tourism around the world.


Back in April, the US rated about 150 countries out of 209 as &quot;Level 4: Do Not Travel.&quot; Today that number has fallen to about 125 at the highest advisory level.

According to the report, &quot;an explosion&quot; occurred at a polysilicon plant in Shihezi City, Xinjiang, China. Polysilicon, or poly-Si, is used as a raw material by the solar photovoltaic and electronics industries.

This report is so far unconfirmed by major western media outlets and is developing... But if confirmed, this could have severe implications for the global semiconductor industry, which is already in a terrible shortage.

Ronald Reagan (1978): “Inflation is as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man.”


Joe Biden (2021): “A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything will be okay. Too many people today can’t do that – and it’s got to change.”

Iran nuclear talks in Vienna continue dragging on and despite recent weeks of positive developments and optimistic statements of being on the cusp of a restored deal, things are more tense than ever heading into a sixth round of talks set to begin on Thursday.


This is after a briefing issued by the UN&#x27;s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) early this week which alleged Iran is failing to cooperate with the nuclear watchdog after it found nuclear particles at multiple undeclared sites, possibly suggesting a more expanded program than previously believed.

Authored by Nick Corbishley via NakedCapitalism.com,


After India finally gets somewhat of a grip on its deadly second wave, one of its health regulators just took away one of its main lines of defense. 







India’s Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) has executed a policy reversal that could have massive implications for the battle against covid-19, not only in India but around the world. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives, are at providing stake. Providing no explanation whatsoever, the DGHS has overhauled its COVID-19 treatment guidelines and removed almost all of the repurposed medicines it had previously recommended for treating asymptomatic and mild…</span>

In case we needed more proof that the US labor market is in a historic supply-demand mismatch crisis sparked by Biden&#x27;s generous unemployment benefits, a few hours after the latest NFIB showed that it has never been more difficult for small business to fill job openings, moments ago the BLS confirmed what we expected: that the number of job openings in March (recall JOLTS is one month delayed) soared by a record 998K to 9.286MM in April from an upward revised 8.288MM in march, and the highest in the history of US jobs data!







The record number was also a record beat to the already lofty expectations of a 8.2 million print.

Throughout 2020, investors left the commodity sector discarded at the trash heap of the market, focusing instead entirely on growth and deflation names. Fast forward to today and boy have things changed: not only have growth names done little to nothing in 2021, a year which has seen near record shorting of tech names and a constant outflow of equity funds...







... but as sentiment shifts toward &quot;value&quot;, commodity-linked stocks have been rising every day, and even such boring names as Exxon and Chevron have recently turned into hedge fund darlings, attracting a bevy of activist shareholders and pushing higher by the day.

Authored by Bruce Wilds via Advancing Time blog,


Damn near every economist and analyst seem oblivious to the point being made in this article. The Fed should be ecstatic so many people are willing to invest in intangible assets. By not buying  tangible and real items they help to minimize inflation. In our bullshit world where media outlets like Bloomberg tout the message if you are not in this rising market, you are missing out, it is understandable that people want in. With this in mind, it is no wonder the investment world has become a minefield that is often compared to a casino.

Real Vision senior editor Ash Bennington welcomes Thomas Thornton to discuss the inflation debate ahead of the US CPI number to be released Thursday and the bullish sentiment present in markets. The pair examines the effect of Bitcoin’s illegal use and confiscation on the downturn that the asset has recently experienced. In addition, they look to make sense of meme stock mania as Wendy’s and Clover Health stocks explode higher.

                    <span>Supreme Court Asked To Halt CDC Eviction Moratorium

            
Authored by Matthew Vadum via The Epoch Times,


Alabama and Georgia real estate agents have asked the Supreme Court to block a federal moratorium on evictions that was imposed last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid the pandemic.







Congress enacted a nationwide moratorium on evictions and extended its life through Jan. 31, 2021. The Atlanta-based CDC, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, then imposed its own moratorium at the behest of then-President Donald Trump, the current iteration of which is set to run out on June 30. The theory was that uprooting tenants would spread the virus, which now appears to be in decline. Violators could face criminal p…</span>

It was supposed to be the biggest threat to the reserve status of the dollar (China&#x27;s denial that it has no desire to replace the USD with the digital yuan only confirms it) since the failed experiment that is the &quot;whatever it takes&quot; euro, but instead it is turning out to be one giant yawn.


While many pundits have argued that China&#x27;s digital yuan would be a &quot;potentially fatal challenge&quot; to American hegemony according to historian Niall Ferguson, Templeton&#x27;s Hasenstab saying it could undermine the dollar&#x27;s role as a reserve currency and even Biden&#x27;s White House studying the potential threats to the US currency, one month ago we reported that those who’ve actually used the digital yuan in China offer a va…</span>

                    <span>The Mysterious $85 Billion Surge In China&#x27;s FX Reverse Repo

            
By Ye Xie, Bloomberg reporter and Markets Live commentator


A mysterious surge in dollar lending by Chinese banks in an arcane corner of the financial market is leading some investors to wonder whether it’s somehow related to the “stealth intervention” by the PBOC to slow yuan appreciation.


For years, Chinese banks had little use for foreign-currency reverse repo, which is effectively collateralized lending. That has dramatically changed since the pandemic. Banks’ FX reverse repos surged to a record $87 billion in April, from less than $2 billion a year earlier.


“Historically, Chinese banks FX assets and liabilities have consisted almost exclusively of loans and deposits,” Alex Etra, a senior strategist …</span>

Secretary of State Antony Blinken in an appearance on &quot;Axios on HBO&quot; previewed what he expects to come out of the Putin-Biden summit set for June 16 in Geneva. The short answer is: not much except for vague warnings and threats, it appears. Blinken said during the interview that the US president intends to warn Putin &quot;directly and clearly what he can expect from the United States if aggressive, reckless actions toward us continue.&quot;


While explaining that Washington would prefer a &quot;more stable&quot; relationship with Russia, Blinken also sought to distance the White House from growing criticism that Biden is getting &#x27;weak&#x27; on promises to &quot;stand up&quot; to Putin, particularly after recently dropping sa…</span>

                    <span>The Currency Story Has Undergone A Silent, Subtle Curve Shift

            
By Ven Ram, Bloomberg reporter and macro commentator


Front-end yields held hostage by central banks around the world have engendered a silent shift in currency pricing: exchange movements are being increasingly influenced by changes in the intermediate and longer segments of the yield curve.


Currencies that were typically more responsive to relative changes in yields at, say, the two-year part of the curve are now responding more and more to shifts at the five- and 10-year segments, with the dollar being a case in point.







The chart above shows how closely the Dollar Index has tracked five-year real yield spreads between the U.S. and Germany (hat tip to J. Paul Knight, assistant portfolio manager of U.S. large-cap equity at the Employees Retirement System of Texas for his observation). Indeed, the correlation between the spreads and the dollar in the past year is running at 0.57, reflecting its influence on the currency. Taken together with 10-year differentials , the two points of the curve delineate the trajectory of the dollar by more than four-fifths.







To be sure, it wasn’t always like this. Take a look at this chart above that encompasses a longer time frame, which shows the Dollar Index ignoring the movement in spreads. That was a time clearly before the pandemic when the U.S. economy was still in the midst of its longest post-war expansion, with central banks not anywhere near controlling the yield curve, de facto or de jure.

                    <span>MTA Inspector General &quot;Furious&quot; After Probe Finds Seven Track Inspectors &quot;Skipped&quot; And &quot;Falsified&quot; Inspection Reports

            
It looks like much to the surprise of no one, there&#x27;s considerable waste and malfeasance taking place at the perpetually-taxpayer-bailed-out MTA.


A new MTA inspector general&#x27;s report has revealed that MTA track engineers - to quote Rep. Al Green talking about Citadel earlier this year - &quot;have been naughty for some time&quot;.


The inspector general is reportedly &quot;furious&quot; after the findings of an 11 month investigation found that seven NYC Transit track inspectors were skipping inspections and falsifying inspection reports. The employees in question have been suspended, according to an RT&amp;S report.


But rather than fire all seven employees - in true tax…</span>

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


Malaysian police are using drones which can check temperatures from as high as 20 meters above ground in the latest example of coronavirus population control.







The drones alert authorities if someone has a high temperature reading by emitting a red light, according to Bernama, Malaysia’s state news agency.


“Malaysian police have previously warned they will use drones to enforce earlier travel restrictions, with officers in some areas also stating they would carry out surprise home visits to ensure people were following rules,” reports the Guardian.

Tokyo Police are investigating an apparent suicide on Monday morning (local time) of a senior official at the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC) who jumped in front of a subway train. 


Nippon TV&#x27;s News24 channel reports Yasushi Moriya, who led JOC&#x27;s accounting department, apparently ended his own life in the Tokyo Metro system. Police have yet to release details surrounding the death of the official.

                    <span>Imagine Being A Central Banker In June 2021

            
By Larry McDonald, author of the Bear Traps Report


Imagine sitting in the seat of a central banker in June of 2021. You are looking down the barrel of millions of AMC nutjobs making up 9% of all U.S. equity market option volume on Friday and 8.2 million jobless Americans.


Since Jackson Hole (August 2020) you have been lecturing most of the planet ́s inhabitants that ridding the world of inequality is closest to your heart. Above all your message has been, “we did it all wrong in previous hiking cycles in pulling back accommodation too soon, this time we are going to let it run hot and lift all Americans up into the heavens.”

A New York parent brought the heat to members of the Carmel Central School District board for &#x27;emotionally abusing&#x27; children by &#x27;indoctrinating them with communist values.&#x27;







In comments at a school board business meeting in Putnam County, NY on Thursday, parent Tatiyana Ibrahim - whose child is a student, slammed the educators for promoting Critical Race Theory (CRT), Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ and anti-police ideologies both on and off campus.


&quot;Stop indoctrinating our children. Stop teaching our children to hate the police. Stop teaching our children that if they don’t agree with the LGBT community that they’re homophobic. You have no idea each child’s life,&quot; she said, adding &quot;You don’t know what their family lifestyle consists of, you don’t know the makeup of their life.&quot;


Watch:





Ibrahim shut down school board members&#x27; objections several times - in between calling out two teachers for posting their political beliefs online. When board members told her she wasn&#x27;t allowed to reference people by name, Ibrahim claimed those teachers called &quot;for the death of a former president,&quot; and that students who don&#x27;t support Black Lives Matter should be &quot;canceled out.&quot;


&quot;Why are we not allowed to say names? Why am I not allowed when they purposefully expose themselves on social media, talking about calling for the death of a former president, or saying that any child who doesn’t believe in Black Lives Matter should be canceled out. Is this what my tax dollars are paying for?&quot; she asked.


&quot;You’re emotionally abusing our children and mentally abusing them,&quot; Ibrahim continued. &quot;You’re demoralizing them by teaching them communist values, this is still America, ma’am.&quot;

By Tom Ozimek of The Epoch Times


Texas has joined a coalition of what is now 25 states urging the U.S. Supreme Court to repeal a New Jersey law banning the possession of firearms with magazines that hold more than 10 bullets, arguing the prohibition violates the Second Amendment and puts law-abiding citizens less able to defend themselves against dangerous criminals.


Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced in a statement that he had signed onto an amicus brief (pdf) which argues that allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms with 11-plus capacity magazines benefits public safety, counterbalances the threat of illegal gun violence, and helps “make our streets safer.”…</span>

Update (1725ET): After leaking lower all day, following &quot;scam&quot; comments from former president Trump and the DoJ press conference on ransomware, cryptos just puked hard after the cash equity close with no obvious headline or technical level as a catalysts.


Bitcoin tumbled over $2000 in minutes to around $33500...







And Ethereum plunged below $2600..







Interestingly, ETH is still outperforming BTC in this downturn, back near recent relative highs...







Some are suggesting that this is the DoJ dumping the crypto they have recovered from recent ransomware attacks in an effort to &#x27;teach&#x27; the crypto crooks a lesson.

Back in October, before &quot;meme stocks&quot; had become &quot;a thing&quot; and a share of GME could be purchased for less than $15, we noted that former porn star Lana Rhoades had apparently stumbled on to a new, potentially more lucrative, line of work: pitching &#x27;trading seminars&#x27; and other products (up to and including s***coins).


Since then, Rhoades has really made a go of it, pitching coins like &quot;cumrocket&quot; and &quot;titcoin&quot;. Over the weekend, however, she apparently touched a nerve by posing with a copy of Benjamin Graham&#x27;s seminal finance book &quot;the Intelligent Investor&quot; in a pitch for &quot;pawgcoin&quot;, yet another shitcoin focused on the adult entertainment industry.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Below is my column in the Hill on the future of the filibuster and why this may be the most credible period for the use of such a compromise-forcing rule. There have always been good-faith arguments against the use of such a rule as inhibiting democratic voting. After all, the rule blocks bare majority voting. However, with a razor-thin margin in both houses, the use of such a rule can help force greater dialogue and compromise in Congress, which most voters indicate that they want in polls. It now appears that Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.V.) will block the federal voting rights legislation even without a filibuster. As a result he was attacked …</span>

                    <span>Amazon Will Be Covered If International Tax Deal Ever Becomes Law

            
Amazon shares tumbled to their lowest levels of the session on Monday amid reports that Amazon would be included in a G-7 deal cemented over the weekend to retool the minimum corporate tax in some of the world&#x27;s wealthiest nations (though a US-led movement to force the proposal down the throats of reluctant Ireland, Singapore and other low-tax nations remains very much in doubt).







As we learned over the weekend via a communique from G-7 ministers, a pillar of the deal envisaged that the tax would apply on &quot;profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises.&quot; Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s low-margin e-commerce business, the firm doesn&#x27;t technically meet that cutoff, as t…</span>

People caught on that the returns on the frenzied hamster wheel of &quot;normal&quot; have been diminishing for decades, but everyone was too busy to notice.


The superficial &quot;return to normal&quot; narrative focuses solely on first order effects: now that people can dispense with masks and social distancing, they are resuming their pre-pandemic spending orgy with a vengeance, which augurs great profits for Corporate America and higher tax revenues. Yea for &quot;return to normal.&quot;


This superficial narrative ignores second-order effects of the pandemic. Recall that first order effects: every action has a consequence. Second order effects: every consequence has its own consequence. We ca…</span>

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called for Dr. Anthony Fauci to resign from his position as head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) following the publication of a trove of hundreds of emails.







McCarthy, speaking to Breitbart News over the past weekend, said that the American public has lost trust in Fauci after emails released last week raised questions about how Fauci handled the COVID-19 pandemic and his messaging to media outlets. Fauci has defended his emails and said they are being taken out of context.

                    <span>Consumer Credit Hits New Record Despite Unexpected Decline In Credit Card Usage

            
After several months of blowout consumer credit prints, including two consecutive months in which revolving (i.e., credit card) debt, rose after shrinking 10 of the previous 11 months, America&#x27;s credit-funded spending spree abruptly slowed in April, when total consumer credit rose by $18.6BN, down from $25.8BN in March (since revised conveniently to $18.6BN), and missing expectations of $20.5BN. Overall, total consumer credit rose at a 5.3% annual rate in April to a new all time high of $4.238 trillion.

The Department of Justice announced on Monday that they&#x27;ve recovered some $4.4 million dollars worth of Bitcoin paid in ransom to hackers who prompted the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline, according to CNN, which notes that &quot;The ransom recovery is a rare outcome for a company that has fallen victim to a debilitating cyberattack in the booming criminal business of ransomware.&quot;



Colonial Pipeline Co. CEO Joseph Blount told The Wall Street Journal In an interview published last month that the company complied with the $4.4 million ransom demand because officials didn&#x27;t know the extent of the intrusion by hackers and how long it would take to restore operations.

                    <span>Trump Planned To Haul Fauci, Daszak In Front Of US Presidential Commission, Demand China Reparations

            
Former President Donald Trump planned to haul Anthony Fauci in front of a US presidential commission as part of a larger effort to hold China and its collaborators responsible for the pandemic, according to The Australian.







Trump&#x27;s team, spearheaded by adviser Peter Navarro, had gone so far as to draft an executive order and compile a reparations bill, however the advanced plans were scrapped at the last minute after Trump&#x27;s ever-helpful advisers (Larry Kudlow in particular) talked him out of it, according to an upcoming book on the origins of COVID-19, What Really Happened in Wuhan.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Senator Rand Paul told Sean Hannity Friday that he is receiving death threats almost every day for daring to question the authority of Dr Anthony Fauci, as well as highlighting evidence that the coronavirus could have leaked from a Wuhan lab.







“This week, I’ve had five death threats just for being outspoken on it,” Paul said, adding “I don’t know what the world’s coming to, you can’t ask honest, difficult questions that in the end have proved out that Dr. Fauci was not being honest with us.”


Paul continued “As a repercussion, my family had white powder sent to our house, and five death threats phoned in.”

It still looks like we are nowhere near the end of the ongoing global semi chip shortage. Even worse, more manufacturers are confirming that the shortage could last &quot;for at least another year&quot;, catalyzed by sharp post-pandemic demand for automobiles and electronics. 


Flex, the world’s third-biggest electronics contract manufacturer, offered up the &quot;gloomiest&quot; forecast for the crisis yet to FT this week. The company has more than 100 sites in 30 countries and works with major names like Dyson and HP.

Following up on The Trap which suggested recent market strength may turn into a bull trap.







Last week again we saw the tiniest dip in markets instantly reverted and markets again closed at the weekly highs on Friday, near all time highs as a matter of fact. Indeed, the historical backtest scenarios outlined in The Trap permit for marginal new highs. And in keeping with observing the set up develop we can note that during this renewed run higher last week we saw something we haven’t seen since the last major top.


Transports diverged in a fairly pronounced fashion and we’re seeing this divergence again this morning:

&quot;I want to emphasize that the goal of our work is to help Guatemalans find hope at home. At the same time I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States Mexico border: Do not come, do not come,&quot; she said.

Following conflicts over trade, technology, and capital markets, the US and China are locked in a great power competition, as some describe it as Thucydides Trap. We believe the battleground for global supremacy is heating up on the hypersonic front. 


According to South China Morning Post (SCMP), researcher Han Guilai, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said a new wind tunnel in Beijing will &quot;soon be unveiled&quot; and put China decades ahead of the West in hypersonic technology. 


Guilai told an online lecture in late May that the JF-22 wind tunnel, in Beijing&#x27;s Huairou district, was capable of simulating flights at 30 times the speed of sound. He said this would put China &quot;about 20 to 30 years a…</span>

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


A top senator in Pennsylvania said Saturday that he supports an audit of the 2020 presidential election.



“I support the call for an election audit, in order to answer any lingering questions that still remain about the fairness of the 2020 elections in Pennsylvania. This is the best path forward to address the legitimate concerns of the large majority of my constituents who voted to reelect President [Donald] Trump, as well as all Pennsylvanians,” state Sen. David Argall, a Republican who chairs the Pennsylvania Senate’s State Government Committee, told The Epoch Times in an emailed statement.

Last week, when Biden released his $6 trillion budget, we asked if it was a joke that the BIden budget saw just 2.1% inflation in 2021 and 2022.

Fast forward to this weekend, when Fed Chair Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen addressed our rhetorical concern, and following the G7 finmin meeting in London where the world&#x27;s most advanced nations agreed to impose a 15% minimum corporate tax rate (with zero enforcement provisions), said that contrary to the Biden Budget, inflation could climb as high as 3% this year in what the WaPo said was &quot;the first time the Biden administration projected …</span>

As small businesses complain that it has never been harder for them to hire workers according to a recent NFIB survey, many are facing growing pressure to survive. As the American economy continues to reopen, some fear it might not happen soon enough to save thousands of small businesses. Data from Alignable&#x27;s June Revenue Poll shows that 35% of all small business owners are still at risk of closing permanently by the end of the summer.


Among the 3,772 small business owners in the 10 days ended June 1, Alignable&#x27;s June Revenue Poll showed a myriad of factors - including the remaining closures and restrictions, growing inflationary pressures on prices, rising gas and transportation prices and la…</span>

Picking up on a joke we made earlier this week when we called Joe Biden the Six Trillion Dollar Man (in homage to a very deflationary Lee Majors) in response to the 12 zeroes contained in his budget, in his latest Weekly Kickstart note Goldman&#x27;s David Kostin writes that...



by at least one measure, inflation has been rampant during the past 50 years, noting that in 1973, Steve Austin was the most powerful man in the world, with super strength in his right arm, a bionic eye, and artificial legs that could run 60 mph. It cost the federal government $6 million to re-build the NASA astronaut into the bionic man, played by Lee Majors in the hit TV series, “The Six Million Dollar Man…</span>

Surging construction costs to build a new home is not sustainable and is becoming a pain in the arse for homebuilders and prospective homebuyers. From concrete to lumber to copper pipes to paint and even appliances, costs have surged over the past year.

The housing boom sparked by the Federal Reserve during the virus pandemic was built on historically low mortgage rates (thanks to Powell) and accelerated by a combination of record-low inventory as city-dwellers moved to rural areas amid the remote-work phenomenon.

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


The Georgia Republican Party on Saturday approved a resolution censuring Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, local media reported.


The Georgia GOP during a convention approved a resolution that says Raffensperger, a Republican, failed to perform his duties in “accordance with the laws of the Constitution of the State of Georgia,” WSB-TV reported.







The document says the failure stemmed from Raffensperger entering into a settlement agreement with the Democratic Party of Georgia, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.


The agreement saw Raffensperger agree to promote …</span>

In the latest surreal and brazen example of federal government overreach, the FBI is demanding that USA Today turn over the IP addresses of all individuals who accessed a public online article during a specific time period. 


The subpoena was issued in April but is only in recent days being made public after the newspaper&#x27;s parent company Gannett sought to fight it in court. It&#x27;s being widely condemned as an outrageous instance of abuse not only of press freedom, but of the public&#x27;s right to access information and media as well as breach of both the 1st and 4th Amendments.

The number of COVID-19 deaths in Alameda County, California, fell by about 25 percent after health officials changed their methodology for total mortality count, removing those that were not a “direct result” of the disease, or “in whom death caused by COVID-19 could not be ruled out.”

Authored by Jason Ditz via AntiWar.com,


Political rancor and tensions surround the 2020 election had many US companies trying to distance themselves from the process by halting political donations. This included one of the biggest sectors for buying influence, the arms industry.


After a few months to reexamine things, the arms companies are back to throwing money around, donating in large quantities to members of both parties involved in military spending, and trying to ensure that they stay on good terms with everyone responsible for their business’ contracts.

                    <span>NASA&#x27;s Mars Helicopter Prepares For 7th Flight On Sunday

            
Liftoff of NASA&#x27;s Mars helicopter Ingenuity will occur no later than today if all goes to plan, according to a NASA press release. 


Ingenuity, a small robotic helicopter weighing no more than 4 pounds, is preparing for its seventh flight today. The mission is to fly Ingenuity 350 feet south from its current location on the floor of Jezero Crater. 



&quot;This will mark the second time the helicopter will land at an airfield that it did not survey from the air during a previous flight,&quot; NASA wrote. &quot;Instead, the Ingenuity team is relying on imagery collected by the HiRISE camera aboard NASA&#x27;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that suggests this new base of operations is relatively flat and has few surface obstructions.&quot;



On May 22, Ingenuity flew its sixth mission that did not go so well. The solar-powered helicopter experienced glitches that interrupted internal systems. There was no mention of what caused the glitches; the craft was able to land safely. 







Ingenuity has marvelously performed five flights and beamed incredible images from Mars back to Earth. 


NASA also has the Perseverance rover conducting land-based missions in the search for life. 


In the last couple of months, the Red Planet has become a hotspot for the US and China, with China landing a rover of its own on the planet.


Sudden interest in Mars between both countries is because the planet allegedly has an abundance of rare metals that will power tomorrow&#x27;s economy.

In a surprise aggressive move, American and British troops are landing on the beaches in Normandy today. 







Germany’s Transocean News Service reports that Germans vacationing in the sleepy hamlets of this coastal region were awakened by the ships, planes, guns, and bombs of this sneak attack. A few brave German tourists quickly ran to bunkers and began returning fire to protect their French brothers and sisters.


Germany has already been subject to a horrifying 363 air raids by the Allied air forces in an attempt to terrorize its citizens. British bombers have already dropped over 45,000 tons of bombs while American aircraft dropped 23,000 tons. Nearly 1.7 mill…</span>

                    <span>The Importance Of Equity Duration

            
By Variant Perception


We have seen much commentary that if US 10y yields go back to 2.5% or 3.0%, then equity markets suffer.  We prefer a different way to looking at the problem.  The key is what inflation is doing alongside any move in nominal yields. The below chart shows the % of the US yield curve trading below inflation. We highlight in green the periods when more than 50% of the yield curve is trading below inflation (as is the case today).


Source: Bloomberg, Macrobond and Variant Perception


Typically, negative real yields are very stimulative for equities.  It is only when most of the yield curve is trading above inflation (white bars in right chart above) that equity markets start to face persistent headwinds.


Equity investors do need to worry about rising yields in terms of sector rotation.  Duration is a basic concept for fixed income investors, but for equity investors, it is a less common method to look at portfolio exposures.


We have built a duration calculator for equities, using a combination of a 15-year DCF (consensus earnings forecasts, 2% terminal growth rate, individual cost of equity) and a terminal value duration component. This allows us to see which equities are most sensitive to a move in yields.


For the stocks in the Russell 1000, we calculate the duration of each name and aggregate to find the duration for different sectors. Financials, energy and consumer staples look like relative safe-havens. Info tech, healthcare and consumer discretionaries have the highest durations and are more vulnerable to yield moves.

Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),


California, with its relatively large tax burden compared to other states, has seen a taxpayer exodus in recent years and, along with it, billions in taxable gross income.


State-to-state migration data recently released by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shows that California lost an estimated net 70,534 households—or 165,355 taxpayers and their dependents—in the years 2017-2018, with those fleeing taking around $8.8 billion in net adjusted gross income with them.

In a pre-recorded video, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele made a somewhat shocking announcement in the final hours of the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami on Saturday afternoon.







Bukele said Saturday he will send a bill to the Central American country&#x27;s Congress next week to make bitcoin legal tender.



#Bitcoin has a market cap of $680 billion dollars.

If 1% of it is invested in El Salvador, that would increase our GDP by 25%.

On the other side, #Bitcoin will have 10 million potential new users and the fastest growing way to transfer 6 billion dollars a year in remittances.

“Drift. Apathy. Distrust,” barked Biggie Too, feeling it, already in a groove.  “Frustration. Irritation. Uneasy anticipation,” continued the chief global strategist for one of Wall Street’s Too-Big-To-Fail affairs.


“Biggie got this deep dark feeling he’s way too early,” whispered Too, lips pursed, right at home in 3rd person. “We lost our faith in politicians and the media. Institutions. Now we’re losing trust in science, our scientists, Biggie sees them cracks spreading,” said Biggie, pointing to his bank of screens, Fauci getting Fox’d.

                    <span>GameStop And AMC Could Soon Be In The Russell 1000 Index

            
If you had said during the beginning of the pandemic we&#x27;d be talking about whether or not retailer GameStop and dying movie chain AMC would be moved from the Russell 2000 up to the large cap Russell 1000 - instead of being dropped from the index altogether - people would have assumed you were joking.


But now that question is legitimately on the table thanks to the astronomical run in both names and the upcoming Russell Reconstitution, according to Bloomberg.


The reconstitution, which takes place on June 25, is going to affect more than $10 trillion in investors&#x27; assets and exchange volumes are usually &quot;among the heaviest of the year&quot; around the time it happens.

Loudoun County, Virginia, has become “ground zero” in the fight against critical race theory-based indoctrination in schools nationwide, according to the co-founder of a parents’ group taking on the local education establishment.

The Anonymous movement - famous for taking on such &quot;untouchable&quot; targets at the Church of Scientology - may now be directing its ire toward Elon Musk.


In what could be a PR nightmare on steroids, the collective of anonymous activists have officially &quot;called for war&quot; against Musk for &quot;manipulating cryptocurrencies, among other alleged sins,&quot; RT reported on Sunday. 







On a Twitter feed with over 5.8 million followers, the @YourAnonCentral account, which has been used for Anonymous news in the past, told Elon Musk in a video: &quot;You may think you are the smartest person in the room, but now you have met your match.&quot;

By Michael Wilson, chief equity strategist of Morgan Stanley


Over the past few weeks, we’ve been spending a lot of time with investors discussing and debating our mid-year outlook. Here are the highlights:



First, investors are definitely more receptive to the mid-cycle transition narrative that we introduced a few months ago. There’s an acknowledgement that something has changed in the market, because more investors are struggling to make money consistently as leadership flip-flops day to day. This is consistent with the typical mid-cycle transition as the market struggles to find the next consensus trade.

Human smugglers along the southern border are openly advertising their services on Facebook and the social media company has fallen short on removing such content.

A plethora of user accounts have posted offers to facilitate illegal border crossings on the platform. Some even directly advertise how much they charge for the service. Rep.

As we move further down the rabbit hole of exactly what in the devil has been going on in China&#x27;s &#x27;bat labs,&#x27; we now turn our attention to one Zhou Yusen - a Chinese military scientist specializing in coronaviruses who collaborated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology&#x27;s &quot;Bat Woman,&quot; Zhengli Shi - with at least one project to geneticially manipulate coronaviruses having been funded by three grants from the National Institutes of Heath (NIH)  - home to Dr. Anthony Fauci - via US universities, according to documents obtained by The Weekend Australian (ostensibly leaked by Aussie intelligence).

Authored by Bryce Coward via Knowledge Leaders Capital blog,


For the second month in a row, the US payroll employment report has come in below expectations. The miss this month was not quite as bad as the miss last month, but was still notable. The market was expecting 675K new jobs, but only 559K were added.


Nearly all of the jobs added were in the leisure &amp; hospitality and education categories. This is unsurprising given re-openings will affect those sectors particularly acutely. But, for the second month in a row we also saw fairly weak numbers out of both construction and manufacturing. Construction jobs fell by 20K while manufacturing jobs only rose by 23K after a 32K decline in April. F…</span>

For the past several months, Morgan Stanley&#x27;s fundamental analysts have been turning increasingly bearish on stocks, with the pessimistic sentiment plateauing earlier this week when chief equity strategist Michael Wilson said that there is far too much optimism in the market, and that while earnings are slowly rising, forward PE multiples are far too high and are set to slide, with &quot;the de-rating about 75% to go or an approximate 15% decline in P/Es from here.&quot; As a result, in Wilson&#x27;s view - which is rapidly emerging as the most bearish on Wall Street - &quot;earnings revisions will not be able to offset that de-rating, leaving the overall market vulnerable to a 10-15 % correction over the…</span>

A person believed to be among the highest-ranking defectors ever to the United States from the People’s Republic of China has been working with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for months, sources inside the intelligence community have told RedState on condition of anonymity.







The defector has direct knowledge of special weapons programs in China, including bioweapons programs, those sources say.


The information provided to RedState corroborates and clarifies Thursday evening’s reporting by journalist Adam Housley.

Are the carbon footprints of EVs really as drastically lower than that of internal combustion engine vehicles? When considering the amount of carbon and CO2 created from assembling lithium ion batteries, one firm thinks the difference could be &quot;negligible&quot;.


Such was the topic of a new blog post by natural resource investors Goehring &amp; Rozencwajg (G&amp;R), a &quot;fundamental research firm focused exclusively on contrarian natural resource investments with a team with over 30 years of dedicated resource experience.&quot;

1. U.S. Taxpayer Money Did Go to Controversial ‘Gain of Function’ Research


Thanks to some confusing verbal gymnastics by Dr. Anthony Fauci, some in the media are giving the impression that there’s no proof U.S. tax money funded “gain of function” research or that, perhaps, the research didn’t qualify as gain of function. However, the evidence on this point is clear cut.


A 2015 published study specifically discloses that the research is gain of function research that took bat coronavirus that was harmless to people—and made it infectious in humans. The study further states that the National Institutes of He…</span>

Last month we noted how hedge fund managers have been descending on Puerto Rico in the hopes of dodging Biden tax hikes, and to take advantage of tax incentives rolled out in 2012 which have lured high net-worth individuals, corporations and cryptocurrency traders alike.







If you fall under any of the above and you&#x27;re falsely claiming to be a resident of Puerto Rico, the IRS has a message for you: &#x27;We&#x27;re waiting for you...&#x27; 


According to Bloomberg Tax, the agency has been the focus of a &quot;sweeping&quot; review to examine individuals who took advantages of the tax incentives. According to the report, &quot;More than 4,000 mainland U.S. residents and firms have moved to the territory between 20…</span>

Donald Trump will return to the political stage Saturday night with a speech at the North Carolina Republican Convention - his first major speech since CPAC in February, but more importantly - his first since he was vindicated over the possibility that COVID-19 escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.







It also comes after anti-Trump GOP Congresswoman Liz Cheney (WY) was outed from her leadership position due to her frequent criticism of Trump.


In a Friday statement, the former president said that it would be &quot;a great honor to be speaking at the North Carolina GOP convention,&quot; adding &quot;I understand the place will be packed, all records broken!&quot;


Trump carried North Carolina during both of his presidential bids - visiting the state 14 times during the final year of his presidency. He&#x27;s scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. to a sold out audience of 1,250 people.

                    <span>COVID, Learned Helplessness, And Control

            
Via WeMeantWell.com,


In the post-vaccination era, why don’t people remove their masks? Learned helplessness, employed as a control tool.







Learned helplessness is well-documented. It takes place when an individual believes he continuously faces a negative, uncontrollable situation and stops trying to improve his circumstances, even when he has the ability to do so. Discovering the loss of control elicits a passive reaction to a harmful situation. Psychologists call this a maladaptive response, characterized by avoidance of challenges and the collapse of problem-solving when obstacles arise. You give up trying to fight back.


An example may help: you must keep up with ever-changing mask and other hygiene theatre rules,…</span>

Delta Flight 386 from Los Angeles to Nashville on Friday was diverted to New Mexico after a passenger attempted to breach the cockpit and hijack the plane.


Albuquerque International Sunport received distress calls from the plane after a passenger attempted to breach the cabin, airport spokeswoman Stephanie Kitts, who was quoted by USA Today. 


Cellphone video captured the incident and one brave flight attendant who &quot;tackled and zip-tied the man before anyone was harmed,&quot; said Fox 11 Los Angeles.

                    <span>A Couple Things About Inflation

            
Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


The higher they push phantom &quot;assets&quot; based on exponential increases in leverage, the greater the air gap between essential tangibles and fantasy.


Inflation is in the news, but there are a couple of things about inflation that don&#x27;t get much coverage. Let&#x27;s start with the trope that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. Actually, no.


When nutrient-rich soil and fresh water reserves are depleted, crop yields decline and as human population and appetites for animal protein soar, food becomes scarce. When food becomes scarce, prices rise accordingly. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you do with money supply, prices will rise in relation to everything used as &quot;money:&quot; gold, shells, paper …</span>

                    <span>Hong Kong Parking Spot Sells For Record-Breaking $1.3 Million

            
Even as thousands of Hong Kongers flee to the UK or elsewhere to escape China&#x27;s crackdown on political freedoms, the city-state&#x27;s property market is breaking yet another record.


Citing a report in the Hong Kong Economic Times, Bloomberg reports that Wharf Holdings and Nan Fung Group sold a parking space for HK$10.2 million ($1.3 million) at the luxury Mount Nicholson residential project, according to a source. The price beat the previous record of HK$7.6 million for a spot in an office tower set back in 2019, before Hong Kong&#x27;s protest movement triggered a crackdown by Beijing that has engulfed the territory&#x27;s future in uncertainty, especially since China can simply snatch anyone - foreign nationals or otherwise - from Hong Kong&#x27;s jurisdiction.







Mount Nicholson has a reputation for being one of the most iconic upscale projects in Hong Kong. At one point, an apartment in the project was the most expensive in Asia before the title was taken by CK Asset Holdings Ltd.’s 21 Borrett Road in February.


As that record-breaking sale might suggest, the parking spot record isn&#x27;t a total surprise. HK has been seeing a comeback in the luxury home market in recent months, seeing record-breaking transactions as buyer&#x27;s confidence returns. A house on Hong Kong&#x27;s famous Peak (a luxury residential area overlooking the rest of the city) just rented for HK$1.6 a month in May.


Still, despite its recent sharp rebound, Hong Kong&#x27;s economy &quot;isn&#x27;t out of the woods just yet,&quot; according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau. HK&#x27;s economy grew 7.9% in the first quarter of 2021 vs. a year ago, marking the first economic expansion after six consecutive quarters of contraction. Yau appeared on CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Squawk Box Asia&quot; Thursday morning to discuss it.





While retail sales have seen a strong rebound, tourism remains weak, and the expansion is on uneven footing, Yau said.

Authored by Finn Andersen via The Mises Institute,


Recently, Joe Rogan, one of the largest podcast hosts in the United States (10.6 million YouTube subscribers), expressed the following opinion about the vaccination of young adults:



If you are 21 and ask me if you should get the vaccine, I would say &quot;no&quot;. If you are a healthy person and exercise all the time, and are young and eat well, I don&#x27;t think you have to worry about this.



Joe Rogan is correct about the COVID vaccine for kids &amp; young healthy people.pic.twitter.com/AxGwFxAMVB

An official event at the Yale School of Medicine featured a New York-based psychiatrist telling students she fantasizes about &quot;unloading a revolver into the head of any white person that got in my way.&quot;


Disturbingly the talk entitled &quot;The Psychopathic Problem of the White Mind&quot; was held as part of the continuing program, the Child Study Center Grand rounds. The event was held in April, but audio only late this week of New York-based Dr. Aruna Khilanani gleefully musing about murdering white people became available and was posted on journalist Bari Weiss&#x27;s Substack.

Authored by Rita Li via The Epoch Times,


A recent report documented up to 6,000 foreign fishing vessels that disabled their public tracking devices for more than 24 hours along the border of Argentina’s national waters, sounding the alarm that they could be illegally fishing in the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).


“The Chinese fleet was responsible for 66 percent of these incidents,” said the June report by Oceana, a Washington-based non-profit organization dedicated to protecting and restoring the global oceans. The report claims that hundreds of Chinese fishing vessels mainly target shortfin squid, which is vital to both Argentina’s economy and ecosystem.

                    <span>Three US Senators Visit Taiwan Sunday In Another Shot Across China&#x27;s Bow

            
Taiwan is about to be front and center again this coming week as Washington prepares for its next shot across China&#x27;s bow - this time by another high level US delegation, something which China has long condemned as &quot;signaling pro-democracy forces&quot; on the island in contradiction to the official One China policy. 


Reuters has confirmed in a weekend report that &quot;Three US senators will visit Taiwan on Sunday and will meet President Tsai Ing-wen to discuss security and other issues, Taiwan&#x27;s government and the de facto U.S. embassy in Taipei said on Saturday, a trip that will likely irritate China.&quot; The meeting is expected to be held at a military wing of the island&#x27;s main international airport.

Authored by Mark Jeftovic via BombThrower.com,


Earlier today the news started coming out that the US will start treating ransomware on par with terrorism. This is in the wake of a string of catastrophic attacks, not only ransomware but also several supply chain attacks.


There is some concern within crypto-currency circles that this may turn into a new FUD-cycle for Bitcoin. There is already no shortage of lo-res intellects calling for a ban on Bitcoin and crypto-currencies, thinking that even if cryptos could be banned (they can’t) that it would eliminate the problem of ransomware.


It wouldn’t.


Here’s why:


Ransomware attacks are neither enabled nor incentivized by the existence of Bitcoin. …</span>

                    <span>&quot;Stonks On The Moon&quot;: There&#x27;s Now A Children&#x27;s Book Based On The GameStop Short Squeeze

            
There&#x27;s now officially a children&#x27;s book based on the &quot;Great GME Squeeze of 2021&quot;.


Amazon has started selling a book called &quot;Stonks On The Moon!&quot; which tells the story - in children&#x27;s parlance - of the &quot;mayhem being inflicted on Wall Street by a new wave of retail investors championing the cause of GameStop Corp,&quot; according to WeBull.


The story tells the tale of Stonks, a young ape, who is helped along by a character based on Keith &quot;Roaring Kitty&quot; Gill in building a rocket to visit the moon. 


According to WeBull, the book&#x27;s author, who goes by the name &quot;Professor Clark&quot; is actually Dillon Clark, who calls himself &quot;an IT professional at a bank in the middle of Illinois in the middle of a cornfield.&quot; 







Clark said: “It&#x27;s kind of a children&#x27;s book for adults and children. A kid can read it and be like, ‘Hey, I understand it. I get a good message from it.&#x27; But then the adult can read it and be like, ‘Oh, I see what&#x27;s going on there&#x27;.”


“It&#x27;s been great,” he stated. “All the apes on Reddit have been super, super nice.”


Clark is also holding out hope that Elon Musk will read the audio version: “I think ‘Stonks on the Moon!’ would be awesome if Elon Musk narrated. I&#x27;ve been tweeting at him every day for the last 35 days, and I&#x27;m doing it for a year straight.”


The book is 25 pages and already has 35 reviews with an average of 5 stars on Amazon, where it started selling on May 27. 







Meanwhile, the Fed still sees no signs of market excess...

Microsoft on Friday said that its search engine Bing yielded no results when users entered the query “tank man” in the United States and elsewhere for part of Friday because of “accidental human error.”







Users in the United States and other countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and Singapore, reported that Bing returned the message “There are no results for tank man” when they tried to search the term.


Meanwhile, rival search engine Google, on the other hand, returned many results for the image when the “tank man” query was entered on Friday.

The day after Putin announced the completion of the first leg of the Russia-to-Germany natural gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, declaring that essentially Washington&#x27;s best efforts to halt it via an avalanche of sanctions have been defeated, Germany appears to have seconded his assessment.


German Ambassador to Russia Geza Andreas von Geyr on Saturday in his own statements on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum said that US efforts are illegal, going against international law.

Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,


Over the last few week’s we discussed the ongoing “buy signals” suggesting the market could retest all-time highs. That occurred this week. However, as stated last week:



“The good news is that we did indeed get the rally we were expecting. The not-so-good news is that the rally already consumed a majority of the ‘buy signal.’ Such does not mean the market is about to correct; it does suggest that upside remains limited near term.”








As shown in the bottom panel, the RIA PRO “Money Flow” signal is now into overbought territory. While the markets could undoubtedly break out to new highs next week, the upside remains limited. Such is due to the weekly sig…</span>

While the luminaries of the crypto world are spending millions of dollar to pitch their favorite tokens and technologies at the world&#x27;s largest cryptoconference in Miami (which due to organizational issues has also been compared to the infamous Fyre Festival scam) hoping to push the prices of bitcoin and its peers higher, Elon Musk had other plans.


First, on Thursday evening, bitcoin tumbled after the Tesla billionaire issued a cryptic tweet that many interpreted as the billionaire’s breakup with bitcoin. The tweet, which included the bitcoin logo and a broken-heart emoji, hinted that Musk may have sold some or all of Tesla&#x27;s bitcoin holdings purchased at the start of the year (Musk has yet to confirm or deny that…</span>

Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times,


Minneapolis saw an outbreak of unrest on Friday night, after a vigil and protests over the shooting death of a man by members of a U.S. Marshals task force devolved into chaotic scenes of looting, arson, and vandalism.

The second night of protests followed Thursday’s fatal shooting of 32-year-old Winston Boogie Smith Jr., who was wanted on a weapons violation and fired a gun before two deputies shot him.


Members of the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force were trying to arrest Smith on a warrant for allegedly being a felon in possessi…</span>

Liberals are probably having a meltdown after a George W. Bush-appointed federal judge in California ruled the state&#x27;s ban on assault weapons is unconstitutional. 







U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez of San Diego released a 94-page ruling late Friday, indicating California&#x27;s three-decade ban on assault weapons violates the Second Amendment&#x27;s right to bear arms.



&quot;Like the Swiss Army Knife, the popular AR-15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment.

A number of events are coming together which are set to push gold prices higher. Besides a combination of continuing inflationary policies and massive future budget deficits undermining the dollar, by closing down derivative market activities new Basel 3 regulations appear set to deflect some demand into physical metals. Furthermore, liquidity in gold markets will contract, potentially making prices more volatile

The G7 group of advanced economies reached a landmark deal Saturday to end the race to the bottom on taxes. 


Finance ministers - from US, UK, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, and Japan - met in London Saturday and agreed to a minimum global corporation tax rate of at least 15%, and also had put in mechanisms within the deal to ensure multinational companies operating in other countries were paying their fair share of taxes.

Authored by Josh Hammer via The Epoch Times,


As even many casual observers of America’s fractious politics are aware, the overwhelming majority of lawmaking at the federal level no longer takes place in Congress as the Constitution’s framers intended. Instead, the vast majority of the “rulemaking” governing Americans’ day-to-day lives now takes place behind closed doors, deep in the bowels of the administrative state’s sprawling bureaucracy. The brainchild of progressive President Woodrow Wilson, arguments on behalf of the modern administrative state are ultimately rooted in, among other factors, a disdain for the messy give-and-take of republican politics and an epistemological preference for rul…</span>

Cows produce significant amounts of methane as part of their digestive processes. Cow belching, a source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, could be solved by a new methane-absorbing wearable device. 


According to Bloomberg, agriculture behemoth Cargill Inc. tapped UK-based startup Zelp Ltd., which is dedicated to significantly reducing the environmental impact of the livestock industry through smart cow masks that filter methane burps. 







Cargill said Tuesday the devices would be used for its European dairy farmers in 2022. The price of each mask has yet to be publicly discussed, but Zelp said each cow would cost $80 per year as part of an annual subscription fee.

By Construction Dive,




	
Closures due to the Covid pandemic resulted in $9.8 billion in lost construction activity and 74,000 direct and indirect lost jobs in New York City, according to a report by the Building Trades Employers’ Association. The decline in jobs contributed to a $5.5 billion loss in total wages, the report said.

	

	

	
The decline in activity also affected the city&#x27;s Minority and Women Business Enterprises, as more than 85% of MWBEs are expected to be out of businesses in the next six months, according to a New York City Comptroller&#x27;s Office survey cited in the report.

South Korea has become ground zero for speculative crypto traders looking to try and build wealth by hoisting their life savings into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.


This means wild successes when the price bitcoin and other coins moves higher, but also devastating mood swings when cryptos crash.

Authored by Jon Sanders via The American Institute for Economic Research,


If you’re among those of us who aren’t tribally invested in Covid politics but would like good information about when life will resume as normal, chances are you’re interested in herd immunity. You’re likely not interested in having to rely on the Internet Archive for good information on herd immunity. Alas, it’s become a go-to place for retrieving, as it were, previously published information on herd immunity that became inconvenient post-vaccine and then virtually Memory-Holed.

Former Temple University business school dean Moshe Porat is defending inflating his school&#x27;s ranking to U.S. News and World Report by feeding the periodical false data. 


Porat asked a judge to dismiss fraud charges against him in a May 28 court filing, claiming &quot;that the government hadn’t sufficiently shown that he profited from the alleged scheme,&quot; Bloomberg reports.


This was, of course, while he was running the school&#x27;s Richard J. Fox School of Business, which he headed up for more than 20 years.

Authored by Ryan McMaken via The Mises Institute,


In twenty-first century America, millions of Americans—Christians and social conservatives especially—are finding that the nation’s most influential institutions appear to be implacably hostile toward them.


These institutions include universities, public schools, the news media, and government bureaucracies. Moreover, corporate America has increasingly embraced a posture of hostility toward groups considered to be “right wing” or conservative.

More than a year since the virus pandemic began, New York City&#x27;s economy is roaring back open. But at least one segment of the metro area&#x27;s economy remains in dire straits: the office space market. 


According to Bloomberg, citing a commercial real estate brokerage report by Colliers, Manhattan&#x27;s supply of office space continues to hit new records even as leasing increases. 


The availability rate rose for a 12th straight month in May to 17%; inventory since the pandemic began jumped 70% to a whopping 92 million square feet. 


Colliers had some good news. It said demand is coming back with leases increasing 8% versus last May, while the average asking rents rose 0.4% to $73.26 a square foot.

                    <span>MSM Wastes No Time Using Senate UFO Report To Promote Arms Race

            
After more than two years of UFO &#x27;evidence&#x27; via the New York Times detailing dozens of encounters between Navy pilots and unidentified aerial phenomena, the punchline - according to an upcoming government report, is: &#x27;we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s aliens, but it&#x27;s not Americans&#x27; - and therefore America should probably spend untold billions on figuring out how to make 90-degree turns at mach 5 and disappear into the ocean, after disabling a nuclear installation.


Or, as journalist Caitlin Johnstone puts it: The MSM is wasting no time using the UFO report to promote an arms race.

Yesterday Russia announced the dramatic news at its own &#x27;Davos-style&#x27; economic forum in St. Petersburg which is running this week that it will dump the US dollar from its $186 billion National Wealth Fund. As we detailed previously it comes as Washington continues to tighten the sanctions screws on Moscow, blaming it for everything from a series corporate cyberattacks that&#x27;s appeared to target American infrastructure to election interference to expansionist aims in Ukraine to cracking down on opposition activists.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Most Americans believe that the coronavirus pandemic originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, with almost a quarter saying they believe it was released on purpose, according to a YouGov poll.







A total of 58% of Americans agree that its is ‘definitely or probably true’ that the virus came out of the Wuhan lab.

Only 13% are still buying the ‘it mutated naturally from bats’ claim.


Indeed, YouGov notes “When it comes to the more specific circumstances of the virus’ emergence, 24% think it was created in a laboratory and was released on purpose, 18% think it was lab-created and escaped by accident, while a further 12% think it was a naturally occurring disease that was being examined in a laboratory but was released by accident.”


This is despite a massive co-ordinated attempt by the establishment media and big-tech to censor and dismiss the lab leak idea as a crazy ‘conspiracy theory’.

I always thought that if you lived through a revolution it would be obvious to everyone. As it turns out, that’s not true. Revolutions can be bloodless, incremental and subtle. And they don’t require a strongman.

Revered scientific journal The Lancet has created a ‘task force’ to investigate the origins of the coronavirus that caused a global pandemic, yet it has decided to employ as it’s leader the very guy who funded the dangerous gain of function research at the Wuhan lab and subsequently allegedly ‘bullied’ other scientists into avoiding looking into the lab as a potential source of the outbreak.







In the wake of renewed scrutiny of the lab leak hypothesis, the Lancet’s task force will reportedly “focus on analyzing data on all of the theories put forward on the origins of COVID, on the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 was …</span>

Joe Biden&#x27;s Universal Basic Income is making the unprecedented labor shortage and general chaos in the labor market worse by the day. Two months ago we first made a remarkable observation: despite some 100 million Americans not in the labor force (of which 94 million do not want a job)...







... there is now a full-blown labor shortage in the US, for one simple reason - trillions in Biden stimulus are now incentivizing potential workers not to seek gainful employment, but to sit back and collect the next stimmy check for doing absolutely nothing in what is becoming the world&#x27;s greatest &quot;under the radar&quot; experiment in Universal Basic Income.

                    <span>Traders Rush To Ship Masked Venezuelan Crude To China

            
Authored by Charles Kennedy via OilPrice.com,


Commodity traders are in a rush to ship as much Venezuelan heavy crude to China as possible before a new fuel tax kicks in, causing a 40-50-percent rise in prices, Reuters reports, citing industry insiders and shipping data.







Over the last 12 months, China has seen a 13-fold increase in imports of bitumen blends, some 90 percent of which was actually heavy crude from Venezuela, according to data from cargo tracker Vortexa Analytics. The crude was labeled as Malaysian bitumen blend to avoid sanction action from the United States.


According to Vortexa, the average daily rate of Venezuelan oil imports into China over the past year was some 324,000 barrels, which represented about two-thirds of Venezuela&#x27;s total exports of crude during the period.


However, things are about to change as China plans to introduce a tax on bitumen blend imports later this month. This will increase prices by 40 to 50 percent, and the flow of Venezuelan oil may well thin considerably.



&quot;While not all of the 350,000 to 400,000 bpd of the additional bitumen flowing into China will disappear overnight, a large proportion of it will be at risk,&quot; an Energy Aspects analyst told Reuters.



U.S. sanctions have reduced Venezuelan oil output to some half a million barrels daily over the two years since they were introduced.







Even though the Biden administration has extended a sanction waiver for several U.S. oil companies, including Chevron and Halliburton, PDVSA is struggling to maintain production.


Earlier this year, the state-owned oil major calculated it would need investments of $58 billion to boost production to where it was before Hugo Chavez rose to power in the late 90s. In 1998, Venezuela was pumping 2.3 million barrels of crude daily. The company said it planned to seek investments from both local and foreign companies to that end.

Ahead of the G-20 summit in the UK later this month, finance ministers from the G-7 are reportedly on the cusp of a deal for a minimum corporate tax rate of &quot;at least 15%&quot;, while differences remain about how megacap tech firms should be taxed.

According to Bloomberg, the ministers are meeting on Friday and Saturday in London, and will likely release a statement over the weekend once they have settled on a mutually-agreeable framework.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Senator Rand Paul, who has constantly challenged the contradictory and unscientific statements of Dr Fauci, as well as pointing out Fauci’s involvement in funding gain of function research with coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, appeared vindicated in an interview Thursday following disturbing revelations from released emails, which Paul urged should be the final nail in Fauci’s coffin.







Speaking to Laura Ingraham, Paul asserted that “The emails paint a disturbing picture, a disturbing picture of Dr. Fauci, from the very beginning, worrying that he had been funding gain-of-function research. He knows it to this day, but hasn’t admitted it.”

                    <span>22.4 Down, 14.7 Up, 7.6 To Go: &quot;The Fed Faces A Difficult Decision&quot;

            
After today’s mixed US payrolls report, today’s Chart of the Day from DB&#x27;s Jim Reid shows we are still 7.6 million jobs away from where we were when the pandemic hit. 


We lost 22.4 million in the first 2 months and have gained 14.7 million over the last 13 months. 2021 has &quot;only&quot; seen an average monthly payrolls increase of 478k though May.







And while some saw only disappointment in the May jobs data, it was a truly Goldilocks report: as Reid says, &quot;there was clearly something for everyone in the report. The Fed will continue to suggest they are a long way from their employment goals and the inflationists will cite the higher earnings in the release as evidence that it&#x27;s hard to find employees at the right price.&quot;


Meanwhile, according to BofA, the report leaves the Fed &quot;to remain patient, slowly and carefully taking baby steps to set the stage for tapering but unlikely to send an explicit signal until the September FOMC meeting.&quot;


Maybe, Reid asks, you can have a relatively slow jobs recovery and inflation.



&quot;If that does happen then the Fed will have difficult decisions to make at some point.&quot; 



On that, the DB strategist concludes that &quot;next week&#x27;s US CPI will be the most watched economic report of the year so far.&quot;

Real Vision editors Max Wiethe and Jack Farley make sense of a truly odd week, one that began with the reappearance of memestock mania and ended with the S&amp;P 500 flirting with all-time highs (and with the VIX very close to a pre-pandemic low). Farley and Wiethe cover today’s strong rally in stocks as well as bonds, on the release of the U.S. non-farm payrolls data which missed economist expectations. Farley inspects Bill Ackman’s latest plans to acquire a slice of Universal Music Group via his SPAC, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings ($PSTH), and Wiethe looks forward to next week’s Fed meeting and release of the latest inflation data.

Authored by MN Gordon via EconomicPrism.com,


Jerome Powell might be done as a useful Federal Reserve Chairman.  Not that Fed Chairs provide a use that’s of any real value.  They mainly excel at destroying the wealth of wage earners and savers for the benefit of member banks.


But as Powell loses a grip on price inflation the business of supplying credit at a fixed rate of return becomes less fruitful.  Consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), is rising at an annual rate of 4.2 percent.  That’s well above interest rate of a 30 year fixed mortgage, which is currently 3.1 percent.


It doesn’t take much imagination to foresee a CPI over 6 percent.  At that rate of price inflation, what good t…</span>

Despite objections from government scientists and prominent businessmen, Japan is planning to move ahead with the postponed 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo next month. In an interview with the Japanese press, the president of the 2020 Games, Seiko Hashimoto, declared that the games would move ahead as planned, with the Japanese government taking certain precautions to prevent an outbreak of mutant COVID. 







&quot;We cannot postpone again,&quot; Hashimoto told the Nikkan Sports newspaper via Reuters.


Hashimoto, who competed in seven summer and winter Olympics as a cyclist and skater, also told the BBC that while Japanese were understandably worried, they should be reassured …</span>

Authored by Alex Wu via The Epoch Times,


The COVID-19 epidemic in Guangdong province continues to worsen. The Epoch Times has learned that one of the busiest commercial streets in the mega city of Shenzhen has just been closed due to infection. Meanwhile, in the provincial capital of Guangzhou city, food and medicine shortages have been reported in locked down areas.

In the US, the first winners of the &quot;vaccination lotteries&quot; being adopted by a growing number of states - including West Virginia (which is offering guns, trucks &amp; &quot;piles of cash), California and a handful of others - are taking home life-changing money, all because they decided to get vaccinated.







And according to WSJ, the incentives that these programs create are already having a positive impact on the vaccination rate, which has finally eclipsed 50% of American adults. The program is also having some success in Hong Kong.





But while it&#x27;s impossible to determine exactly how many people are getting vaccinated because of the potential monetary rewards created by…</span>

Authored by Cathy He and Jen Jekielek via The Epoch Times,


A proposed Chinese wind farm in Texas poses national security concerns, warned China-watcher and hedge fund manager Kyle Bass.







The Blue Hills Wind development in southwest Texas’s Val Verde County has attracted heightened scrutiny in recent months, with lawmakers and experts signaling concern that the Chinese project could be used as a cover for espionage and to disrupt the state’s power grid.


The proposed wind farm site is about 30 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border and near the Laughlin Air Force Base, the U.S. Air Force’s largest pilot training facility.


The land for the wind farm is owned by a Chinese company called…</span>

Bill Ackman&#x27;s massive SPAC is reportedly nearing a transaction to take public Universal Music Group, the world’s largest music business, at a valuation of about $40 billion, the WSJ reported citing sources.


Back in July, Ackman’s special purpose acquisition company, called Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd., raised $4 billion in an initial public offering - a record amount for a SPAC to this day, as Ackman said that his firm was on the hunt for a “mature unicorn&quot;:

Authored by Glenn Greenwald via greenwald.substack.com,


One of the most significant events of the last two decades has been largely memory-holed: the October, 2001 anthrax attacks in the U.S. Beginning just one week after 9/11 and extending for another three weeks, a highly weaponized and sophisticated strain of anthrax had been sent around the country through the U.S. Postal Service addressed to some of the country&#x27;s most prominent political and media figures. As Americans were still reeling from the devastation of 9/11, the anthrax killed five Americans and sickened another seventeen.

With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu engaged in desperate 11th hour scrambling to try and pick off enough lawmakers on the right-wing to deny a power-sharing government under an unlikely coalition formed by Yamina leader Naftali Bennett, Yesh Atid head Yair Lapid and Ra&#x27;am (United Arab List) chairman Mansour Abbas - Iran has taken a moment to mock Israel&#x27;s longest serving prime minister as he&#x27;s on his way out.

Authored by Victor Davis Hanson via PJMedia.com,


During America’s first-ever national lockdown, thousands of unelected bureaucrats, as well as federal and state governments, assumed enormous powers not usually accorded to them.







They picked and chose which businesses could stay open without much rationale. They sent the infected into nursing homes occupied by the weak and vulnerable.


Their rules for prosecuting those who violated social distancing, sheltering in place, mask wearing or violent protesting often hinged on political grounds. Their spending measures on “infrastructure” and “health care” were excuses to lard up redistributive entitlements.

Think wage wars are only taking place among minimum wage workers, who (until September at least) are getting paid more from Uncle Sam to stay home and do nothing? Think again.


Amid numerous anecdotes of sticky wages at the high-end of the jobs spectrum, one stands out: as Bloomberg reports today, in September 2020, the Palo Alto-based Cooley law firm announced it was handing out $2,500 to $7,500 in one-time payments to associates. The bonuses came as the firm -  along with many others in the legal industry - realized it was both flush with cash and facing worker burnout during the pandemic.

By OilPrice.com


Electric cars giant Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) said it expects to soon begin buying more than $1 billion a year of Australian lithium, nickel and other critical minerals for its batteries and engines. Chairman Robyn Denholm said the country has taken important steps towards cleaning its image of polluting commodities exporter and it is poised to become a globally significant supplier of climate change solutions.


“Australia has the minerals to power the renewable energy age throughout the world in the coming years,” Denholm, an Australian, said in a speech during a Minerals Council of Australia event.

Update (1800ET): Just when you thought it was safe to turn off your AMC-focused mind, after an extremely volatile trading day, AMC filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC in connection with the Company’s 2021 Annual Meeting scheduled for July 29, 2021.


The preliminary proxy statement, which is subject to SEC review, includes the following important proposals:




	
Increase authorized share capital by 25 million shares (effective in 2022)

This will hardly come as a surprise to anyone who followed the manic reddit-driven action over the past 48 hours: according to Goldman&#x27;s Prime Brokerage, we just witnessed the &quot;largest US single stock short covering since mid-March amid a sharp rally in High Retail Sentiment stocks&quot; and while US stocks saw modest net buying yesterday, it was driven by risk-off flows &quot;with short covers outpacing long sales 3 to 1.&quot;


The catalyst is well known: a furious, face-ripper of a rally in the heavily-shorted meme stocks, which pushed the Goldman Retail Sentiment Basket, (GSCBHTBR) i.e., the retail favorite stocks up +25% yesterday and up +61% over the last 7 sessions!

Isn’t is amazing how quickly things seem to change when it’s in the interest of those that think they run the world? For years we’ve been trying to get access to Hillary Clinton’s missing e-mails as Secretary of State but to no avail. However, at the most opportune time in the collapsing COVID story, Dr. Anthony Fauci’s emails are uncovered and broadcast to the world.


The same mechanism, FOIA, that Hillary has stonewalled us on for six years uncovers Fauci’s emails in six weeks?







Doesn’t that strike you as just the slightest bit odd?

                    <span>Ford And General Motors Are Blowing EV Sales Out Of The Water

            
Someone should put Elon Musk on notice: the legacy automakers have officially entered the EV sales fray.


And domestic U.S. automakers have officially hit the ground running.


Ford announced on Thursday that U.S. sales were up 4.1% to 161,725 units in May, while YTD sales were up 11.3%. The &quot;everything bubble&quot; created by Central Banks helped truck sales rise 11.6% over the same period and SUV sales to rise 48.6%. These numbers were despite the auto industry continuing to grapple with a semiconductor shortage - one that had even left Ford trucks stranded on the side of the road, waiting for parts, earlier this year. 


But the standout in Ford&#x27;s report? EV sales were up 184% to 10,364 units. The company al…</span>

                    <span>Biden Signals &#x27;Major Changes&#x27; To Tax Proposal To Win GOP Support

            
It appears the Biden administration has realized their ambitious tax hikes have a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell of passing, given the slim majority Democrats hold in both chambers of Congress - which include two serious moderates (Manchin and Sinema) and a parliamentarian who won&#x27;t let them get away with forcing legislation through via reconciliation (a simple majority).


Now, according to the Washington Post, Biden has outlined a plan for $1 trillion in new spending financed through tax changes which would not focus on raising the top corporate rate - a major concession to Republicans who opposed an earlier proposal to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


For about 1 in 4, Social Security provides at least 90 percent of their income.


How many retired workers are getting less than $1,000 per month in Social Security benefits? The question came up and I was curious enough to find the answer, and download the data into an Excel spreadsheet which I saved as a PDF that you can review here. Note that this data is for the 46.5 million retired workers only, and does not include benefits paid to survivors, spouses, disabled, etc.


This led to a deep dive into the basic numbers of Social Security beneficiaries and expenses, which are summarized in the chart below. Here are the basics:




	
Population of the US: 331 million

Update (1650ET): It appears former President Trump has read a few more of Fauci&#x27;s real ouchies exposed by the FOIA-driven email extravaganza and he doesn&#x27;t like what he&#x27;s reading.


In a statement released via NewsMax&#x27;s Steve Cortes, Trump demands reparations from China for unleashing hell on the world...



Now everyone, even the so-called &quot;enemy&quot;, are beginning to say that President Trump was right about the China Virus coming from the Wuhan Lab.


The correspondence between Dr. Fauci and China speaks too loudly for anyone to ignore.


China should pay Ten Trillion Dollars to America, and the World, for the death and destruction they have caused!

A dangerous heatwave plagues much of the Western US this week as scorching heat pushes towards the east through the weekend and into early next week. 


Heat warnings and advisories are in effect from the California/Mexico border to Washington state, where temperatures anomalies are 30 degrees above normal in some areas. 


&quot;Extreme heat in these locations will significantly increase the potential for heat-related illnesses,&quot; the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) warned. 


&quot;Additionally, much of the Southwest and West is experiencing severe to exceptional drought conditions, which will undoubtedly be exacerbated by the current heatwave,&quot; added WPC.

                    <span>How Biden&#x27;s Favored Unions Could Get Jammed in His Infrastructure Traffic

            
By Vince Bielski, RealClearInvestigations


President Biden repeatedly insists that his infrastructure plan will create millions of jobs and labor unions will be the big winners. But interviews with economists, union leaders, government officials and trade groups as well as basic math suggest otherwise.


The once dominant trade and construction unions no longer have enough members outside of their strongholds on both coasts and in the Midwest to claim most of the projected infrastructure jobs. By some estimates, two-thirds of these jobs will go to nonunion workers who dominate the construction markets in most states.


Biden, in short, appears to be harking back nostalgically to an era of union…</span>

                    <span>No Joke: Babylon Bee Activates Lawyers After NYT Defamation

            
Since its inception in March of 2016, the Babylon Bee has made a name for itself as the most hilarious satire website in the known universe - cranking out headlines that would fool only the most abject of morons with no inner monologue, while making the rest of us spit coffee all over our screens.

As the site has risen in popularity (with an estimated 5 million visits per month), liberal &#x27;fact checkers&#x27; began smearing the Bee by fact checking obvious satire.

                    <span>Jefferies Prime Brokerage Suspends Short Sales In AMC, GameStop And MicroVision

            
Pouring more fuel on what was already today&#x27;s dumpster fire of a market, Bloomberg reported that according to a memo it had seen, Jefferies told clients its prime brokerage arm will no longer allow the execution of short sells in meme stocks such as AMC, GameStop and MicroVision.


“Until further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options in GME, AMC and MVIS,” the memo noted. The firm will no longer allow the execution of short sells of those securities, the memo continued, noting that other stocks may be added to that list.


The news comes in a rollercoaster session for AMC which after plunging as much as 30% on news it was selling 11.55MM shares in an At The Market offering, reversed all losses after announcing it had completed the offering, gaining as much as 10% before again reversing the move and last seen down about 9% at $57. Expect much more drama here.

                    <span>&quot;People Are Panicking Now&quot; - Container Ship Charter Rates &quot;Have Gone Out Of Control&quot;

            
By Greg Miller of American Shipper,


In a sign of just how frenzied the container market has become, a freight forwarder is reportedly paying $135,000 per day for a short-term charter of the S Santiago, a 15-year-old container ship with a capacity of 5,060 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).



“Charter rates for short employment … have gone out of control,” said Alphaliner in its new weekly report.



“Depending on the sources, the ship would have obtained anything between $100,000 and $145,000 per day, an absolute historic high. The name of the charterer has not been fully confirmed, although it is believed to be a forwarder.”

                    <span>&quot;That Was A Lie&quot;: Tucker Carlson Levels Fauci After FOIA Emails Connect The Dots

            
Fox News&#x27; Tucker Carlson ripped &quot;the utter fraudulence of Tony Fauci&quot; Wednesday night, after BuzzFeed and the Washington Post obtained thousands of pages of emails through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, revealing that the nation&#x27;s top virologist was telling the public one thing, while furiously working on damage control and narrative-shaping as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded.







According to Carlson, Americans assumed &quot;that the man in charge of protecting the US from COVID must be rational and impressive,&quot; adding &quot;We also assumed he must be honest. But we were wrong.

                    <span>New York City Paid 114,000 Highly-Compensated Public Employees Earning $100,000+

            
Authored by Adam Andrzejewski via RealClear Policy (emphasis ours),


New York City had more than 114,000 municipal workers earning $100,000 or more in 2019. That is up sharply from 76,166 employees with pay exceeding $100,000 in 2016.







Data comes a year before the pandemic hit and is the latest year available.


These were not just high-level employees like agency commissioners or deputy mayors. NYC employees included thermostat repairmen making up to $198,630; regular laborers hauling away $213,169; electricians taking home $253,132; and plumbers pocketing up to $286,245.


The cost of benefits would be additional and is not included in these figures.


These large paychecks are only sustainable because Congress bailed out New York City for $4.3 billion in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The federal bailout more than covered the overstated deficits of the city.


City officials estimated a $5.5 billion gap, but actual revenues came in $2.7 billion higher. Using $1.2 billion from reserves, and finding $1 billion in unspecified labor savings, among other things closed the budget gap.


Therefore, the federal money now exists for extra spending.


In December, Fitch Ratings downgraded New York City’s bond rating and issued a negative outlook. That was after Moody’s Investors Service lowered the credit ratings of both the state and city in October.

A handful of states, including California, Colorado, Maryland, New Jersey, and Ohio, offer vaccine incentive programs as subtle ways to encourage reluctant adults to get vaccinated. The latest is West Virginia, offering residents who get immunized the chance to win a tricked-out truck, hunting rifle, college scholarship, and the opportunity to win a $1.588 million grand prize, according to CNN.

Authored by Caitlin Johnstone via Medium.com,


I’ve been learning as much as I can about the new UFO narrative the political/media class have been pushing in conjunction with the US military to prepare for the Senate report that’s due to be released this month.


One of the disconcerting things I’ve been seeing again and again from all the major players in this new narrative like Lue Elizondo and Christopher Mellon is the absurd assertion that not only is it entirely possible that the unknown phenomena allegedly being regularly witnessed by military personnel are extraterrestrial in origin, but that if they are extraterrestrial they may want to hurt us.

Landlords across the country, the least-pitied group of Americans, were handed a loss on Wednesday after  a federal appeals court in Washington DC denied a request to resume evictions amid a contentious dispute over a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) moratorium during the pandemic.







To recap, last month US District Judge Dabney Friedrich struck down the CDC moratorium on evictions, finding that the agency had overstepped its authority - yet agreeing to block her own ruling from taking immediate affect in order for the Biden administration to launch an appeal, according to The Hill.


In response, the plaintiffs - which includes the Alabama Association of Realtors and several co-plaintiffs - aske…</span>

Authored by Andy Puzder via RealClearPolitics.com, 


In a speech last week introducing his proposed $6 trillion 2022 budget, President Biden claimed that the benefits of the Republican Party’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act “went to the wealthiest 1% of America.”


It’s not the first time he’s made this claim.


In his first speech to a joint session of Congress, Biden described the TCJA as a “huge windfall” for “those at the very top.” 


To right that wrong, he proposes getting rid of loopholes and raising the top tax rate from its current 37% to 39.6%.


Why? So that “the wealthiest 1% of Americans” will “pay their fair share,” a phrase that the president and his fellow Democrats repeat with abandon.

                    <span>SoftBank-Backed Construction-Industry-&quot;Transforming&quot; Company Katerra Collapses After Billions In Investment

            
Oh how the mighty continue to fall.


Katerra, the construction giant that was backed by SoftBank, has officially told its employees that it is shutting down its operations. Katerra “had promised to shake up the construction industry with its efficient factories, prefab parts and modular construction units,” Bloomberg had reported on the company in the past.


But now the only thing it&#x27;s shaking up are the lives of the 8,000 employees it had globally, as of last year, according to TechCrunch, who pointed out that the company had already struggled &quot;to find a viable business in cheaply building properties for real estate developers&quot;.


The company was then beset by climbing labor and material costs associated with the pandemic (and perhaps now, the hyperinflation that&#x27;s succeeding the pandemic). 


&quot;So, you guys use a lot of lumber, or no?&quot;


SoftBank tried to bail out the struggling company, offering $200 million on top of the billions it had already invested in the company, to buy a majority stake. But, not unlike the WeWork IPO, Katerra couldn&#x27;t be saved. 


Bloomberg reports that the company is now likely going to walk away from &quot;dozens&quot; of projects it has already committed to. 


Among those being laid off are 117 workers in Seattle, according to The Seattle Times. The losses are expected to take effect on June 4. 


CEO Masayoshi Son had called Katerra one of his &quot;regrets&quot; in an interview with Barron&#x27;s last month. The company had raised more than $2 billion since its founding in 2015.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


A report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned that a recent labor shortage plaguing businesses nationwide is worsening, describing the situation as a “national economic crisis.”







The Chamber’s report released Tuesday found that the United States had a record 8.1 million vacant job openings in March—the last month where data was available—noting it was an increase of 600,000 from February.


But, the Chamber stressed that there “are approximately half as many available workers for every open job,” or 1.4 available workers per job opening, across the country “and the ratio continues to fall.” Compared with the previous 20 years, the…</span>

As the lead federal investigative agency fighting cyber threats, combating cybercrime is one of the FBI&#x27;s highest priorities.

Authored by Mike Shedlock via MishTalk.com,


How big is Biden&#x27;s $6 trillion budget and what are the admitted implications?







That seemingly simple question is the subject of a scathing attack on Biden by the Washington Post.


WaPo Columnist Marc A. Thiessen says Biden’s Budget is a Lie.



Q: How big a lie? 

A: Another $5.8 trillion.



Thiessen calculates that by adding up all of Biden&#x27;s campaign promises and items in the budget that are not reasonable estimates.

It&#x27;s official: just before midnight local time Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid of Yesh Atid party notified President Reuven Rivlin that he&#x27;s successfully formed a power-sharing government, which means the country&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is out.


The 71-year-old Netanyahu has long been dubbed &quot;the magician&quot; by supporters for his history of being able to politically survive time and again against multiple near-misses. But as Axios notes, &quot;But he&#x27;s not out quite yet&quot; - and there&#x27;s still time to wreak havoc on Iran in a desperate bid to cancel the nuclear deal with world powers.

Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


On Tuesday, the new head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency suggested more Israeli covert attacks and assassinations inside Iran should be expected even as the US and other world powers are negotiating a revival of the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA.


&quot;The Iranian program will continue feeling Mossad’s might. We are well acquainted with the nuclear program and its various components, we know personally the factors that operate in it and also the forces that drive them,&quot; David Barnea said at his swearing-in ceremony, as quoted by Israel’s Ynet.

                    <span>Step Aside AMC: Here Are The Most Shorted Stocks Right Now

            
Four months after the Reddit crew sparked a historic market-wide short squeeze across a handful of small and mid-cap companies, which knocked out some of the most respected hedge funds in the world with Melvin Capital requiring a multi-billion bailout from Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen, the squeeze is back sending heavily shorted names like AMC, whose short interest we pointed out last week was off the charts...



AMC short interest pic.twitter.com/w9oIsRK7cK

— zerohedge (@zerohedge) May 25, 2021


... and which has exploded higher, a squeeze which has now shifted over to names such as Bed Bath and Beyond and various other small and mid-cap names.







Of course, there is no mystery what&#x27;s behind this: just like in late January when the meme squeeze phenomenon first emerged, the common theme here is that all these stocks are extremely heavily shorted, and retail investors are seeking to squeeze the shorts once again and thus time with even more stimmy power.


To be sure, one look at the chart of the most heavily shorted names shows what&#x27;s going on.







So, just like in late January, we have compiled a list of the most heavily shorted names. It may come as a surprise to some that the former leaders here, GME and AMC are not even in the top 30.


So which companies are? Below we have screened for the most shorted Russell 2000 names (based on SI as a % of float), and which we will use to constitute our latest and greatest short basket.







If the performance of our previous most shorted index is any indication, going long a market cap-weighted basket of these names - and especially the smaller, less liquid ones - could turn out to be the trade of the year, if not a lifetime.

We have a pretty good idea of what&#x27;s behind the latest reddit meltup.


Unlike the March and April, when hedge funds remained largely inert on a net basis, still smarting from the bruising their short books suffered during the January and February meme stock meltups, May saw a renewed push to short beaten down names, with Goldman&#x27;s Prime Brokerage reporting that its book was net sold for a second straight month, driven by short sales outpacing long buys 1.3 to 1.


According to GS Prime, trading flows in Single Names remained especially active both long and short, and made up approx. 85% of the global gross activity, the balance going to ETFs. That said, while macro products (Index and…</span>

President Biden is preparing to amend a sweeping US ban on trading with Chinese firms with connections to the PLA, China&#x27;s military, after the policy, initially proposed by President Trump, was challenged in court.


According to Bloomberg, under Biden’s amended order, the Treasury Department will create a list of companies that could face financial penalties for their connection to China’s defense and surveillance technology sectors, the people said.  Previously, the nature of the financial sanctions and the specific companies targeted were set via a Congressionally mandated report from the Pentagon.

The Fed’s first-ever foray into directly bailing out the corporate bond market will apparently come to a final close in the next few months (they hope).







The vehicle, known as the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, or SMCCF, holds about $13.7 billion in already-outstanding corporate bonds.


The SMCCF ceased operations on December 31, 2020.


$5.21 billion of bonds from individual companies including Whirlpool, Walmart, and Visa (as of April 30, 2021, 45 bonds matured, 112 had been redeemed early, and 1,204 bonds remain outstanding in the SMCCF).


Approximately half of the bonds in the SMCCF will mature by the end of 2023. As seen in the chart below, while most bonds will mature in 202…</span>

                    <span>Oil Algos Confused After Big Crude Draw, Product Build

            
Oil prices rallied on the day as signs of a demand recovery from the US to Europe stoke optimism among producers and analysts in the crude market, combined with waning hopes for an Iran nuke deal.


Oil is in “strong demand right now,” with economies around the world opening up, Daniel Yergin, the oil historian and vice chairman at consultant IHS Markit Ltd., said in a Bloomberg Television interview.



&quot;Oil is bid on the Iran timeline to adding barrels getting kicked further into the future--sometime between August and the fall,&quot; says Bob Yawger at Mizuho.



After last week&#x27;s across-the-board draws, analysts expected another week of demand dominance.

While crude stocks tumbled more than expected, gasoline and distillate stocks unexpectedly rose last week...

WTI hovered just below $68.80 ahead of the API print and barely budged on the mixed data...







“There’s plenty of room for upside here,” said Bob Yawger, head of the futures division at Mizuho Securities.


“Summer and the reopening of the economy is bullish for demand,” while “it looks much less likely we’ll have Iranian barrels any time soon than it did last week.”


But, the question now is whether oil prices can hold their gains &quot;amid strong demand, despite plenty of downside risk on the supply side,&quot; said Robbie Fraser, global research &amp; analytics manager at Schneider Electric, in a daily report.

Authored by Glenn Greenwald via greenwald.substack.com,


The Department of Homeland Security on Friday issued a new warning bulletin, alerting Americans that domestic extremists may well use violence on the 100th Anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre. This was at least the fourth such bulletin issued this year by Homeland Security (DHS) warning of the same danger and, thus far, none of the fears it is trying to instill into the American population has materialized.

According to every career economist, market strategist and Fed lackey, inflation is transitory. The most important man on Wall Street disagrees.


Speaking at a virtual event hosted by Deutsche Bank, Blackrock CEO Larry Fink who manages more money than the Fed (over $9 trillion at last check) countered soothing talk that soaring prices are here and gone tomorrow, and said that investors may be underestimating the potential for a spike in inflation.



&quot;Most people haven’t had a forty-plus year career, and they’ve only seen declining inflation over the last 30-plus years. So this is going to be a pretty big shock&quot;, Fink said, his warning falling on deaf ears.

Authored by Daniel Lacalle,


The first thing any economist should do wen reading a budget proposal is to analyse the basic macro assumptions and the results presented by the administration. When both are poor, the budget should be criticised. This is the case of the Biden Budget Plan.







Same growth, a lot more debt and less employment.


According to the administration, the impact on growth of this budget will be negligible, as their own -and optimistic- estimates see no change in the slowdown of the U.S. economic growth trend.

Iran now says that remaining contested issues between it and the United States are &quot;not unsolvable&quot; and that all parties appear in agreement on this point at a moment the latest round of talks in Vienna are wrapping up. The Islamic Republic&#x27;s deputy foreign minister and chief negotiator Abbas Araghchi told state TV on Wednesday that of nuclear issues which remain, presumably including the dropping of US sanctions, they &quot;have reached a point where everyone believes that they’re not unsolvable.&quot;

Authored by Jamie Joseph via The Epoch Times,


Los Angeles is set ablaze up to 24 times a day. The cause? Thousands of homeless encampments...







This year, fires started in homeless encampments have accounted for 54 percent of the blazes battled by the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), according to officials—a sharp uptick compared to 2020.


As the county grapples with more than 66,000 people living on its streets, critics are pointing to the growing number of fires caused by the homeless as another indication that officials are mishandling the crisis. And in parts of the city where the homeless are concentrated, residents and business owners say their concerns are not being heard.

U.S. troops tasked with guarding nuclear bombs in Europe accidentally leaked highly sensitive information about these weapons on popular educational websites, according to Bellingcat.


Military personnel used popular learning websites such as Quizlet, Chegg Prep, and Cram to remember complex security protocols, exact locations, and other top-secret information. 


So how did Bellingcat&#x27;s Foeke Postma uncover the leaked documents? Well, a simple search on the study websites revealed various sets of flashcards.

One suspects that historians and economists will consistently agree on one irrefutable fact: nations that allow their economies to bathe in red ink are destined to fail. This failure takes many roads and differs in timing, but massive, uncontrolled national deficits eventually reduce a nation state to being a pauper, a pariah -- and pathetic.


Enter Joe Biden&#x27;s &quot;American Jobs Plan,&quot; a $2.3 trillion spending scheme that takes some Americans&#x27; most fevered fantasies and wraps them inside an &quot;infrastructure&quot; label in an effort to convince Capitol Hill that the spending is all about roads and bridges.

After receiving more than 75,000 individual complaints that it&#x27;s Alex-powered Echo devices were spying on them, Amazon has abandoned its policy that such complaints must be resolved outside the court system via secretive arbitration proceedings, and will instead allow customers to file lawsuits, according to the Wall Street Journal.


In other words, &#x27;so sue us.&#x27;







The company quietly changed its terms of service to file lawsuits, as the company already faces at least three class action suits - including one brought May 18 alleging that the company&#x27;s Echo devices were recording people without permission.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


A man in eastern China contracted what appears to be the first human case of H10N3, a type of avian influenza, according to Chinese regime officials.







The 41-year-old man, who was not named, was hospitalized in late April with H10N3 in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, located near Shanghai, according to China’s National Health Commission in a statement on its website.


The commission said that no other cases have been reported.



“This infection is an accidental cross-species transmission,” its statement said, while also claiming that “the risk of large-scale transmission is low,” according to a Chinese-to-English translation.

The Biden administration has scrapped FBI background checks for caregivers at its overpacked child migrant shelters (or as AOC no longer calls them, &#x27;concentration camps&#x27;), alarming child welfare experts who say this compromises safety, according to the Chicago Tribune.







The move comes as Biden turns to &quot;tent camps, convention centers and other huge facilities&quot; which are operated by private contractors paid by the Department of Health and Human Services. In March, the administration announced that it would open eight new emergency sites across the Southwest, which will add 15,000 new beds - doubling capacity.

In January, 2020, when the World Health Organization insisted that COVID-19 wasn&#x27;t transmissible between humans, and Dr. Anthony Fauci said that the risk to the American public from the virus was &quot;low,&quot; officials at the National Institutes of Health were scrambling to perform damage control after a controversial - and now withdrawn - study suggested that there were HIV-like &#x27;insertions&#x27; included in SARS-CoV-2.







The study, &quot;Uncanny similarity of unique inserts on the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag,&quot; posited that segments of the virus&#x27;s RNA had no relation to other coronaviruses such as SARS, and instead appeared to be closer to HIV.

You probably don’t need me to tell you that society is coming apart at the seams all around us.  If you live in a major city, you can just walk outside and watch it happen right in front of you.  Prior to 2020, social decay was steadily eating away at our society, but once the pandemic hit many of our societal problems greatly accelerated.  Even while the Federal Reserve was making sure that wealthy Wall Street investors were being taken care of well, poverty and homelessness were absolutely exploding in major cities all over the nation.  Meanwhile, an increasing number of Americans have been turning to drugs to cope with thei…</span>

Update (2002 ET): The USDA has released an important update about the Biden administration&#x27;s steps to mitigate potential supply constraints and price surges following JBS&#x27; ransomware attack. 



As noted earlier today by the White House, USDA is aware of the ransomware attack against JBS, which is affecting the company&#x27;s operations, including its facilities in the United States. USDA continues to work closely with the White House, Department of Homeland Security, JBS USA and others to monitor this situation closely and offer help and assistance to mitigate any potential supply or price issues. As part of that effort, USDA has reached out to several major meat processors in the United States to …</span>

Longtime &#x27;bond king&#x27; Bill Gross has kept a low profile since his &quot;retirement&quot; from Janus Henderson, where he worked after leaving PIMCO abruptly in 2014 in a high-profile dispute with colleagues. While he emerged earlier this year to share the results of a recent Gamestop short, Gross has been making more appearances in the tabloids than in the business press recently thanks to a legal dispute with one of his neighbors.







But in today&#x27;s FT, Gross returns with an editorial warning that the Federal Reserve and Treasury are injecting money into the economy so quickly that as the economy recovers from COVID-19, they&#x27;re risking a dangerous snap-back in markets as investors reckon with the withdrawal of …</span>

Via SchiffGold.com,


Last month, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed a bill into law that creates a commission to study the feasibility of creating a gold bullion depository in the Volunteer State.







A state bullion depository would not only create a safe place to store precious metals; it would increase the state’s financial independence. It could also facilitate the everyday use of gold and silver in financial transactions in Tennessee and set the stage to undermine the Federal Reserve’s monopoly on money.


Sen. Paul Rose (R) sponsored Senate Bill 279 (SB279) and Rep. Bud Hulsey (R-Kingsport) carried the companion bill in the House — House Bill 353 (HB353). The new law requires the Tennessee advis…</span>

President Biden has decided to maintain President Trump&#x27;s blacklisting of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, cutting it off from key American suppliers and hamstringing its smartphone business, which was, for a brief time, the global leader in sales thanks to its leading position in China, by far the world&#x27;s biggest market. Now, after developing its own proprietary operating system and initially deploying it on laptops and tablets, the company is preparing to launch a mobile version of Harmony OS for smartphones in a bid to take on Google and Apple.

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


The Washington Post has become the latest media outlet to reverse its earlier insistence that the Wuhan lab leak theory was a “debunked conspiracy theory.”







The newspaper published an article in February 2020 by Paulini Firozi labeling the explanation a “debunked conspiracy theory” but has now been forced to issue a retraction.



“Earlier versions of this story and its headline inaccurately characterized comments by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) regarding the origins of the coronavirus,” states the retraction.


“The term “debunked” and the Post’s use of “conspiracy theory” have been removed because, the…</span>

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


The mothers of several people whose names have been invoked by Black Lives Matter activists panned the group’s co-founder, Patrisse Cullors, for benefitting “off the blood” of their family members.







Cullors last week announced last week that she would be departing the organization, coming after reports disclosed her finances and real estate holdings.



“They are benefiting off the blood of our loved ones, and they won’t even talk to us,” Samaria Rice, the mother of a 12-year-old boy, Tamir Rice, who was shot by police in Cleveland, told the New York Post.

                    <span>SEC Blasted Tesla In May 2020 For Failing To Oversee Musk&#x27;s Tweets

            
In previously undisclosed documents, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, securities regulators told Tesla last year that CEO Elon Musk&#x27;s use of Twitter had twice violated a court-ordered policy requiring his tweets to be preapproved by company lawyers.







In letters sent to Tesla in 2019 and 2020, the SEC reportedly said tweets that Musk wrote about Tesla&#x27;s solar roof production volumes and its stock price hadn&#x27;t undergone the required preapproval by Tesla&#x27;s lawyers.


As a reminder, Musk had publicly mocked the SEC even after settling the previous fraud claims with the agency.







Specifically, The Wall Street Journal reports that the SEC told Tesla in May 2020 that:



the company had failed “to enforce these procedures and controls despite repeated violations by Mr. Musk.”



The letter, signed by a senior SEC official in its San Francisco office, added:



“Tesla has abdicated the duties required of it by the court’s order.”



This perhaps explains why Musk himself was quick to admit in May 2020 that &quot;no&quot;, his twitter remarks were not vetted.


Given the fact that we are just discovering these details now - at least 13 months after they occurred - as far as we can see, nothing at all has been done to either re-enforce the SEC-ordered oversight by Tesla lawyers, or to slow Musk&#x27;s roll in tweeting frequency and absurdity (cough Dogecoin cough)...



Is the SEC going to - wait for it - tell Tesla to preclear Musk&#x27;s tweets (again)?

...we can only imagine how long it will be before some actual actions are taken... or enforcements hardened over the carmaker&#x27;s incessant need to &#x27;share&#x27;.

By now, even the shoeshine boy knows that central banks are one-print trick pony farcical joke, one which is exposed not just by cryptos which have emerged as a clear alternative to fiat currencies, but by central banks themselves who are adopting their own digital currencies knowing well that the days of traditional paper money are numbered.


And yet within the giant Venn Diagram of the &quot;big farce&quot;, there is a smaller Venn Diagram, which is basically everything and anything Turkey-related, and whose farcical content is exponentially more concentrated because while central banks have become the laughing stock of the financial world in its twilight days before the upcoming grea…</span>

Amazon Sidewalk, the company&#x27;s new shared mesh network that helps devices like Amazon Echo devices, Ring Security Cams, outdoor lights, motion sensors, and Tile trackers work better around the house and beyond, will be switched on next week. Tens of millions of Americans own Amazon devices, and the experimental network will turn users into guinea pigs next week, according to ArsTechnica.


On June 8, users who don&#x27;t opt-out will be automatically enrolled in &quot;Sidewalk.&quot; The mesh network, created by Echoes, cameras, and other smart devices under the Amazon brand, will use a small amount of bandwidth and broadcast to nearby neighbors and or city streets.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


More than 100 employees at Houston Methodist Hospital filed a lawsuit against their employer for requiring all staff members to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in order to keep their jobs.







Saying the COVID-19 vaccines are experimental and they don’t want to be “guinea pigs,” the 117 employees argued in court that it’s unlawful for their employers to require them to take the shots.



“Methodist Hospital is forcing its employees to be human ‘guinea pigs’ as a condition for continued employment,” their lawsuit (pdf) states. They wrote that the hospital’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate “requires the employee to subject themselves to medical…</span>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who increasingly looks to be on his way out of power, said on Tuesday that&#x27;s he&#x27;s willing to worsen relations with the US under the Biden administration if it means preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.


&quot;An Iranian nuclear bomb is a threat for the continuation of the Zionist project and we must fight it relentlessly,&quot; he said at a ceremony on the occasion of Israel&#x27;s new Mossad chief David Barnea taking the helm. &quot;If we have to choose between friction with our great friend the U.S. and the elimination of this existential threat, the elimination of the threat will come first,&quot; Netanyahu asserted.

“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. …We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. …In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or busines…</span>

Once upon a time, not that long ago, the biggest outrage in the world of politics was the &quot;shocking&quot; revelation made possible by Edward Snowden&#x27;s exposure of the NSA&#x27;s deep state operations, that the Obama administration had a penchant for spying... on everyone, and especially its top allies such as Angela Merkel who BlackBerry was notorious breached by US spies (yes, even the ultra-partisan outlet CNN covered it &quot;Obama administration spied on German media as well as its government&quot;).


Of course, the outrage eventually died down with nothing changing - after all, the US deep state can and will spy on anyone and everyone it chooses, and it&#x27;s not like the president has any control over it, …</span>

                    <span>WHO Switches To Greek Letters To Name Most Dangerous COVID Mutants

            
In a decision that echos the WHO&#x27;s decision back in early 2020 to rename the novel coronavirus to &quot;COVID-19&quot;, the agency has decided to change the names of the most prominent mutant strains of the coronavirus to letters from the Greek alphabet.







Using letters like Alpha, Beta and Gamma (instead of B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) to refer to the variants will make it &quot;easier and more practical&quot; to discuss them with non-scientific audiences, the WHO said in a statement. COVID strains believed to be more infectious are deemed &quot;of interest&quot; and &quot;of concern&quot; by the WHO. 



&quot;While they have their advantages, these scientific names can be difficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting,&quot; the WHO …</span>

                    <span>A Margin Story: Fast Economic Growth Without Profits

            
By Joe Carson, former chief economist at Alliance Bernstein


In Q1 2021, the US economy registered double-digit annualized growth in nominal GDP, a rare occurrence. Yet, an even more rare event is that corporate operating profits did not increase in the quarter when GDP growth increased double-digits.


How can companies&#x27; operating earnings be flat when nominal growth is booming? How does the GDP measure of operating square with S&amp;P 500 firms reporting substantial gains in Q1, far exceeding analysts&#x27; estimates?

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported that nominal GDP increased at an annual rate of 11% in Q1 2021. Since the Reagan boom of the early 1980s, the US only regis…</span>

                    <span>Iran Warns Against &quot;Miscalculations&quot; As US Military Monitors Pair Of Venezuela-Bound Warships

            
In a seeming repeat of the Trump admin attempt to impose a full naval blockade on Venezuela to prevent fuel and oil imports and exports, especially involving Iranian tankers, the US military is said to be actively monitoring two Iranian naval vessels which are believed headed toward Venezuela.


Washington has reportedly warned the Maduro government against receiving the warships, which likely have elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force members aboard. The two &quot;rogue states&quot; (as the US sees them) have become increasingly close especially under the prior four Trump years as they cooperated in circumventing US sanctions, and have grown militarily more cooperative.

After Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) attempted to combat cartels through peaceful means - namely his &quot;hugs, not bullets&quot; campaign to appease criminal organizations, the notoriously violent Jalisco cartel responded by kidnapping several members of an elite police force in the state of Guanajuato, torturing them to obtain the names and addresses of other cops, and is now hunting them down and killing them at their own homes, &quot;on their days off, in front of their families,&quot; according to the Associated Press.

Australia and New Zealand have managed to keep COVID cases and deaths at a minimum thanks largely to their isolated status, which has enabled both countries to &quot;raise the drawbridge&quot;, so to speak, keeping out most foreigners since the start of the crisis.







But even with Australia&#x27;s notoriously stringent COVID-19 restrictions, a few cases have managed to slip by. In the face of the biggest cluster uncovered in months, Melbourne and the surrounding Victoria State entered their 4th lockdown last week. Though it was only supposed to last a week, that could soon change as more cases are confirmed.

While there was far more than met the eye in Biden&#x27;s $6 trillion budget (released late on Friday ahead of the &quot;long weekend&quot; as if Joe desperately hoped nobody would read it as it pissed off both conservatives as well as socialists) as discussed last week his budget proposal to Congress did reveal what Goldman has called the &quot;most important number&quot; in the budget - it calls for an increase in the deficit of $800BN over 10 years (0.3% of GDP over that period) to accommodate his “American Jobs Plan” (AJP) and “American Families Plan”(AFP). While the amount is not surprising, according to Goldman this is the first time the White House has formally shown the net effect of their proposals over the ten-year period Congress will…</span>

Three weeks before China admitted that a mysterious virus was circulating in the city of Wuhan, a 61-year-old woman who lived about a mile from several bat research facility was known as &quot;Patient Su&quot; at a local hospital, according to the Daily Mail.


Her identity was accidentally revealed after a leading Chinese official sent a screen-grab to a medical journal which partially revealed personal information, including the fact that she was admitted to the Rongjun Hospital in Wuhan, and &quot;almost certainly lived in the Kaile Guiyan community on Zhuodaoquan Street, about 600 metres from the medical centre.&quot;

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is tasked with assessing all commercial or pedestrian traffic entering the United States by airplane, overland vehicle, ship or on foot. However, in Mexico, about 10 different organizations are tasked with implementing customs clearance, issuing permits and certificates of imports/exports and protecting the border, including the Mexican army, the Guardia Nacional and the federal Tax Administration Service (SAT).

Brace for more pessimistic news about the global semiconductor shortage...


Intel is now going on the record and doubling down on statements that its CEO made on 60 Minutes earlier this year, stating that it could take &quot;several years&quot; for the current supply shortage of semiconductors to be resolved. 


CEO Pat Gelsinger said that the pandemic-inspired &quot;work from home&quot; trend caused a &quot;cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors&quot;, according to Reuters. 


&quot;But while the industry has taken steps to address near term constraints it could still take a couple of years for the ecosystem to address shortages of foundry capacity, substrates and components,&quot; Gelsinger commented.

Authored by Isabel van Brugen via The Epoch Times,


Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the lead Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Sunday said it was “more likely than not” that COVID-19 originated from a lab accident, calling it the “worst cover-up in human history.”



“I do think it’s more likely than not it emerged out of the lab, most likely accidentally,” McCaul said during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.”


“Let me say, this is the worst cover-up in human history that we’ve seen resulting in 3.5 million deaths, creating economic devastation around the globe.”

The introduction of COVID status certificates is creating a two-tier society whereby vaxxed people enjoy their full rights and other perks, and non-vaxxed are heavily penalized.  


The latest example is in Florida, where a concert promoter for a future rock show this summer in Tampa Bay charges $18 per ticket for vaxxed fans and $999.99 for non-vaxxed fans, according to Tampa ABC affiliate WFTS.

                    <span>Memorial Day: Remember Political Lies That Caused Soldiers To Die

            
Authored by James Bovard via JimBovard.com,


On Memorial Day, the media do their usual sacralizing of war. Instead, it should be a day for the ritualized scourging of politicians.


During the last 70 years, their lies have resulted in the unnecessary deaths of almost 100,000 American soldiers and millions of foreigners. And yet, people still get teary-eyed when politicians take the stage to talk about their devotion to the troops.







On Memorial Day 2011, for instance, the Washington Post included numerous touching photographs of graves, recent widows or fatherless kids by the headstones, and stories of the troops’ sacrifices. The Post buried a short article in the middle of the A-Section (squee…</span>

                    <span>Michael Flynn Says Myanmar-Style Military Coup &#x27;Should Happen&#x27; In United States

            
Former Trump National Security Adviser Micheal Flynn made an off-the-cuff statement over the weekend that a Myanmar-like military coup not only could happen, but &quot;should happen&quot; in the US.







Speaking at the Dallas &quot;For God &amp; Country Patriot Roundup,&quot; branded by Business Insider and MarketWatch as a &quot;QAnon conference&quot; (because a quilt with a &quot;Q&quot; on it was auctioned off at the event), Flynn was asked during a Q&amp;A session &quot;I want to know why what happened in Myanmar can’t happen here?&quot;


To which Flynn - who spent 33 years as an Army intelligence officer - replied: &quot;No reason. I mean, it should happen.&quot;

After it was revealed that the FBI pressured Flynn into pleading guilty amid threat of going after his son, leading the DOJ to drop its case against him (which a judge finally closed eight months later), Flynn has become an icon among former President Trump&#x27;s most ardent supporters.


According to the New York Times, &quot;He was one of the most extreme voices in Mr. Trump’s 77-day push to overturn the election,&quot; and suggested using the military to rerun the vote in key battleground states - which then-President Trump could have imposed martial law to enact.


&quot;People out there talk about martial law like it’s something that we’ve never done,&quot; Flynn told Newsmax several months ago, noting that the military had taken over for civilian authorities dozens of times in US history.

The Elephant in the Room


Since we now know the extreme monetary policy implemented by the Americans is actually less extreme when compared to the Japanese, the Europeans, the Chinese, the Canadians and others, then there must be something else happening to create all of this (nonsensical) drama about the US Dollar being on the verge of collapsing.


And this is where the reflation trade comes into play. Monetary theorists have always proclaimed that if you produce excessive stimulus via interest rate cuts, balance sheet expansion and especially when combined with excessive stimulus, then inflation is going t…</span>

                    <span>China Orders First Lockdown Since January As Indian Mutant Discovered In Guangzhou

            
India&#x27;s second coronavirus wave finally crested during the month of May as the 7-day average declined steadily over the course of the month, while deaths remained stubbornly high until the second half. But even more than the numbers, the spread of a mutated COVID strain first discovered in India, a strain tagged with the handle B.1.617, has raised alarm as it spread around the world.







And now China is reacting to evidence of a recent cluster of cases caused by the Indian variant to further tighten China&#x27;s border between India and their mutual neighbors.

Moscow had some stinging words for Washington which were also hilariously ironic on Monday, as both Putin and Biden look ahead to their in-person summit set for June 16 in Geneva. Warning of &quot;uncomfortable&quot; signals to come, the Kremlin indicated that high on the agenda would be a range of human rights and free speech issues in the United States, particularly the &quot;persecution&quot; of those behind the January 6 Capitol riot by the Biden administration. 


The words appear Moscow&#x27;s ultimate trolling response to Biden remarks on Sunday wherein he vowed to confront Putin on egregious human rights abuses: &quot;Of course, we will be ready to discuss everything, including problems that exist in th…</span>

Local newspaper Yomiuri reveals Japanese authorities are mulling over expanding eligibility criteria, including a negative COVID-19 test or vaccination history, for fans before entering the Tokyo Olympics this summer. Once inside, spectators might be forbidden from eating, drinking, and cheering. 


Yomiuri said the government is considering that all spectators be required to show a negative COVID test within a week before attending the event that is set to run between July 23 and Aug. 8. 







Reuters quoted the government&#x27;s top spokesman Katsunobu Kato, who told reporters that he&#x27;s unaware of any decision on eligibility criteria.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Below is my column in the Hill newspaper on the announcement that the University of California will now join the “test-blind” movement and end the use of the SAT and ACT in its admissions decisions. Some have called for the change to increase diversity in the schools, particularly after California voters refused to change the long ban on affirmative action in education under state law.

Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has brought up a very interesting point regarding China&#x27;s unwillingness to share evidence with western investigators looking into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.


During a Sunday appearance on CBS News &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; Gottlieb noted that CCP scientists would have taken blood samples from three lab workers who were hospitalized with COVID-like symptoms in Dec. 2019 (one of whom&#x27;s wife likely died of the disease).







When asked if he believes whether the Chinese know where the pandemic came from, Gottlieb replied: &quot;They would know the answer to the question because they would have blood samples from the workers in that lab.&quot;…</span>

Different Types of Competition


With today being the US Memorial Day holiday to commemorate its fallen combat soldiers, it’s likely to be a quiet start to the week for markets. However, the US holiday provides a platform for some sober reflection on more contemporary forms of competition


First, a former PBOC official says the rapid rise in CNY against USD probably won’t last, and that the Chinese currency is “overbought”. That looks a further jaw-boning attempt to shift market expectations away from the idea that Beijing is going to allow CNY to keep appreciating.

The owner of a Mendocino, California restaurant is penalizing customers who wear masks inside, according to NBC Bay Area.



&quot;$5 FEE ADDED TO ORDERS PLACED WHILE WEARING A FACE MASK,&quot; reads signs posted in the windows and at the register of Fiddleheads Cafe.



Fiddleheads Cafe in Mendocino not only discourages wearing masks but also charges a penalty. (May 28, 2021)


The fine print adds that anyone overheard bragging about having been vaccinated will be hit with another $5 charge.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


Over the weekend Senator Rand Paul and former CIA director and secretary of state Mike Pompeo both warned that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is still up and running, and that evidence points to involvement with the Chinese military in bioweapons research.







Appearing on Fox News, Paul told Jeanine Pirro that he is worried US funding is still being used by the lab to conduct biological warfare experiments.



“I’m very worried that this stuff still goes on and that the U.S. government’s been funding it,” Paul said, adding “We’ve got a lot of evidence pointing to this lab now,” as the origin of the virus outbreak.

North Korea has blasted what it&#x27;s calling a &quot;hostile policy&quot; in the wake of the Biden White House lifting restrictions on South Korea&#x27;s ballistic missile program, which is now authorized to develop missiles capable of traveling beyond prior limitations. 


During a May 21 US-South Korea summit the US side announced Seoul is now free to pursue missiles with unlimited ranges, but the statement out of a Pyongyang official said this will inevitably lead to an &quot;acute and instable situation&quot;, according to the Associated Press. Previously the US imposed a limit of a 500 mile range (800km) on the south&#x27;s missiles on concerns of a regional arms race.

Often, we forget that Memorial Day  is a day not for merchandise sales and or the unofficial start of Summer.







But rather it is a day set aside to honor those brave men and women who have fallen in the performance of their military duties while serving in the United States armed forces. 


On this solemn day there will be cemeteries all across the nation where loved ones will pay their humble respects and quiet tribute to a father, mother, sister, or brother.

With at least 24 GOP-led states set to end federal unemployment assistance before they&#x27;re set to expire on Sept. 6, million of Americans are going to need to dust off those resumes and start helping reduce the massive job shortage after being paid to stay home for over a year.







The benefits set to lapse include not only the additional $300 weekly federal supplement, but programs for gig workers and others who typically don&#x27;t qualify for aid &quot;(Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, or PUA) and for the long-term unemployed (Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, or PEUC) in most cases,&quot; according to CNBC, which has provided this handy guide to states set to end benefits, and when:

Authored by Mark Hendrickson via The Mises Institute,


To most people, “inflation” signifies widespread rising prices. Economists have long argued, as a matter of technical accuracy, that “inflation” denotes an increasing money supply. Frankly, though, most people don’t care what happens to the supply of money, but they care a lot about the prices they pay, so I’ll focus primarily on the numerous rapidly rising prices Americans are paying today.







Following are several examples of the current inflation:

Belgium has recalled its ambassador to South Korea after his wife allegedly assaulted two employees of a shop in Seoul, an incident that elicited widespread public anger in South Korea.


According to the AP, the Belgian Embassy said Foreign Affairs Minister Sophie Wilmès had decided that it was in the best interest of bilateral relations to terminate Ambassador Peter Lescouhier&#x27;s tenure as Belgium&#x27;s ambassador to Seoul, a position he has held for three years.

                    <span>Veterans Speak About Memorial Day: &quot;It&#x27;s Not About Us&quot;

            
Authored by Patricia Tolson via The Epoch Times,


On Monday, May 31, Americans from sea to shining sea will observe Memorial Day. However, veterans are quick to remind you: “It’s not about us.”



“Monday is not about us,” Sergeant J.O. Batten, Commander of VFW Post 8713 in Brooksville, Florida told The Epoch Times.


“It’s about the men on that wall out there. A lot of people don’t realize that.”



Batten, a United States Marine, served in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969.







“The wall” is a granite monument, which stands guard at the front door of VFW. It bears the names of a group of men known as “The Brooksville Eight,” men who were killed in action during the Vietnam War.


They are:

By Vishwanath Tirupattur, global head of Quantitative Research at Morgan Stanley


The title of our recently published mid-year outlook – Now the Hard Part – captures the conundrum market participants face: early-cycle timing, mid-cycle conditions and late-cycle valuations.







It is unusual to see this confluence, especially because it was only a little over a year ago that global risk markets were reeling and recording cyclical lows. Thus, despite our economists&#x27; call for strong global economic growth supported by the largest fiscal stimulus, the largest monetary easing and the highest consumer savings rates in post-war history, the investment recommendations from our strategists have a more subdued tone…</span>

Authored by Ethan Yang via The American Institute for Economic Research,


The internet is having a field day over a seemingly trivial mishap involving actor and wrestler John Cena, who apologized for calling the island nation of Taiwan a country. That is a massive point of issue for the Chinese Communist Party as they continue to claim that Taiwan is part of China. NBC News provides the context by reporting,



“In an interview to Taiwanese broadcaster TVBS earlier this month, Cena sparked controversy while promoting the ninth installment of the Fast &amp; Furious franchise when he said, “Taiwan is the first country to watch Fast and Furious 9.”



Cena later issued an apology by stating,

Silicon Valley elites are obsessed with immortality. They&#x27;re pouring investments into biohacking technologies on their quest for living forever. We don&#x27;t want to spoil their fun, but sometimes we have to, as a new study suggests the upper limit of human mortality is 150 years old. 


Researchers of Gero, a Singapore-based biotech company in collaboration with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York, published new research in the journal of Nature portfolio, showing results between aging and the loss of the ability to recover from stresses. They gathered iPhone and medical data from volunteers in the US and UK to calculate the maximum age of humans.

Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,


The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday walked back comments made by the agency’s chief, who suggested earlier in the day that the federal government was “taking a very close look” at the idea of requiring vaccine passports to enter or leave the United States.



“Looking ahead to summer, Europe and other countries are going to open up. Could we see vaccine passports to travel internationally either into or out of the U.S.?” an ABC “Good Morning America” host asked Alejandro Mayorkas, head of the DHS.


“We’re taking a very close look at that,” Mayorkas responded.

By Kim Link-Wills of American Shipper


A search is ongoing for three crew members reported missing from a roll-on/roll-off (ro/ro) vessel that sank off the coast of Japan early Friday morning.  The MV Byakko sank at about 2:40 a.m. local time after colliding with the chemical tanker Ulsan Pioneer just before midnight in the Seto Inland Sea, Reuters reported. The Byakko reportedly sank about 2.5 miles off the coast of Imabari.


Nine of the Byakko’s 12 crew members were said to have been rescued by the Japanese coast guard and nearby ships.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Two GOP lawmakers this week launched a campaign calling on whistleblowers in the military to come forward with their experiences in training programs that promote critical race theory or “diversity, equity, and inclusion.”



“We won’t let our military fall to woke ideology,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), a former Navy SEAL, wrote in a tweet on Friday while linking to a website where informants can submit their accounts.


“With written permission, we will anonymously publish egregious complaints on social media and tell the country what’s happening in our military.”

It&#x27;s the end of an era for Israeli politics as embattled prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country&#x27;s longest serving leader, is facing a shocking ouster after the head of a small hard-line party on Sunday said he would try to form a unity government with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s opponents, effectively ending Bibi&#x27;s 12-year rule.


In a nationwide address, Yamina party leader and Netanyahu&#x27;s former defense minister, Naftali Bennett said he had decided to join forces with the country&#x27;s opposition leader, Yair Lapid in a “unity government&quot; whose &quot;unified&quot; goal has long been removing Netanyahu from office.

Authored by Diane Diamond, op-ed via The Epoch Times,


Last June, eight guys in Brooklyn put their heads together, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, and came up with a scheme to steal strangers’ identities and take what didn’t belong to them.


Just a couple months before that—in the earliest days of the COVID-19 scare—Congress passed a $2.2 trillion bill called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. The money was supposed to go to the millions of isolated Americans who had their paychecks interrupted during the pandemic.


The mooks in Brooklyn had other plans.

Rising wealth in China and the number of millionaires and the middle class is set to increase through the midpoint of this decade as the country grows more affluent and smarter. 


HSBC Holdings Plc&#x27;s new report &quot;The rising wealth of China; Millionaires and the middle class lead the way&quot; predicts a world where millionaires in the country are set to double in the next five years, and the middle class will increase by nearly half. 


From an asset manager&#x27;s point of view, China could be the next hot spot for new clients mainly because the report shows 2 million high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), those with the equivalent of at least $1.55 million in investable assets, are set to more than double …</span>

Authored by Eva Fu via The Epoch Times,


More than 200 House Republicans are putting pressure on their Democrat counterparts to get down to the COVID-19 origins and hold the Chinese regime accountable for the pandemic coverup.



“We request that you instruct the appropriate Democrat committee chairs to immediately join Republican calls to hold the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) accountable for its role in causing the global COVID-19 pandemic,” stated a May 28 letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

A recent report by the United Nations Security Council found that a Turkish-made autonomous drone may have &quot;hunted down and remotely engaged&quot; enemy soldiers loyal to the Libyan General Khalifa Haftar. This bombshell report could be one of the first recorded instances where a terminator-style AI drone engaged and destroyed human targets on its own initiative. 



&quot;Logistics convoys and retreating Haftar Affiliated Forces (HAF) were subsequently hunted down and remotely engaged by the unmanned combat aerial vehicles or the lethal autonomous weapons systems such as the STM Kargu-2 and other loitering munitions,&quot; the UN report reveals.

Authored by Mike Shedlock via MishTalk.com,


The gold commitment of traders report is bullish. Let&#x27;s start with a primer of what the COT report shows.







What is the COT Report?


COT reports show the positioning of commodity futures. There is a COT report for every commodity (gold, silver, lean hogs, live cattle, sugar, corn, the S&amp;P 500, US Treasuries, etc.).


The reports are released every Friday but reflect futures positions as of the previous Tuesday.


In the futures world, the net position is always zero. For every long there is a short.


The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CTFC produces two sets of reports described below.

                    <span>Tesla Facing &quot;Further Fallout&quot; In China As Local Governments Mull &quot;Security Risks&quot; Of Vehicles

            
The rocky road between Tesla and the Chinese Communist Party looks like it is continuing.


The automaker is facing &quot;further fallout&quot; in China as some local governments are reviewing Tesla vehicle ownership among their staff, citing the vehicles posing potential security risks, according to Bloomberg. 


Government bodies have been asked to check and report on employees who own Teslas in Zhejiang and Guangxi. Employees are being &quot;forbidden&quot; from driving into certain official areas, due to supposed security risks, the report notes. 


Other official Chinese bodies are following suit. The China Meteorological Administration, for example, has already told its employees not to b…</span>

Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,


That the era of stability has ended and a new era of increasingly chaotic volatility has begun is not on anyone&#x27;s radar as a possibility.


The standard debate about the future of the economy is: which will we get, high inflation or a deflationary collapse of defaults and asset bubbles popping?


The debate goes round and round in widening circles of complexity as analysts delve into every nuance of the debate.


A recent conversation with my friend A.T. raised a third possibility few seem to consider: increasingly chaotic volatility will be the new normal, as wild swings between inflation and deflation will increase in amplitude and feroci…</span>

Get ready for $5 per gallon gasoline - especially if you live in California.


At least, that was the contention of a new WSJ op-ed that claims higher taxes and environmental regulations are both driving up the price of gas. 


Author Allysia Finley notes that the average cost at the pump in California is now $4.18 a gallon, pointing out that in 2017, Democrats in the state&#x27;s legislature raised a tax on each gallon by 20.8 cents over three years. 


California drivers are now paying an astonishing average of 63 cents a gallon in state and local taxes, compared an average of 36.8 cents elsewhere in the country. 


The reasoning for the price hike was to repair the state&#x27;s infrastructure, but …</span>

Authored by John Rubino via DollarCollapse.com,


The “Everything Bubble” has jumped from hyperbole to literal truth in just a couple of years, as more and more assets enter “crazy expensive/extremely reckless” territory. The latest addition to the list is collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), which are created when a bank lends money to a less-than-creditworthy company and then bundles that loan with a bunch of similar loans into bonds for sale to yield-starved pension funds and bond funds.


There’s a legitimate place in the market for this kind of security, as long as everyone understands the risks. But in financial bubbles, banks’ insatiable hunger for fees combines with bond buyers’ desperate need for income to cloud everyone’s jud…</span>

Wholesaling real estate is the process of finding a deeply discounted home and passing it along to an end investor. Bearing fast cash, wholesalers are flooding low-income neighborhoods, seeking distressed homeowners who want to sell quickly. Record low mortgage rates, low housing inventory, and a real estate frenzy have increased the amount of wholesaling conducted nationwide since the pandemic as many were lured in by YouTube tutorials. 


The entire strategy behind wholesaling is finding a discounted property, get it under contract, and then flip it to an interested buyer for a quick profit. Bloomberg reports some wholesalers are using strong-arm tactics and misinformation to force sales. Wholesaling…</span>

Davos really do think they are too clever by half. Despite prognostications to the contrary, negotiations with Iran over a new JCPOA are nearing completion which Biden/Obama will sign off on after putting up a bit more token resistance to lifting sanctions.


Why do I say this? Nordstream 2.


Biden backed down on Nordstream 2 and, at The Davos Crowd’s insistence, he will back down on the JCPOA.







Davos needs cheap energy into Europe. That’s ultimately what the JCPOA was all about. The basic framework for the deal is still there. While the U.S. will kick and scream a bit about sanctions relief, Iran will be back into the oil market and make it possible for Europe to on…</span>

                    <span>US Military Plans To Harvest Solar Energy In Space, Beam It To Earth

            
The US Air Force (USAF) is experimenting with the idea to harvest space solar power that will be beamed back to Earth as usable energy. 


The US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) shared a video on YouTube describing how the solar power satellite Arachne would work. 







AFRL Director Brig. Gen. Heather Pringle, quoted by Breaking Defense, said the critical design review of Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research Project (SSPIDR) would be conducted this summer. 


SSPIDR aims to use an Arachne satellite that would convert energy generated from the sun to radio frequency and beam it down to a land-based antenna. Once the radio frequency hits the antenna, it will be converted to useable power. 


If SSPIDR is successful, it could one day give the US military a great advantage on the modern battlefield and an unlimited source of energy for forward operating bases. This will also allow for bases to power future weapons, such as lasers and rail guns. 


At the moment, the military requires massive supply chains and convoys to receive not just energy power generation equipment but also fuel to power generators at remote bases. 


&quot;Ensuring that a forward operating base maintains reliable power is one of the most dangerous parts of military ground operations. Convoys and supply lines are a major target for adversaries,&quot; the narrator of a new AFRL video said. 





Well, this appears to be one way the military is attempting to &quot;go green.&quot;

Ransomware has seeped into the mainstream consciousness thanks to the recent shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline. Crippled by a ransomware attack, Colonial ended up paying a $4.4 million ransom in bitcoins to free itself from its attackers. In the meantime, the U.S. Eastern Seaboard suffered from gasoline shortages.







What is ransomware? It is malicious software that takes control of a computer, say, by encrypting files or threatening to publicly expose data. The ransomware operator only releases that control after receiving a ransom payment, usually Bitcoin but sometimes Monero.

Capping off a week wherein both Belarus and its powerful ally Russia are once again in a diplomatic and sanctions battle with the EU, this time involving flight paths being blocked following last Sunday&#x27;s Ryanair forced diversion incident, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko in Sochi.


Putin reportedly welcomed Lukashenko to the Friday meeting with the remarks: &quot;Thank you for coming here, as we agreed even before the current outburst of emotions,&quot; He emphasized further, &quot;Yes, it is an outburst of emotions,&quot; before saying, &quot;But we have topics to discuss without these developments.&quot;

Market Review &amp; Update


Finally, after a week of false starts, the “buy signals” kicked in, and the markets mustered a rally. As we stated last week:



“With markets deeply oversold on a short-term basis and with signals at levels that generally precede short-term rallies, the rally on Thursday and Friday was not unexpected. Notably, the S&amp;P 500 held support at the 50-dma and rallied back into the previous trading range. 


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq triggered its short-term “buy signal,” which will likely provide some relative outperformance over the S&amp;P 500. It will be important for the Nasdaq to hold above the 50-dma into next week“

For the better part of the past decade, Wall Street traders would end their week with at least a casual glance at JPMorgan&#x27;s closely-followed cross-asset report written every week by the bank&#x27;s top x-asset strategist, John Normand. But not any more: as Normand wrote in his May 21 note published last Friday, &quot;this is my last research note and video, as I am moving on after 24 years.&quot; In his note, Normand discusses lessons &quot;learned in over two decades with JPM Research, covering cross-asset strategy/asset allocation, Currencies, Commodities and Fixed Income&quot; a period &quot;which covers four business cycles, three US/global recessions and four financial crises (that didn&#x27;t cause US recessions), plus hundreds o…</span>

This judicial ruling about the raging debates over group-based benefits vividly highlights the social, political and culture divisions driving U.S. politics...







A federal appellate court on Thursday invalidated the racial and gender preferences in President Biden&#x27;s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act as unconstitutional. The Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit of Appeals ruled that provisions of that law, designed to grant preferences to minority-owned small-restaurant owners for COVID relief, violate the 14th Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of equal protection under the law:

The 80 year old Brockman is being accused of failing to report $2 billion in income and using a foreign company to buy secondary debt in his own software firm at a deep discount.

Authored by John Tamny via The American Institute for Economic Research,


Let’s travel back in time to March of 2020, when predictions of mass death related to the new coronavirus started to gain currency. One study, conducted by Imperial College’s Neil Ferguson, indicated that U.S. deaths alone would exceed 2 million. 


The above number is often used, even by conservatives and libertarians, as justification for the initial lockdowns.


“We knew so little” is the excuse, and with so many deaths expected, can anyone blame local, state, and national politicians for panicking? 







The answer is a resounding yes.  


To see why, imagine if Ferguson had predicted 30 million American deaths. Imagine the fear among the Amer…</span>

                    <span>EPA Orders Shutdown Of St. Croix Refinery After Oil &quot;Rains Down&quot; On The Island

            
It was literally raining oil in St. Croix a couple weeks ago - and not in the good &quot;newly discovered oil&quot;-type way most people know from movies and TV.


The oil falling from the sky was the result of a &quot;flare incident&quot; that took place Limetree Bay refinery; the incident shot oil up into the sky and it was carried west by the wind before raining down on parts of the island, according to CNN. 


As a result of the incident, the US Environmental Protection Agency ordered an emergency, 60-day shutdown of the plant, citing an &quot;imminent risk&quot; to public health, the report says. The incident sent sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide into the air. 58 year old resident Dyline Thomas said: &quot;The smell wa…</span>

Almost three months after markets stumbled when after China’s top banking regulator said he’s &quot;very worried&quot; about risks emerging from bubbles in global financial markets (and China&#x27;s property sector) sparking concerns about further tightening in the world’s second-biggest economy and slamming risk assets, China has done it again and on Saturday Liang Tao, vice chairman of China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said at the International Finance Forum in Beijing that recent interest rate hikes by emerging economies could lead to a bursting of global financial asset bubbles which have been made even bigger by unprecedented pandemic easing measures by developed countries (i.e., Biden&#x27;s trillions).

In Virginia, Loudoun County Public Schools officials were warned Friday to revoke their suspension of a teacher for declining to use students’ preferred pronouns or face further legal action.

A north Missouri businessman who was involved in the largest organic fraud scheme in American history has been sentenced to probation and fined. According to KTTN, federal prosecutors in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sentenced Steven Whiteside of Chilicothe to three years probation and a fine of 45-thousand dollars.







Two other Northwest Missouri men were sentenced to federal prison for their roles in the 142-million dollar grain fraud scheme, which federal prosecutors describe as the “Field of Schemes.”

Change the incentives, and the outcomes change.


Ecologist Howard Odum provided a profound insight into human expansion, stagnation and collapse. He argued that humans are wired to maximize power output (i.e., consumption) rather than maximize efficiency.


In other words, humans are wired to strip the tree of every ripe fruit and throw a party, have more children and use the surplus food to feed an army of conquest. Efficient use of resources is simply not part of what I term Wetware 1.0, the set of tools that was selected and optimized over the past 200,000 years for small hunter-gatherer tribes roaming an apparently near-infinite worl…</span>

                    <span>China Successfully Launches Cargo Rocket With Supplies For New Space Station

            
China launched an automated cargo rocket hauling supplies for the country&#x27;s new space station late Saturday from the tropical island of Hainan in the South China Sea. 


A Long March-7 Y3 rocket carrying the Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft blasted off at 8:55 pm local time from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, state-run media Global Times reported.

— China Xinhua News (@XHNews) May 29, 2021


The Tianzhou spacecraft is tasked with refueling the Tianhe space station core cabin for maintenance in orbit and also provides living necessities for future crewed missions at the space station. 







The Chinese space agency expects 11 launches through the end of this year to deliver two more modules for the Tiangong Space Station, additional supplies, and a three-member crew. Today&#x27;s launch marks the second within a month. 







Apart from launch and eventual docking at the new space station, the rocket itself is set to fall back to Earth in an uncontrolled manner. Well, that&#x27;s at least what happened earlier this month after the launch. There was no statement from Beijing about reentry plans for the rocket. 


Beijing isn&#x27;t part of the International Space Station (ISS), primarily due to the U.S. The ISS has been in low Earth orbit for a little more than 22 years and could reach its lifespan by the end of this decade. Russia has already announced it would be withdrawing from the ISS to build its own.

“Whenever I hear numbers like this, I look back to my childhood growing up in Hungary, where…[the] value of money meant nothing. I’m very worried this is an unstoppable situation because the longer the Fed waits, the more they will have to raise rates. So, we’re basically painting ourselves into a box, and I don’t see how we’re going to get out of it.”

A new grading policy, put forth by the Baltimore City School Board, Tuesday, will allow students who are struggling and failing classes to move up to the next grade level due to the virus pandemic, according to local news Fox 45. 


Instead of holding back students, Baltimore City Public School System&#x27;s (BCPSS) new grading policy will push up struggling students who failed classes during the pandemic and have their educational status tested during the fall semester to determine what skills they missed during virtual learning classes. 







Chief Academic Officer Joan Dabrowski said the new policy is intended to &quot;avoid the punitive approach of failing students.&quot;

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


Last year, we discussed the controversy over the acting Northwestern Law Dean declaring publicly to “I am James Speta and I am a racist.”


He was followed by Emily Mullin, executive director of major gifts, who announced, “I am a racist and a gatekeeper of white supremacy. I will work to be better.” 


The public confessions reflect the view that all white people are racist due to their race and privilege — a view contested by some as itself a form of racial intolerance or bias.


Now one of Brandeis’ Assistant Deans, Kate Slater, has triggered a similar controversy after declaring “all white people are racists.”

According to JPMorgan&#x27;s Daniel Silver, as of this moment some 23 - all republican - states have announced at least some form of early reduction in pandemic-related unemployment insurance benefits ahead of the September expiration at the federal level. These programs, he suggests, are likely limiting labor supply, generating a potential economic argument for ending these programs early.


A glance at the following chart - which shows the number of US job opening vs the number of Americans who remain on some form of Pandemic unemployment benefit, would suggest that Silver is right.

Authored by Bryce Coward via Knowledge Leaders Capital blog,


The US dollar is on the verge of breaking down to the lowest level since 2014. 







This is not all that surprising. After all, the US money supply continues to grow at a rapid pace relative to other countries and quantitative easing is likely to continue at full pace through the end of 2021. Meanwhile, other countries like the UK, Canada and others are already telegraphing rate hikes. Not only that, but the US budget deficit as a percent of GDP – which has a tight correlation with the level of the US dollar index – is set to explode through 2022 and beyond. The ballooning budget deficit suggests a level of 70 or 80 on the US dollar index ov…</span>

Technical problems onboard a massive crude tanker Friday led to the shutdown of Turkey&#x27;s Bosphorus Strait. 


The vessel veered off course in the Bosphorus Strait, a narrow waterway that divides the city of Istanbul and connects the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.







The crude oil tanker RAVA disrupted vessel activity for three hours Friday as tugboats had to intervene and prevented the vessel from plowing into the shoreline of Istanbul&#x27;s Yenikoy district. The entire operation took eight tugs and five other vessels. The straight was reopened later in the day.

Misinformation, i.e., wrong claims innocently made, and disinformation, i.e., wrong claims willfully made, have long consorted to create propaganda, a distorted worldview designed to achieve some political goal.







The lines between those lies have so blurred that only a neologistic portmanteau, dismisinfoganda, fully captures recent reality.

Democrat lawmakers in particular have long pushed for massively increased federal aid for public housing across the country following a decades-long decline amid a perpetual funding crisis that&#x27;s left large mid-20th century urban housing complexes derelict and crumbling.


Nowhere has the crisis been felt more than (as expected) New York City, where most of the some 325 housing projects owned by New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) are dilapidated to the point of becoming uninhabitable, for years if not decades facing interminable problems like mold and rats, water leaks and damaged roots, as well as no heat, elevators going out, and lead paint hazards.

One of the fringe benefits of Washington’s stimulus program has been inflated stock portfolios.  This has delivered a great boon for certain state governments.  In Connecticut, for example, a state that taxes capital gains as regular income, this year’s budget surplus is projected to be $470 million.


That’s quite an achievement.  Especially when you consider the state’s rainy-day fund will hit an all-time high of $4.5 billion.  Federal coronavirus stimulus is also bringing $6 billion into the state.


Yet for the greedy fellows in the Connecticut state legislature the budget surplus is not nearly enough.  They want to soak the rich for the noble purpose of helping people.  Lawmakers are proposin…</span>

Biden&#x27;s nominee for assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, Christopher Maier, if confirmed is sure to get the attention of Beijing given his words this week to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Taiwan. The man who is also head of the Department of Defense&#x27;s Defeat-ISIS Task Force urged Congressional leaders in a Thursday briefing to establish a program for US special forces to train local troops in Taiwan toward deterring a possible &quot;Chinese invasion&quot;.


As the official tapped to oversee all US special forces he&#x27;s pushing an irregular warfare Vietnam-style preparedness scenario in Taiwan, which China claims as its own. &quot;I do think that is…</span>

What if I told you about a business with strong network effects and 200x YoY revenue growth that was preparing to offer a 25% dividend and implement a permanent share buyback program? Is that something you might be interested in?


That’s pretty much Ethereum. It’s one of the most fascinating and compelling assets in the world, but its story is obfuscated by complexity and the specter of crypto.

NASA&#x27;s Curiosity rover captured a stunning snapshot of what appears to be a cloudy day in the Arizona desert, but this picture is actually a cloudy day on Mars. 







NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA JPL) released multiple images documenting cloudy days in the thin, dry atmosphere of the Red Planet. 


&quot;Clouds are typically found at the planet&#x27;s equator in the coldest time of year, when Mars is the farthest from the Sun in its oval-shaped orbit. But one full Martian year ago – two Earth years – scientists noticed clouds forming over NASA&#x27;s Curiosity rover earlier than expected,&quot; NASA JPL&#x27;s press release read. 


Curiosity has taken about 21 photographs of the strange Martian clouds over Gale Crater.

Authored by Mike Shedlock via MishTalk.com,


Lifetime real earnings of the median male worker declined by 10% from those who entered the US labor market in 1967 to those in 1983, or roughly a loss of $136,000.







A study on Lifetime Earnings in the United States over Six Decades is worth a close look.


The study shows the United States shows a &quot;wage stagnation of average earnings and a rise in income inequality since the 1970s.&quot; The charts are based on US Social Security Administration (SSA) records over 57 years.


The charts are more than a bit confusing unless one carefully dives into the details.

Evanston, Illinois made headlines earlier this year by becoming the first city in the US to authorize &quot;reparations&quot; in the form of payments to compensate Black Americans for abuses done to family members. The Chicago suburb&#x27; City Council voted back in March to distribute $400K to eligible black households, with each qualifying family receiving up to $25K for homeownership and or improvement grants, as well as mortgage assistance.


But while proponents on the left praised the move as unprecedented, it turns out that those who designed the proposal were careful to ensure the word &quot;reparations&quot; was nowhere near it. In fact, a lengthy Bloomberg piece telling the story of how the proposal came to be s…</span>

US embassies and consulates across the globe this week flew Black Lives Matter (BLM) flags after being authorized and encouraged to do so for the first time ever in a memo by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. It&#x27;s now expected to be a regular practice, particularly in instances of race-related events or memorials.


Just ahead of the May 25 one-year anniversary of George Floyd&#x27;s death, a State Department memo was sent to all diplomatic staff worldwide saying that it &quot;supports the use of the term &#x27;Black Lives Matter&#x27; in messaging content&quot;.

Authored by Brandon Smith via Alt-Market.us,


What kind of abysmal social and economic conditions would make at least five separate counties of US voters want to flee a state to join the borders of another state? Well, all it takes is a cult of insane Marxists running the entire state into the ground from the safety of their metropolitan communes while demanding that people submit their undying fealty to the draconian medical mandates of an elitist minority. Yeah, things have to get pretty bad to inspire so many people into leaving and taking half the state with them.

The Daily Caller News Foundation and one of its reporters, Thomas Catenacci, is suing Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) over her decision to only grant interviews to &#x27;black or brown journalists.&#x27;







The lawsuit, filed by Daily Caller and Judicial Watch in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that Lightfoot&#x27;s denial violates the plaintiffs&#x27; First Amendment rights, as well as Catenacci&#x27;s right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has just quietly given American companies the green light to to do whatever it takes to &quot;incentivize&quot; American workers to accept the coronavirus vaccine.







As vaccinations continue to slow, and states beef up incentives including lotteries and cash prizes to any adults who agree to get vaccinated who haven&#x27;t already, the EEOC has just issued some long-awaited guidance on how far companies can go in pushing workers to be vaccinated. Some companies, including Delta Air Lines, have said they won&#x27;t hire anyone who hasn&#x27;t already been vaccinated.

After years of reports of Amazon warehouse employees being forced to urinate in bottles, forego medical care, and work through injuries - causing hundreds to launch petitions and revolt, the online retail giant has come up with a solution...







...a special sensory deprivation booth that allows stressed out employees to collect themselves before heading back out to the floor.



Known simply as the “ZenBooth,” the new apparatus, according to a video released by the company on Wednesday, is an “interactive kiosk where you can navigate through a library of mental health and mindful practices to recharge that internal battery.” -daily dot

Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times,


A Trump-era commission tasked with combating “false narratives about the American Founding” has urged the Biden administration to drop its proposal to fund history and civics programs that promote critical race theory or related curricula “under the misleading name of ‘anti-racism.&#x27;”

                    <span>Japan Extends State Of Emergency As Support For Canceling Olympics Rises

            
As demands to cancel the Tokyo Olympics intensify, Japan on Friday extended a state of emergency in Tokyo and eight other prefectures until June 20 as hospitals struggle to handle a rise in COVID-sickened patients.







The state of emergency had previously been slated to end on May 31, but strains on the medical system are still too intense for Japanese officials to be entirely comfortable with the current situation. Japan has seen a record number of COVID patients in critical condition in recent days, even as the number of new infections has slowed. This has prompted worries about infectious new COVID &quot;variants&quot; spreading in the country with the start of the Olympics just a few weeks away.

Following Friday&#x27;s bombshell revelation that Dr. Anthony Fauci has supported &#x27;gain of function&#x27; research, even arguing that the &quot;risks&quot; (which include a worldwide pandemic caused by a potential lab accident) were outweighed by the potential benefits to humanity, it&#x27;s worth revisiting a vote that quietly took place earlier this week in the Senate.







Sen. Paul has been arguing with Dr. Fauci about the merits of the research and whether they&#x27;re outweighed by the risks of deadly lab leaks for weeks now. He memorably took the good doctor to task during a hearing of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee hectoring over his prior support for gain of function research in China, to …</span>

Following now completed joint war games held by the US, Japan, France and Australia in the East China Sea off the southwest coast of Japan earlier this month, China has lashed out particularly at its large regional neighbor Australia, calling its military &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;insignificant&quot; at a moment the two are locked in a severe trade and diplomatic tit-for-tat dispute.

Many industries were throttled, bludgeoned, beaten, and even destroyed during the lockdowns of 2020. It will be years before the damage is repaired, and some of it is irreparable. 







One industry that did not suffer was that which was and is devoted to writing scientific papers on the Coronavirus. Talk about boom times! A report from October 2020 estimates that 87,000 studies have been written and published in some form on the topic. It’s surely more than 100,000 by now. These writers do not produce content out of the goodness of their hearts. It’s the old rule: subsidize something (thank you Bill Gates) and you get more of it.

Election season in Mexico has always been a dangerous game, with politicians regularly knocked off by cartels seeking to install &#x27;friendly&#x27; candidates by process of elimination. 







Since the start of the electoral process in Sep. 2020, eighty-eight politicians have been murdered nationwide, according to TeleSur. The most recent, Citizens Movement (MC) candidate Alma Barragan, was shot to death while driving by unidentified assailants, just a few hours after she attended a campaign event. Barragan marks the third murdered candidate in Guanajuato alone ahead of the region&#x27;s June 6 election.

Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer joined 43 California counties on May 26 in filing a civil lawsuit against the early release of 76,000 state inmates.



“It is my job as district attorney to keep Orange County safe,” Spitzer said in a press release.


“The public must be given the opportunity to question why the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation would decide that returning murders, child molesters, and rapists back into our neighborhoods more quickly somehow constitutes an emergency.”

Among the &quot;new&quot; things that Americans will notice during this year&#x27;s post-Covid Memorial Day will be skyrocketing prices at the pump.


Drivers are in store for the highest prices in seven years this summer, Reuters writes this week, as retail gas prices are the most expensive since 2014 at about $3.04 per gallon. 







And those prices have nowhere to go but up, as a year&#x27;s worth of pent up demand for leisure activities, vacation and summer sun come to fruition over the next three or four months. This could drive up prices even further during peak travel weeks during the summer.

Authored by Matt Taibbi via TK News,


Joe Biden is cruising, in a happy-place few politicians reach. Outside of a few grumpy right-wing outlets he faces almost no hostile press questioning, political threats within his own party are minimal, and his approval rating, if one believes the latest Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, hovers at an astonishing 64%.





Biden has the press paper-trained to a degree we haven’t seen in modern times. Not even at the height of the media’s drooling love affair with Barack Obama — a phenomenon I confess I was part of — did we ever see such enthusiastic, reflexive backing of White House messaging. The Biden press even reverses course on a dime when needed, with the past weeks being a supreme e…</span>

Authored by Peter Schiff via SchiffGold.com,


It’s dawning on many investors that our post-Covid financial problems may not be as easily solved as Washington claims...







The latest clue that trouble is brewing has come from the sudden and dramatic arrival of inflation. On May 12, it was revealed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) had risen 4.2% year-over-year, the fastest pace since 2008.


Some tried to downplay concern by pointing out that the gains resulted from the “base effect” of comparing current prices with the artificially depressed “Covid lockdown” prices of March and April of last year. But that ignores the more alarming trend of near-term price acceleration.

America&#x27;s top virologist, Anthony Fauci, argued in 2012 that the risks of a lab accident sparking a pandemic are outweighed by the potential benefits of manipulating viruses via gain-of-function research, according to previously unsurfaced remarks reported by Sharri Markson via The Australian.







&quot;In an unlikely but conceivable turn of events, what if that scientist becomes infected with the virus, which leads to an outbreak and ultimately triggers a pandemic?&quot; Fauci wrote in the American Society for Microbiology in 2012, adding &quot;Many ask reasonable questions: given the possibility of such a scenario – however remote – should the initial experiments have been performed and/or pub…</span>

Update (1330ET): President Biden just released the much-leaked and strawman&#x27;d Fiscal Year 2022 budget request to Congress on Friday, the first formal budget of his presidency.


The topline budget request for 2022 is $6 trillion. But of this, as we detailed below, only $300 billion is new spending requested for next year. Instead, the vast majority of it will be spent on programs the government is obligated by law to fund, like Medicare, Social Security and interest on the national debt. 



“Put together, this budget is an agenda for robust, durable economic growth and broadly shared prosperity,” said Shalanda Young, Biden’s acting White House budget director.

                    <span>&quot;Backdoor QE&quot; Is Working As Expected, But It&#x27;s About To Be Replaced With &quot;Stealth QT&quot;

            
It was back in February when we first said that (almost) nobody was paying attention to the &quot;mind-boggling liquidity&quot; that was about to hit the markets in the form of hundreds of billions in cash released from the Treasury&#x27;s TGA account held at the Fed. This historic liquidity injection by the Treasury and not the Fed (which continues to this day to inject $120BN in liquidity monthly from its ongoing QE) was, as we put it, a form of backdoor QE, which would push asset prices higher and depress real rates.

Once upon a time, we couldn&#x27;t go an hour without some dire news involving Deutsche Bank (and its tens of trillions of gross notional derivatives). Now, it&#x27;s Credit Suisse&#x27;s turn.


In what was at least the third flashing-red headline for the day referencing the scandal-plagued Swiss Bank, moments ago Bloomberg reported that Credit Suisse, still humiliated from the billions it lost on Archegos and Greensill and countless subsequent banker terminations and defections, has temporarily barred clients from pulling their cash from a feeder fund that that was sold as an investment option for rich clients at the bank’s wealth arm, and which invests with Renaissance Technologies &quot;after the str…</span>

                    <span>Tesla Reportedly &quot;Scrambling&quot; For Instrument Cluster Supplies

            
We may have a little more insight as to reports yesterday that Tesla was pre-paying for semiconductor parts to secure supply. Yesterday, we guessed that Tesla&#x27;s new &quot;pre-payment&quot; terms could be a result of suppliers showing little patience with the automaker, who has over $6 billion in payables.


But a new report overnight from DigiTimes Asia sheds more light on the situation, leading us to believe that Tesla could simply be short of supplies and desperately in need of parts to be able to hit production targets. 


The report notes that Tesla is &quot;scrambling&quot; for instrument cluster supplies:



Tesla is reportedly approaching IC suppliers in Taiwan, Korea and the US, seeking to secure steady supplies of au…</span>

With Tesla falling out of favor in China, one domestic EV maker, Li Auto, is predicting a tailwind.


The Chinese Tesla rival, which produces the Li One SUV, predicts that its sales will rise at least 15% in from April to June as a result of Tesla running &quot;foul of angry Chinese customers,&quot; SCMP reported on Wednesday. 


The company&#x27;s Li One SUV competes with Tesla&#x27;s Model Y. It is an extended-range sport-utility vehicle (SUV) that is priced at 328,000 yuan (US$51,316), according to the report. 


Li Auto said on Wednesday that Q2 deliveries would come in between 14,500 units and 15,500 units, up from estimates of 12,579 in the first three months of the year. Li reported a 13% decli…</span>

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


An Atlanta city councilman running for mayor, who last year supported a measure to reduce city police funding by tens of millions of dollars, had his car stolen by children on Wednesday, he and police confirmed.







Councilman Antonio Brown had been attending a ceremony in northeastern Atlanta at 12 p.m. Wednesday when several children jumped into his vehicle and drove away, he said.



“You don’t immediately think, ‘Oh, these kids are going to steal my car,’” Brown told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, referring to the incident, adding that the thieves appeared to be children, although one of them “acted as though he had a gun…</span>

Lockheed Martin and General Motors are teaming to develop the next-generation lunar vehicle for NASA&#x27;s upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon. 


The Artemis program aims to land astronauts on the lunar surface by the midpoint of the decade. For exploration purposes, astronauts will need &quot;surface mobility that is critical to enable and sustain long-term exploration of the lunar surface. These next-generation rovers will dramatically extend the range of astronauts,&quot; a Lockheed press release read. 







The new lunar vehicle &quot;may allow astronauts to explore the lunar surface in unprecedented fashion and support discovery in places where humans have never gone before,&quot; the defense contract continued.

“A long-term outage owing to EMP could disable most critical supply chains, leaving the U.S. population living in conditions similar to centuries past, prior to the advent of electric power. In the 1800s, the U.S. population was less than 60 million, and those people had many skills and assets necessary for survival without today’s infrastructure. An extended blackout today could result in the death of a large fraction of the American people through the effects of societal collapse, disease and starvation.

Despite essentially cutting off all international travel in an attempt to &quot;raise the drawbridge&quot; and keep out COVID-19 after mostly purging it from their society, Australia is entering its fourth COVID-inspired lockdown in Melbourne, the country&#x27;s second-largest city. The lockdown began Thursday and was set to remain in place for a week for Melbourne and the rest of Victoria state after a new cluster of cases was uncovered, yielding 26 new infections, including one person who was sent to intensive care, the AP reports.


Another 10K people have reportedly had some form of contact with those infected.

                    <span>Will The Madness Of 2020 Last?

            
Authored by Victor Davis Hanson, op-ed via The Epoch Times,


The COVID-19 pandemic is ending with mass vaccinations. So is the national quarantine. The rioting, looting, and arson that began in the summer of 2020 is finally sputtering out.


The acrimony over the 2020 election is fading. Trump Derangement Syndrome became abstract when Donald Trump left office and was ostracized from social media.


In other words, the American people are slowly regaining their senses after the epidemic of mass hysteria that gripped the nation last year.







But many Americans wonder whether what Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and the hard left wrought last year will last when the nation is no longer gripped by 2020 madness.

                    <span>The Fed Explains Why Stocks Melt-Up In Overnight Trading

            
By now everyone has seen some iteration of this chart (most recently discussed here), which shows that whereas stocks are generally flat over longer periods of time during the regular &quot;cash&quot;, or day session, they tend to melt up during the overnight hours when liquidity is far lower and when the &quot;pajama trades&quot; come out and play.







And while there is no single, widely accepted reason for this &quot;overnight drift&quot;, the post-closed meltup phenomenon has been one of the most popular and recurring strategies in equity markets, with many traders selling spoos when the day session begins and then re-buying at the market close in pursuit of scarce alpha.

                    <span>15 State Treasurers Warn They Will Pull Assets From Banks That Obstruct the Fossil Fuel Industry

            
Authored by Samuel Allegri via The Epoch Times,


Fifteen Republican State Treasurers sent a warning that they will pull assets from financial institutions if they give in to Federal pressure to de-carbonize and “refuse to lend to or invest in” the fossil fuel and coal industry.

                    <span>WeWork Pays Another $245M To Former CEO Adam Neumann To Clear Last Obstacle To SPAC Deal

            
WeWork co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann may well be remembered as the worst CEO ever. But that hasn&#x27;t stopped him from collecting billions of dollars in payouts on his way out the door at WeWork, as SoftBank&#x27;s Masayoshi Son was forced to effectively bribe Neumann to relinquish control of the flailing office rental company.







A legal fight erupted when SoftBank tried to renege on some $3 billion it owed to Neumann and other early investors, but it appears this issue was settled out of court.


But according to the latest documents released by the company, Neumann has just received even more goodies from the firm, including a final &quot;enhanced&quot; package worth roughly one qua…</span>

                    <span>&#x27;It Would Be Detrimental To A Lot Of Companies&#x27;: Jamie Dimon Slams Biden Tax Plan

            
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon went scorched earth on President Biden&#x27;s tax plan, which would raise the current corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, arguing that it would result in capital flight out of the United States.







&quot;The tax increase is actually four times what the tax decrease was from 2017,&quot; Dimon said during a Thursday virtual hearing before the US House Committee on Financial Services. &quot;You all know the phrase the devil is in the details, well the details here are all that matter, not the top line of 28%.&quot;


&quot;If you want to have a healthy, growing, competitive America against the rest of the world, you need a global, competitive tax rate,&quot; Dimon added. &quot;It would be detrimental to a lot of companies, it would push a lot of capital overseas.&quot;





Dimon cast doubt on the Biden tax plan earlier this month, calling it &#x27;a little crazy,&#x27; however today&#x27;s comments mark the strongest pushback yet from the top banker.


&quot;We’re just throwing money. It doesn’t work,&quot; Dimon said in a recorded interview for the JPMorgan general membership meeting on May 6, adding &quot;I’m concerned about how the money’s going to be spent.&quot;


&quot;We already waste tremendous sums of money.&quot;

China&#x27;s recent aggressive crackdown on soaring commodity prices (going as far as dragging the PBOC&#x27;s monetary regime into it, with the central bank stating this morning that the surging yuan is in no way a response to explosive commodity prices, honestly), has provided the world&#x27;s deflationists with some hope that the recent huge spike in commodity prices may be coming to an end. To others, like Goldman&#x27;s extremely bullish commodities team, China&#x27;s intervention has led to a rather unpleasant hit to its thesis, and in response today&#x27;s Goldman&#x27;s head of commodities, Jeffrey Currie drafted a note saying that the pullback in commodities after China’s warnings over onshore specu…</span>

Authored by Patrick Andriesen via IllinoisPolicy.org,


Grocery and liquor stores would be barred from selling beer, wine and liquor after 10 p.m. if Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot gets her way. She said the move would curb crime by stopping gatherings outside liquor stores and help recovering bars and restaurants.







Mayor Lightfoot introduced an amendment Wednesday that would permanently ban Chicago stores from selling beer, wine and other alcoholic drinks after 10 p.m.


In April 2020, Lightfoot instituted the controversial 9 p.m. liquor curfew in Chicago to prevent residents from gathering outside during the coronavirus pandemic. Stores had been allowed to stay open until 2 a.m. most…</span>

Authored by Cal Thomas, op-ed via The Epoch Times,


Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas is reportedly considering the development of tools that would help America’s children discern truth from lies and know when they are being fed “disinformation.”







The Washington Times, which first reported the story, says a department spokesperson declined to give details, but that more information would be revealed “in the coming weeks.”


Mayorkas might want to start by fact-checking his recent claim that the U.S. southern border is “closed.” He made the statement when news pictures showed waves of people crossing the border. Should kids believe him, or their “lying eyes”?

                    <span>​​​​​​​Russian Spy Ship Quietly Parked In Waters Off Hawaii

            
A Russian Navy surveillance ship parked in international waters off Kauai, an island in the Central Pacific, part of the Hawaiian archipelago, has delayed a Missile Defense Agency missile test, according to Honolulu Star-Advertiser. 


The US Pacific Fleet confirmed Wednesday that it &quot;is aware of the Russian vessel operating in international waters in the vicinity of Hawaii, and will continue to track it through the duration of its time here.&quot; 


The ship has been operating in international waters just 13 nautical miles west of Kauai for several days. The vessel is not broadcasting an automatic identification system signal. 



&quot;Through maritime patrol aircraft, surface ships and joint capabilities, we can closely monitor all vessels in the Indo-Pacific area of operations,&quot; US Pacific Fleet&#x27;s statement continued. 



U.S. Naval Institute News first identified the presence of the spy ship, indicating it was a Russian Navy Vishnya-class auxiliary general intelligence (AGI) ship Kareliya (SSV-535). Honolulu Star-Advertiser then expanded on this and said the vessel is in the vicinity of the Pacific Missile Range and has &quot;delayed&quot; a missile test. 







The question remains: Why does a Russian signals intelligence vessel sit off the coast of Kauai? Is Moscow sending the Biden administration a message of new strength in the Pacific?

                    <span>Retail Investors Storm Back Into The Market: This Is What They Are Buying

            
It was less than than three weeks ago when we first noted that retail participation in stock trading had seemingly collapsed after a wild start to the year, with JPMorgan reporting that US retail investors share in equity trading declined sharply in March after a strong January and February, and a record high share of 28% in December.







And while April and the start of May exhibited a similar continued decline in both retail participation and performance of &quot;retail favorite&quot; stocks, which underperformed the broader market by 8% since mid-March, things have changed dramatically in the past two weeks and as Goldman notes in a new piece discussing the &quot;Recent performance of stocks with high levels of retail activity&quot;, stocks with high retail trading volumes have outperformed by 5% since May 12th, with half of this outperformance occurring yesterday (Wednesday). 


Echoing JPMorgan&#x27;s observations, Goldman then notes that while declines in daily trades at retail brokers showed significant declines last week (DARTs), leading to fresh concerns that retail trading activity was on the decline - with many going so far as to conclude that retail investors were no longer investing their stimmies - this too appears to have been the wrong conclusion, as the rise in retail stocks yesterday and especially today, when both GME and AMC have soared...







... suggesting it may be too early to call an end to elevated retail activity.







So what are retail investors buying? Based on Goldman&#x27;s “small-lot trading” analysis, these are the 50 stocks where retail was the most active yesterday in shares and options.







Not enough? Here are the stocks with high “small lot” trading activity in Options

President Trump‘s former national security advisor Michael Flynn commented on the renewed focus on the theory that the coronavirus came from a lab in Wuhan, saying that he believes it was a ‘weaponised operation’.



“We’ve had over a year of people all over the world having to answer tough questions,” Flynn said during an interview on 1320 AM WJAS.



The three star general continued “The people in this country are demanding answers. I believe we what we are going to find out is that this was a weaponized operation by the nation of China with some collaboration… with other countries.”

If you had a sneaking suspicion that Wall Street was starting to bet against the &quot;untouchable&quot; Cathie Wood, as we did over the last couple months, you were right.


Today it was revealed that &quot;about two dozen investment advisers&quot; that included Balyasny Asset Management and a unit of Blackstone bought put options on ARK&#x27;s Innovation ETF during the first quarter. Blackstone bought puts on 1.3 million ARKK shares and Balyasny acquired puts on 436,500 shares. 


The managers saw Wood&#x27;s fund as a &quot;alternative to buffer against a slump in stocks that surged during the pandemic,&quot; that buying puts on an index, the report said. In other words, the asset managers were so confident in Wood&#x27;s ab…</span>

President Biden is just fine releasing the US Intelligence community&#x27;s 90-day examination of where COVID-19 originated, unless it contains surprises.


Shortly before boarding Air Force One for a Thursday trio to Ohio, Biden was ashed whether he planned to release the intelligence report, to which he replied &quot;Yes,&quot; adding &quot;unless there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m unaware of.&quot;

                    <span>Life Insurance &amp; COVID-19; Something Doesn&#x27;t Make Sense

            
Authored by Jeff Harris via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace &amp; Prosperity,


You would think that during the worst Pandemic since the 1918 Spanish Flu life insurance companies would be hedging their bets to avoid major losses from Covid-19. 


I haven’t written a life policy for several years so I was wondering what was going on?


I called one of the brokers I deal with that interacts with hundreds of big life insurers to get an inside look into how the Covid crisis has changed their business.





Imagine my surprise when she said it was pretty much business as usual!


Last year when the hysteria was just getting ramped up she did say the companies temporarily tightened up underwriting and reduced the amount of coverage they would offer. But as time went by and the hard data came rolling in those same companies went back to business as usual.
I asked her specifically if life insurers wanted a Covid test as part of the underwriting process and she said none that she was aware of.


Hmm, that’s pretty interesting isn’t it?


The most lethal pandemic in decades descends on the globe with deadly mutations taking millions of innocent lives and the life insurance companies couldn’t care less.
I also asked if the cost per thousand of coverage had increased due to Covid and again she said no.


Rates were pretty much the same as they were before the Covid Pandemic ravaged the earth.


Life Insurance companies are very risk adverse. 


They don’t like losing money to unnecessary claims.


The fact they’re treating Covid as a nonevent should be an indicator that something is very wrong with the whole narrative.

President Biden, possibly most famous for his - and his son&#x27;s - business dealings in China coming into question whilst running for the Presidency, may wake up this week to find out from one of his top advisors that he&#x27;s now a China hawk.


That is, if you ask Kurt Campbell, the U.S. coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs on the National Security Council. 


Campbell said this week that the U.S. was &quot;entering a period of intense competition with China as the government running the world’s second-biggest economy becomes ever more tightly controlled by President Xi Jinping,&quot; according to Bloomberg. 


Campbell, speaking at Stanford University, commented: “The period that was broadly described as engage…</span>

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


Criminals who repeatedly targeted an auto shop in Spring Lake, North Carolina by leaving racist graffiti referencing the KKK and Nazis turned out to be two African-American men after the owner caught them on camera.







Business owner Dwyane Haynesworth (who is black) took action after having a car stole off his lot and then discovering the racist graffiti, which included a drawing of a swastika.


After setting up the security cameras, that same night the criminals returned and broke into more vehicles before smashing windows and attempting to hot wire one of the cars.

Real Vision managing editor Ed Harrison welcomes Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, back to the Daily Briefing to update viewers on how the bond market is reacting to the re-opening of the economy and the sustained dovishness of the Federal Reserve. Bianco analyzes how the Fed’s bias towards employment within its dual mandate is impacting inflation expectations and bond yields, and he and Harrison discuss today’s jobless claims within that context as well as ballooning budget deficits and central bank balance sheet expansion.

We knew it would be a crazy day for today&#x27;s reverse repo early this morning, when the overnight GCF repo rate traded at -0.01% and refused to rise, an indication that there was far too much money chasing good collateral.







Looking at the scramble for repo, interbroker dealer Wrightson ICAP said on Thursday morning that it saw Reverse Repo volumes rising to around $470 billion Thursday, though the risks are “still tilted to the high side.”


They were, because moments ago the Fed announced that at 1:15pm some 50 counterparties (up from 46 on Wednesday) parked $485.329BN in reserves with the Fed (in exchange for the generous rate of 0.000%), which was up $35BN overnight, up $134BN in the past wee…</span>

On Wednesday Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced efforts to combat the growing trend of rampant and unpredictable blackouts experienced across parts of the country of over 80 million people at the start of a hot summer, particularly in already strained major cities. By many accounts what was somewhat already a &quot;norm&quot; under American sanctions has come early this year - namely the sporadic blackouts, increasingly angering the population just ahead of a key presidential election in June.

There&#x27;s been a lot of speculation this year about what it might take for western governments like the US to meet the carbon emissions targets laid out in the Paris Accords, which President Biden has enthusiastically rejoined. One study by the IEA concluded that all oil and gas firms would have to halt new projects in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.


While progressives increasingly demand more aggressive change, moderate Democrats and Republicans have long insisted that markets would naturally wean society off of its dependence on fossil fuels as renewables, nuclear and other alternatives to fossil fuel become more affordable.

After nearly 18 months of punishing anyone who suggested that COVID-19 might have originated in a Wuhan lab, Facebook has decided to stop removing posts which claim the virus was man-made or manufactured, a company spokesperson told Politico on Wednesday.







The move comes after the Wall Street Journal reported that three lab workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were hospitalized in late 2019 with symptoms consistent with the virus - building on previous reporting by the Washington Post&#x27;s Josh Rogin. Both articles cast doubt on the mainstream media&#x27;s unsupported claim that COVID-19 jumped from bats to humans through an intermediary species - as opposed to…</span>

Authored by Mark Glennon via Wirepoints.org,


Most Illinoisans are unaware, but their General Assembly is poised to pass a resolution for a state constitutional amendment, the consequences of which are hard to overstate. It would vastly expand union power, permanently, particularly public union power that is already extreme.







Limited media coverage so far characterizes the amendment mostly as an attempt to permanently ban right-to-work and lock in current worker protections. That would be bad enough, since the majority of states are now right to work including nearby competitors Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana and Iowa. And Illinois is already an outlier in how much power it has given to …</span>

The calm of a sunny May afternoon in Taiwan was broken by what the Nikkei describes as a crescendo of smartphones buzzing due to a national emergency alert: electricity blackouts were coming due to a malfunction at a power plant in the south of the island. People had no time to prepare. There were more than 30 reports of people being trapped in elevators half an hour after the warning in the capital city.

                    <span>Are Chinese Stocks Ready To Outperform?

            
By Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at SaxoBank


Summary: Chinese equities were rallying 3.6% today on signals from the Chinese government to curb inflationary pressures from rising commodity markets reducing inflation expectations and boosting the earnings outlook. US equities are currently valued at a valuation premium to Chinese equities which suggest historically that Chinese equities could outperform over the next 26 weeks. The two country&#x27;s technology sectors are equally valued on a 2-year forward basis on EV/EBITDA but with a valuation skew on Chinese technology mega caps making them more attractive on valuation. The long-term growth outlook is better for Chinese technology companies and thus we expect the market to beg…</span>

While many of the SPACs he has sponsored have seen less than stellar returns, Chamath Palihapitiya and his VC firm, Social Capital, are doing just fine.  Palihapitiya has been a player in Silicon Valley for years, but thanks to the SPAC boom, 2020 was a breakout year for the former Facebook employee. Not only did he rake in profits for his firm and his investors, but SPACs have changed the nature of the IPO process







Somewhat lost in all the excitement of the SPAC boom is the fact that Social Capital is a VC firm that has invested in more than 70 companies during the past decade, which has been a lucrative one for Silicon Valley. Social Capi…</span>

Authored by Liam Brooks via AmericanThinker.com,


Teen climate zealot Greta Thunberg raised some eyebrows last week when she tossed an f-bomb in a video she posted Saturday to commemorate the International Day of Biological Diversity. (Something I&#x27;ve admittedly never heard of.) 



&quot;Our relationship with nature is broken,&quot; Saint Greta flatly stated.


&quot;But relationships can change. If we don&#x27;t change, we are f**ked.&quot;




”Our relationship with nature is broken. But relationships can change. When we protect nature - we are nature protecting itself.”

                    <span>&quot;Rescue Operation Underway&quot; - Boat With 200 Passengers Sinks In Nigeria

            
Dozens of people are missing in north-western Nigeria after a boat carrying 200 capsized on Wednesday, according to Reuters, citing a state spokesperson.



&quot;The boat was ferrying about 200 passengers&quot; coming from the neighboring country of Niger, said Yahaya Sarki, a spokesperson for the governor of Kebbi.


&quot;Their locally made wooden boat capsized mid-water,&quot; Sarki said. &quot;Bodies are still being recovered. We can&#x27;t ascertain the number for now.&quot;



The boat was reportedly overloaded when it suddenly snapped into two in the middle of the Niger River. 







Reports of how many people on board vary from news agency to news agency—some say between 160 and 200.


Authorities in Kebbi State told the BBC that first responders had been dispatched to the scene to search for survivors. 



&quot;A rescue operation is underway, but only 22 survivors and one dead body have been recovered,&quot; a local official reportedly said.



Qasimu Umar Wara, a resident of Wara town, told Reuters the passengers were returning from a newly-discovered gold vein in Niger. 



&quot;They usually go there in the evenings and return to Wara in the morning,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of them are petty traders, food vendors and the local miners.&quot;



The wooden boat is reportedly rated for 80 passengers, and the accident is likely due to overloading.

Since Bill and Melinda Gates first announced their divorce earlier this month, barely a day has passed without some unflattering new revelation, as the American media apparently scrambles to compensate for all those years where it treated Bill Gates with kid gloves.


It&#x27;s bad enough that Melinda reportedly divorced Bill over his insistence on maintaining ties with Jeffrey Epstein, something that has stoked speculation about whether Gates might face more sexual harassment allegations (sure enough, reports have emerged claiming he was essentially pushed out at Microsoft over improper behavior involving a female subordinate) or that he might be caught up in the…</span>

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Following calls last summer from groups such as Black Lives Matter to “defund the police,” a number of city officials are now walking back statements to go through with cutting funding to law enforcement due to surges in crime levels.


The Minneapolis City Council several months ago voted to approve $6.4 million more in funding to the police department, coming after a number of councilmembers last year pledged to completely abolish the department.

Authored by Steve Watson via Summit News,


A professor with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine has said that there is a general dismissal of the fact that more than half of all Americans have developed natural immunity to the coronavirus and that it constitutes “one of the biggest failures of our current medical leadership.”







Dr. Marty Makary made the comments during a recent interview, noting that “natural immunity works” and it is wrong to vilify those who don’t want the vaccine because they have already recovered from the virus.

Authored by Dave DeCamp via AntiWar.com,


According to a report from The New York Times, US troops are expected to be out of Afghanistan by early to mid-July, well before the September 11th deadline set by President Biden.


Unnamed US officials told the Times that Washington’s allies are also expected to be out by July, although Germany is apparently struggling to keep up the pace. US Central Command on Tuesday said the Afghanistan withdrawal process was about 16 to 25 percent complete.

Activist firm Engine No. 1 has won at least two seats on the board of Exxon Mobile Corp. following a multi-month battle over the oil giant&#x27;s board of directors to change the company&#x27;s path towards one centered around achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner, according to WSJ.







Engine No. 1, an upstart hedge fund, owns a tiny 0.02% stake in Exxon, has gone on a blitz against the company since December to shift away from fossil fuels to a zero-carbon world. The fund was founded by veteran hedge fund investor Chris James.

Just a few weeks ago, the market was rife with speculation that amid galloping inflation, the Fed would almost certainly breach the topic of the infamous taper during its June 16 FOMC meeting, and if not then, then no later than the September 22 meeting, which takes place just after the late-August Jackson Hole central banker outing in which most of the Fed&#x27;s &quot;radical&quot; ideas in the past decade have been introduced.


Not any more.

Five people were arrested overnight in Portland, Oregon after a riot broke out on the anniversary of George Floyd’s death.


The quintet was part of a crowd who set a fire in a dumpster next to the Justice Center, a building that houses a jail and law enforcement offices, while chanting “Burn the building down,” according to a Portland Police Bureau incident summary and photographs and video footage from the scene.

 &quot;Wall Street speculators are zeroing in on the next U.S. credit crisis: the mall.... Its no secret many mall complexes have been struggling for years as Americans do more of their shopping online. But now, theyre catching the eye of hedge-fund types who think some may soon buckle under their debts, much the way many homeowners did nearly a decade ago.&quot;



In late 2019, none other than iconic investor Carl Icahn jumped in to the the big short 2.0, shorting America&#x27;s malls by going lon…</span>

                    <span>The Ghost Of Arthur Burns - What If It&#x27;s Not &quot;Transitory&quot;?

            
Authored by Stephen Roach via Project-Syndicate,


The US Federal Reserve is insisting that recent increases in the price of food, construction materials, used cars, personal health products, gasoline, and appliances reflect transitory factors that will quickly fade with post-pandemic normalization. But what if they are a harbinger, not a &quot;noisy&quot; deviation?







Memories can be tricky. I have long been haunted by the inflation of the 1970s. Fifty years ago, when I had just started my career as a professional economist at the Federal Reserve, I was witness to the birth of the Great Inflation as a Fed insider. That left me with the recurring nightmares of a financial post-traumatic stress disorder. The bad dre…</span>

                    <span>IAEA Chief Warns Iran Has Already Reached Nuclear Weapons Capable Enrichment

            
Amid the fifth and what&#x27;s expected to be the final round of Iran nuclear talks in Vienna, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has voiced that time is running out on reaching an agreement given the Islamic Republic has already reached bomb-building capability in terms of enriched uranium purity levels. 


IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told Financial Times that Iran has reached uranium purity levels that &quot;only countries making bombs are reaching&quot; after routinely ramping up enrichment since Trump pulled out of the Obama-era JCPOA back in May 2018.

Authored by Jonathan Turley,


The long-awaited, though partial, release of a memorandum from the Justice Department this week left many “frustrated,” as predicted by the Washington Post, in Washington. The reason is what it did not contain.  Critics had sought the memo as the “smoking gun” to show how former Attorney General Bill Barr scuttled any obstruction charges against Donald Trump.


Instead, the memo showed the opposite. 







The staff of the OLC actually found that the allegations did not meet the standard of obstruction even without any defenses or privileges related to Trump’s office.


The issue of obstruction of justice ran throughout Barr’s second…</span>

                    <span>It Reeks Of Deflation After Second Stellar Treasury Auction In A Row

            
After yesterday&#x27;s blockbuster 2Y auction which pushed bond yields sharply lower and which we said was an indication that the inflationary storm has passed with bond traders no longer expecting any rate hikes for the foreseeable future, moments ago the stench of deflation was positively rancid after today&#x27;s $61BN 5-Year auction was just as almost as solid as Tuesday&#x27;s auction.


Printing at a high yield of 0.788%, the 2Y auction stopped 5.5bps below April&#x27;s auction and also stopped through the When Issued 0.794% by 0.6bps, the first stop through for the tenor since Jan 2021.


Meanwhile, and like yesterday, the Bid to Cover jumped, rising from 2.31 last month to 2.49 today, the highest since Sept 2020 and obviously well above the six-auction average of 2.34.


The internals were also stellar with Indirects taking down a whopping 64.4%, the highest foreign award since August 2020 and far above the 57.9% recent average. And with Directs taking down a lower than average 14.9%, Dealers were left holding 20.8% of the auction, the lowest since August.







Overall, a stellar bond auction, and one which together with yesterday&#x27;s 2Y auction suggests that demand for tomorrow&#x27;s 7Y issuance will be vastly greater compared to the dismal 7Y bond sale in late February when the bellybuster auction was nearly a flop and sparked a major bond and stock market selloff.

by Robert Dalheim of Woodworking Network







The U.S. Department of Commerce says it will seek to double tariff rates on most Canadian softwood lumber, angering home builders. New rates vary by company. West Fraser goes from 9 percent to 11.4 percent, Canfor from 4.6 to 21 percent, Resolute Forest from 20.3 to 30.2 percent, and J.D. Irving from 4.2 to 15.8 percent.


The overall increase is from 9 percent to 18.32 percent.


Home builders, who had been urging for a removal of tariffs, expressed their disappointment.

In a rare and refreshing interview which on YouTube has garnered 100,000 views in less than 24 hours, British comedian and actor Russell Brand and former Intercept journalist Glenn Greenwald teamed up to explain last year&#x27;s scandalous coordination by the mainstream media and social media companies to ensure the Hunter Biden laptop story and accompanying revelations over the Hunter-Ukrainian Burisma energy company scandal never reached broader public view.

Authored by Janita Kan via The Epoch Times,


Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on Monday said he was willing to support a Democrat-led bill that was passed by the House to create an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 breach of the U.S. Capitol.







Romney answered that he “would support the bill” when asked by reporters how he would vote if Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) starts a debate on the House bill, according to multiple congressional reporters. He is the first Republican in the Senate to do so.


The Utah senator’s comments come on the same day that Schumer vowed to bring the bill for a vote on the Senate floor.

Last week&#x27;s good news of easing vessel congestion earlier this month outside the busiest U.S. gateway for trade with Asia showed a glimmer of hope that supply chain disruptions could subside had flipped last week as more containerships join the queue.  


Bloomberg data shows the number of containerships queuing off the coast of Los Angeles reached the highest in two weeks.


As of Sunday, 21 containerships were anchored waiting for entry into L.A.-Long Beach, compared with 19 a week earlier. The bottleneck peaked at around 40 vessels in the queue in early February and has steadily declined ever since, but the latest data shows progress could be reversing.

Via South Front,


On May 25th, the Iranian Army kicked off a large-scale military drill to practice electronic warfare tactics, this drill on electronic warfare is dubbed ‘Separ-e-Aseman 1400’ (Sky Shield 1400).







According to a statement, this joint drill is being held by the strategic electronic warfare forces of the four forces of the Army and covers large areas of Iran. Rapid response and electronic warfare units of the Army’s Ground Force, Air Force, Navy and Air Defense are participating in the joint aerial maneuvers, codenamed Sky Shield 1400, whose headquarters will be located in Iran’s central province of Isfahan.

Authored by John Tamny via RealClear Markets (emphasis ours),


If you want to act in movies or on television in Hollywood, you must be a member of the Screen Actors Guild. That’s why the accession of a “SAG” card is such a momentous achievement for actors. It means they’re Hollywood legal as it were.







So why does acting professionally require union membership? The answer is very simple: SAG wants to prevent those yearning to be stars from flooding the market, and subsequently bidding starting wages down to zero.


It’s as old as the hills for actors and actresses to wistfully proclaim that “I just want a chance to show them what I can do.” Since they’re all looking for a break, it’s not unreasonable to specula…</span>

After by the end of last year New York City&#x27;s beleaguered subways fell to carrying a mere 30% of pre-pandemic volumes but also as vandalism and random violent attacks soared, sparking widespread concern over safety, officials with the state&#x27;s Metropolitan Transportation Authority are now looking to spend $2.2 million a month on private security guards, a recent Wall Street Journal report confirmed.


By month&#x27;s end some 200 private guards are expected to be present at stations and on trains, which is double what it&#x27;s been in prior months - after the MTA urged more city police amid rising crime in areas of the transit system where there&#x27;s often near-deserted platforms given the prior COVI…</span>

I cannot identify who exactly popularized the term “woke.”


But I’ve had cause to wheel it out here and elsewhere on and off for the past few years, generally when describing some absurd piece of academic or corporate or government obeisance to political correctness.

                    <span>Goldman Wins Regulatory Approval To Launch Chinese Wealth Management Business

            
Ever since China started allowing American money managers access to the hundreds of millions of middle class Chinese investors and savers via &quot;joint ventures&quot; with domestic firms, some of the biggest US buy-side firms, including BlackRock and Vanguard, have already launched their Chinese operations.


And now, after months of cajoling local regulators, it appears Goldman Sachs has just won approval to launch a wealth management venture of its own alongside ICBC, one of China&#x27;s largest banks, the FT says.


So pretty soon, the Chinese elite will have the opportunity to join their American peers by becoming Goldman clients.

Authored by Jonathan Maze via RestaurantBusinessOnline.com,


Subway franchisees recently started pushing the company to dramatically reduce the ongoing fees they pay the company in a bid to keep more of them in business.







But Subway is moving in the other direction. The sandwich giant’s newest franchise agreement increases their ongoing royalty payments by 25%, numerous sources told Restaurant Business. The result would send higher what many say is an already unusually high royalty rate at a time when the chain is closing more than 1,000 locations a year.


Currently, the Milford, Conn.-based franchisor charges operators a base royalty of 8% of a store’s revenue—or $8 for every $100 in sales a location generat…</span>

Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wants to end what is effectively legalized insider trading by members of Congress by barring them from trading individual stocks ever again.







Warren first attempted to push through similar legislation with the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act she introduced in 2018 and then again in 2020. Both bills unsurprisingly died in the Senate Finance Committee, which Warren sits on.


The renewed push comes as several members of Congress have come under recent scrutiny for profitable stock trades in recent months, according to Business Insider. The include Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC), Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) and former Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler…</span>

“Beliefs aren’t facts.” 


That would be an unremarkable title for an unremarkable column except for who wrote it. In a new column in Persuasion, Northwestern University President Morton Schapiro took on the illiberal tyranny that permeates most of higher education.


Schapiro, you may remember, is the one who told his incoming freshmen to “look for safe spaces” and pledged that “if you can’t find them, we will help you find them.” Regarding traumatic ideas, Schapiro said, “If they say that…you shouldn’t be warned to prepare yourself psychologically for that, that somehow that’s coddling, those people are lunatics.” As for micr…</span>

                    <span>WTI Bounces Back Above $66 After Inventory Draws Across Entire Complex

            
Oil prices ended marginally lower after a choppy day of investors tempering expectations of an early return of oil exporter Iran to international crude markets (bullish) and US virus cases falling rapidly ahead of Memorial Day travels (bullish) battling with the overall weakness in economic data and slop in US equity markets and lower bond yields (bearish).



&quot;Oil prices... remain at high levels as the high season for oil demand is approaching and as restrictions are lifted in much of Europe and the United States,&quot; said Louise Dickson, oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy.



The swings in crude and product stocks in the last couple of weeks have been noisy thanks to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown. This week we should start to put that behind us, although product stocks may still be impacted.

Crude -439k (-1mm exp)

Gasoline -1.986mm (-1.1mm exp)

	

	

	
Distillates -5.137mm (-2mm exp)

	


Analysts expected inventory draws across the board this week, and they were right with Gasoline stocks down notably more than expected for the 7th straight week...

WTI hovered around $65.90 ahead of the API data and pushed back above $66 after the print.








&quot;Crude prices are in wait-and-see mode until the fifth round of negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal are done,&quot; said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, noting &quot;Energy traders need to know how much Iranian crude is going to hit the market.&quot;



Iran may have some 69 million barrels of oil in floating storage waiting on tankers to travel to buyers when U.S. sanctions on its crude oil exports are removed, estimates from E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers cited by Bloomberg showed on Tuesday.

The day started off with an exuberant buying-panic in Small Caps at the US cash open (as the rest of the majors were sold). That lasted around 12 minutes before Small Caps reversed that maniacal spike and everything accelerated into the red and beyond into the European close. A brief bounce ensued, only for that rip to be sold and as the old &quot;WSB&quot; names started to rise, so Small Caps and the rest of the major indices tumbled in the last hour. Nasdaq managed to close green, none of the other majors did with Small Caps the laggards (from up 1% at the open to down 1% at the close)

In March, Governor Greg Abbott announced that Texas would open for business 100 percent without a statewide mask mandate. 







The pro-lockdown “experts” were shocked. If a state as big as Texas joined Florida and succeeded in thumbing its nose at “the science” – which told us that for the first time in history healthy people should be forced to stay in their houses and wear oxygen-restricting face masks – then the lockdown narrative would begin falling apart.

                    <span>The SPAC Bubble Is Bursting: &quot;Dozens&quot; Of Companies Canceling Mergers As PIPE Investors Evaporate

            
SPACs have officially fallen out of favor. 


The SPAC bubble burst started with fallen angel Nikola Motors and has since continued, with short sellers and market skeptics unveiling the less than savory elements to numerous names brought public through the merger-style transaction that allows companies to go public quicker, and with less red tape, than the traditional IPO process.


Chamath Palihapitiya, once heralded as the &quot;king of SPACs&quot; is now more likely to be seen as the face of a SPAC bubble that looks as though it is in the process of popping. 


As a result of the bubble bursting, banks are starting to &quot;pass&quot; on funding SPAC transactions. One recent example was Si…</span>

Don&#x27;t look now but the meme stocks are back.


Having crept higher in recent days, both Gamestop and AMC, the two most popular meme stocks which shook the hedge fund industry in February when several prominent hedge funds suffered massive losses on their shorts, have exploded higher today, with GME up as much as 18%...







... and AMC close behind, up 14%.







The move may be a ramp in sympathy because while GME short interest is a pale shadow of its former glorious self...







... AMC&#x27;s short interest has soared back to all time highs.







Whatever the reason behind the buying frenzy, volumes are massive: more than 123 million shares of AMC had changed hands by 2:35 p.m. in N…</span>

Secretary of State Antony Blinken&#x27;s Mideast trip where he first met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Tuesday was supposed to focus on maintaining the Israel-Gaza truce and finding a lasting solution toward preventing a future flair up of violence. 


However, an emboldened Netanyahu bluntly shared his thoughts on the impending restoration of the Iran nuclear deal while standing next to Blinken during the press conference that followed their meeting. As expected Netanyahu urged the US to stay away from the deal, forcing Blinken to quickly contradict the Israeli leader, leading to an awkward exchange among the close allies. It took a mere 90 seconds for Netanyahu…</span>

Authored by Gary Galles via The Mises Institute,


It seems that every time something adverse happens in the labor market, it restarts the partisan battle between those currently in and out of power as to who is a better steward of the economy.







That was illustrated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics&#x27;s (BLS) release of the job numbers for April, which made headlines when job growth, which was expected to surge, came in “unexpectedly” low. The 266,000 jobs created were only a quarter of some forecasts, which topped 1 million. Further, March job creation was also revised down by 146,000. And unemployment ticked up for the first time since the lockdown, despite a reportedly massive shortage of workers, as illustrated b…</span>

At an event outside a US Micron Technology Inc chip factory on Monday, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told an audience that a proposed bill on Capitol Hill for $52 billion could bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing by funding seven to 10 new US factories, according to Reuters.







Raimondo told the audience in a tented event outside of Micron&#x27;s Manassas, Virginia, chip factory that she expects the $52 billion proposal to enhance US competitiveness with China would generate &quot;$150 billion-plus&quot; in investment for chip manufacturing and research from state and federal governments and private-sector firms.

Ahead of today&#x27;s 1:15pm overnight Reverse Repo deadline we asked (for the second day in a row) if today was the day the repo market finally cracks, pushing the amount of reserves parked at the Fed to a new record above $500 billion.



$500BN in reverse repo today?

— zerohedge (@zerohedge) May 25, 2021


And for the second day in a row, we were off, but we are getting warmed by the day: on Tuesday, the Fed revealed that the amount of overnight reserves parked at the Fed rose by another $38BN to $433BN (with 48 counteparties, down from 54 yesterday) from $394.9BN on Monday, which was the 3rd highest in history, up a whopping $190 billion in one week and the highest non-quarter end…</span>

Let&#x27;s explore quantum computing, problems it might solve, and what it will do to current security protocols and blockchain.







What is a Quantum Computer?


The New Scientist answers the question What is a Quantum Computer?



Classical computers, which include smartphones and laptops, encode information in binary “bits” that can either be 0s or 1s. In a quantum computer, the basic unit of memory is a quantum bit or qubit.


For instance, eight bits is enough for a classical computer to represent any number between 0 and 255. But eight qubits is enough for a quantum computer to represent every number between 0 and 255 at the same…</span>

What started as a birthday party in Huntington Beach, California, quickly descended into chaos over the weekend. 


A TikTok video promoting a birthday party went viral, and thousands of people showed up on the beach and in the streets Saturday night. Riot police were called as the unruly crowd launched fireworks and threw rocks and bottles. An emergency curfew was implemented through early Sunday with 150 arrests. 







A TikTok post (now taken down) called Adrian&#x27;s Kickback by user &quot;adrian.lopez517&quot; swelled to more than 2,500 people on Saturday night. In the days before the meetup, the post went absolutely viral, gaining more than 200 million views on the app.

&quot;In real terms, home prices have never been so high. My data goes back over 100 years, so this is something,&quot; Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller told CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Trading Nation.&quot; 


Shiller is the co-founder of the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price index. He is worried about a housing bubble forming where the &quot;Wild West&quot; mentality pushes prices higher. He also is concerned about stocks and cryptocurrencies.







 &quot;I don&#x27;t think that the whole thing is explained by central bank policy. There is something about the sociology of markets that are happening,&quot; he said. 


Shiller has noticed that housing starts drive home prices. But last week, despite a shortage of homes and buildable prope…</span>

The news business just can’t stop clowning itself. The latest indignity is an international fact-checking debacle originating, of all places, at a “festival of fact-checking.”

The Poynter Institute is perhaps the most respected think tank in our business, an organization seeking to “fortify journalism’s role in a free society,” among other things through its sponsorship of the fact-checking outlet PolitiFact. A few weeks back, it held a virtual convention called the “United Facts of America: A Festival of Fact-Checking.”

There was a ton of hype last week when Ford Motor Company unveiled its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck. As of Friday, Ford secured more than 44,000 reservations for the new truck. 


Ford&#x27;s first all-electric truck is expected to have a targeted range between 230 and 300 miles depending on the version the customer chooses. Ford said the truck could haul up to 10,000 pounds. 







Auto blog Jalopnik points out that Ford failed to release data on how hauling or towing would affect range last week. 


In an emailed response, Vice News had a similar question and asked a Ford spokeswoman.

Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,


Despite relentless positive promotion by the media and political elites, support for Black Lives Matter in America has dropped to a two year low.







An essay written by academics Jennifer Chudy and Hakeem Jefferson published by the New York Times analyzes how support for BLM soared to +20% in mid-2020 but rapidly dropped to only +5% – which is where it was in mid-2019.


The authors note that the figures serve to contradict “the idea that the country underwent a racial reckoning.”

                    <span>&quot;The Fed Has Lost Control&quot; - John Williams Warns Of Hyperinflation In 2022

            
Via Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com,


Economist John Williams, founder of ShadowStats.com, says the Federal Reserve has painted itself into such a tight corner with the economy it really has only two choices.  Williams says it comes down to “Inflation or Implosion.”







What would happen to the financial system if the Fed stopped printing massive amounts of money for stimulus and debt service?  Williams explains,



“You could see financial implosion by preventing liquidity being put into the system.  The system needs liquidity (freshly created dollars) to function. Without that liquidity, you would see more of an economic implosion than you have already seen.  In fact, I will contend that…</span>

President Biden, a self-described &#x27;devout Catholic,&#x27; will become the first US official in two decades not to attend Notre Dame&#x27;s commencement ceremony, citing a &#x27;scheduling conflict&#x27; according to the Catholic News Agency.







The news comes after 4,600 &quot;members of the Notre Dame community&quot; signed a petition urging college president Fr. John Jenkins not to invite Biden - the second Roman Catholic president, over his stance on abortion, according to Fox News. Of note, Biden was told in February by US Archbishop Joseph Naumann to stop calling himself a &#x27;devout catholic&#x27; over his pro-abortion views.

Authored by Michael Klare via TomDispatch.com,


Thanks to its very name - renewable energy - we can picture a time in the not-too-distant future when our need for non-renewable fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal will vanish. Indeed, the Biden administration has announced a breakthrough target of 2035 for fully eliminating U.S. reliance on those non-renewable fuels for the generation of electricity. That would be accomplished by “deploying carbon-pollution-free electricity-generating resources,” primarily the everlasting power of the wind and sun.


With other nations moving in a similar direction, it’s tempting to conclude that the days when competition over finite supplies of energy was a recurring so…</span>

There&#x27;s a lot of noise from the Biden administration, who claim to be addressing gun violence as an epidemic, but their efforts have only been for optics, as very little action has been taken so far. This past weekend, a dozen mass shootings were recorded across the country, according to CNN. 


Nonprofit research group Gun Violence Archive (GVA) reported that at least 12 mass shootings were observed in eight states, including Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia, Texas, and Minnesota.



This is the second straight year that the month of May has had 60+ mass shootings. https://t.co/xUBTCOf9xW

Left-wing website website Vox has been caught stealth editing an old article from March 2020 “debunking” the lab origin of COVID following numerous prominent officials now saying the lab origin is a distinct possibility.

Below is my column in The Hill on the recent decision of a federal judge that the Biden Administration was engaged in racial and gender discrimination in the administration of the pandemic relief under the American Rescue Plan Act. It is a question that is now being raised in a variety of federal programs under the Biden Administration.

                    <span>Ron Paul: Fed Inflation Is Propping Up Big Government Spending

            
Via SchiffGold.com,


Inflation came in hot in April. Initially gold sold off on the news. But over the following week, there appears to have been something of a pivot in the market. Gold and the dollar both started behaving as one would expect in an inflationary environment. Peter Schiff said it looks like investors are starting to worry the Fed won’t fight inflation after all.







The markets have been by and large operating on the assumption that the Fed would stick to its playbook and tighten monetary policy to deal with increasing consumer prices. But Peter has been saying there is no way the Fed could fight inflation if it wants to. Inflation is propping up the economy. If the Fed raised rates and…</span>

The White House on Monday deflected after Fox News&#x27; Peter Doocy put spox Jen Psaki on the spot following a Wall Street Journal report that three workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell ill with COVID-19 symptoms in December of 2019, bolstering the lab-leak theory for the origins of the pandemic.







&quot;Why isn&#x27;t President Biden pushing for more access, more information to get to the bottom of exactly what happened,&quot; asked Doocy.


&quot;We are,&quot; replied Psaki, adding &quot;and we have repeatedly called for the WHO to support an expert-driven evaluation of the origins. During that first phase of the investigation there was not access to data, there was not information provided. And now we&#x27;re hopeful that WH…</span>

Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,


The Biden Administration is discussing hiking corporate taxes to pay for the proposed infrastructure spending package. While the goal is to ensure the “rich pay their fair share,” a look at history suggests changing tax rates will have very little impact on economic outcomes.


Leading up to, and following, the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Trump Tax Cuts) I wrote a lot of analysis on:




	
The fallacy of tax cuts,

	

	

	
Why tax cuts wouldn’t change corporate behavior; and,

	

	

	
How tax cuts are an ineffective method of improving economic prosperity.

	


What we know now, is that our analysis was correct. As noted, corporate behavi…</span>

                    <span>New York City Is Back: At Least 30 People Shot Over The Weekend

            
New York City is officially back: almost 30 people were shot in New York City this past weekend - and that number was only up until about 2PM on Sunday. 


29 victims in total had been struck by gunfire by early evening Sunday, according to the New York Post, with one reported fatality. 


“These kids are having running gun battles and innocents are getting shot,” one veteran NYPD officer told the Post. “Nobody is interested in hearing how many shots are fired but if people knew how many shootings occurred where there are no victims — it’s by the grace of God.&quot;


Among those struck by gunfire over the weekend were a Manhattan federal prosecutor, Mollie Bracewell, who was dining outside in Brooklyn’s Prospect Heights, and Benjamin Bustamante, an innocent bystander walking nearby. 







The weekend hadn&#x27;t even ended before one officer said &quot;there were just two more right now&quot;, referring to additional shootings late Sunday. 


Shootings took place at Beach 30th Street and Seagirt Boulevard in Far Rockaway, Queens, among other locations throughout the city.


Two people were shot in that area after a &quot;gang dispute&quot; spilled out of a nearby park, the report says. 


And if &quot;diversity&quot; in your violent crimes is a major concern, as we know it probably is for Mayor De Blasio, it should be noted that in addition to the shootings, there was a fatal stabbing in Northern Brooklyn and a man who was beaten to death in the Northeast Bronx over the weekend as well.

                    <span>Inflation: 1970s, 1980s, And Today

            
Submitted by Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research


The inflation of the 1970s/early 1980s is a big topic just now, but a deep dive into the historical CPI data shows the world was very different then. The CPI peak in 1974 felt awful because food/clothing was 33 pct of the index and prices were up 8-12 pct. Those items are just 14 pct of CPI now. May 1980’s 13-14 pct CPI inflation was driven by high mortgage rates, no longer even used in CPI. Bottom line: look forward, not backwards, and consider energy stocks, gold, “B”, and even US stocks as inflation hedges.


&quot;You don’t know how to think about inflation unless you lived through the 1970s.&quot; We see that comment a lot these days and can’t help but smile. I (Nick) do vividly remember in…</span>

We were off, but not by too much: on Monday, the Fed revealed that the amount of overnight reserves parked at the Fed rose by another $26BN to $394.9BN (with 54 counteparties) from $369BN (52 counteparties) on Friday, which was the 5th highest in history, up a whopping $186 billion in one week and the highest non-quarter end reverse repo usage ever!

Back in December, vol-specialist hedge fund One River Asset Management surprised its peers when long before Elon Musk arrived on  the scene, it became one of the first major asset managers to disclose it had purchased $600 million in bitcoin and ethereum and said it would own more than $1 billion in cryptos in early 2021. It wasn&#x27;t along in this pioneering effort: Brevan Howard Asset Management co-founder Alan Howard had taken an ownership stake in One River Digital and was helping provide the company with backend trading services. Another prominent backer was British hedge fund Ruffer, which last December also revealed that 2.5% of its total AUM were in bitcoin.

With so much focus on the macro environment as stocks struggle to return to their all-time highs, MacroVoices invited seasoned Wall Street economist David Rosenberg, the chief economist and chief strategist of Rosenberg Research, on the show this week to discus the market&#x27;s topic du jour: inflation, and whether or not it will be &quot;transitory,&quot; like the Federal Reserve says.


What followed was a thorough critique from Rosenberg, who just a couple of months ago was warning that rising Treasury yields would soon push the market to a &quot;breaking point,&quot; of what he sees as flaws in the market&#x27;s pricing of lasting inflationary pressures.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced this weekend that he will not get vaccinated against COVID-19, explaining that he already contracted the virus last year and has “natural immunity.”







Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, said that he has not seen evidence proving the vaccine is more effective than having survived the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, otherwise known as the novel coronavirus, so he won’t get the shot.



“Until they show me evidence that people who have already had the infection are dying in large numbers, or being hospitalized or getting very sick, I just made my own personal decision that I’m not getting vaccinated because I’ve al…</span>

Confirming that &quot;selling in May&quot; is there for a reason, virtually every bank has turned cautious if not outright downbeat on the market following a blockbuster earnings season when despite record earnings beats, the S&amp;P is down compared to where it was a month ago. So now that Wall Street is back to its favorite activity of &quot;explaining&quot; events after the fact, here is Goldman strategist Chris Hussey listing the three key &quot;grey rhino&quot; events the market is grappling with.


As Hussey writes in the &quot;end of week&quot; market intel note, &quot;gray rhino&quot; risks have proliferated around markets this week, helping to sustain the tepid return range that the S&amp;P 500 has been stuck in all of May (now down 0.2% mtd). Incidentally, for t…</span>

The world’s worst disaster in a century killed 7.1mm-12.7mm across the planet. The total continued rising. No one knew exactly when it would end, only that the poorest nations would bear the brunt. They always do. European and Asian countries lost more citizens than they had since WWII. The US lost more than in any war. Children fell behind. Economic costs spiraled, leaving each nation’s finances forever changed. Monetary and fiscal policy merged in the West. Inflation reappeared. Despots tightened their grip. America’s president was voted out.

                    <span>&quot;Air&#x27;s Coming Out Of The Balloon&quot; - Redfin CEO Says Home Price Gains Set To Cool

            
Glenn Kelman, CEO at Redfin, spoke with Bloomberg Radio&#x27;s Denise Pellegrini on Wednesday about the state of the US housing market. He said the latest surge in home prices could subside. 


Kelman said the housing market is a frenzy, with most houses selling above the asking prices, which has never happened before. 


After record gains in the first quarter, some home prices are likely to stall. 


Nationwide, the median existing-home sales price rose 16.2% in the first quarter to $319,200, a record high in data going back to 1989, according to the National Association of Realtors.

                    <span>Apples-to-Apples, Consumer Price Inflation Is Nearing 1970-Type Numbers

            
By Joseph Carson, former chief economist at Alliance Bernstein


Apples-to-apples, consumer price inflation nowadays is running close to the high inflation readings of the late 1970s. That should be a red flag for policymakers as monetary decisions are focused on actual outcomes, not forecasted. But reported inflation statistics do not show the 1970s inflation-style inflation because they no longer include actual house prices.


The old consumer price index included house prices in measuring the owner&#x27;s housing cost, whereas the present-day price index base owners&#x27; housing cost on an arbitrary, non-market rent measure. The only way to make a price series strictly comparable over time is to use the s…</span>

Three researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were so sick in November of 2019 that they sought hospitalization, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing a previously undisclosed US intelligence report &quot;that could add weight to growing calls for a fuller probe of whether the COVID-19 virus may have escaped from the laboratory.&quot;

All Gas, No Brakes


The weather in London this week has been rainy while sunny, which feels like a fair description of current sentiment, as we’ve been discussing our mid-year outlook with investors this week. There’s a wide range of views out there at the moment, with the noisiness of the data giving everyone something to hang their hat on. In short, it’s the perfect time to step back and debate the longer-term outlook.


The most notable aspect of our forecasts, and one of the most contentious areas of debate, is just how much our expectations differ from the prior decade. The post-GFC period was defined by fiscal aust…</span>

                    <span>Fauci Finally Admits COVID-19 May Have Come From Wuhan Lab, &#x27;Not Convinced&#x27; Of Natural Origin

            
Earlier this month, just hours after Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) dragged Anthony Fauci over pandemic misinformation - and the fact that Fauci&#x27;s NIH funded risky collaborations at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - the nation&#x27;s top virologist (and highest-paid government employee) furiously backpedaled over the origins of the pandemic in what we can only assume was an effort to redirect attention from his own culpability.







Recall that since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, Fauci parroted CCP talking points - insisting that the virus couldn&#x27;t possibly have come from a Chinese lab.

                    <span>Basel III &amp; The New Role For Gold

            
Authored by Tom Luongo via Gold, Goats, &#x27;n Guns blog,


Last week both Martin Armstrong and Alistair MacLeod wrote about the changes to the Basel III rules and how they will greatly affect the physical and paper gold markets if implemented in their current form.


MacLeod’s article from last week is an excellent primer on the definitions and inner workings of the rules, the gold market and the changes to the rules.  The short redux is that the advantage to using unallocated accounts, savings accounts which are linked to gold by holding futures contracts, will end.


We’ve discussed parts of this in the past.  The process of creating fake supply to control the price of gold is on the line with these rule changes.

A prominent crypto analytics firm has issued a new report suggesting the Islamic Republic was able to successfully weather the Trump-era sanctions storm of the past few years by generating up to a billion dollars a year through mining cryptocurrencies. 


Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic concluded that a whopping 4.5% of all global bitcoin mining takes place in Iran alone. The Iranian government itself has acknowledged these attempts to beat the near total economic embargo on the country, which has been in effect and progressively ramped up since Trump pulled out of the Obama-era JCPOA nuclear deal in May 2018.

Submitted by Bruce Wilds of Advancing Time,


The cost of living numbers prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are highly misleading. Currently, the government understates inflation by using a formula based on the concept of a “constant level of satisfaction” that evolved during the first half of the 20th century in academia. This extended into the BLS re-weightings sales outlets such as discount or mass merchandisers with Main Street shops. Those promoting this change claimed it was simply another way to measure inflation and it still reflected the true cost of living.  







The fact is, politicians and those behind this system created it as a way to reduce the cost of living adjustments for governme…</span>

It appears that Iran may be applying some last-minute leverage just ahead of the final round of nuclear talks in Vienna, and at a moment it&#x27;s being widely reported that the main parties, including the US, are on the cusp of agreeing on a deal as final documents are being drafted. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Sunday announced that IAEA inspectors will no longer have access to surveillance images of the country&#x27;s nuclear sites. 


&quot;From May 22 and with the end of the three-month agreement, the agency will have no access to data collected by cameras inside the nuclear facilities agreed under the agreement,&quot; Qalibaf said as announced in state television.

“The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in ‘Metcalfe’s law’ becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine,”

“Bitcoin isn’t a new innovation; it’s been around since 2009, and in all that time nobody seems to have found any good legal use for it. It’s not a convenient medium of exchange; it’s not a stable store of value; it’s definitely not a unit of account”

Back in 2019, we published a post in The Institutional Risk Analyst called “Nationalizing the Federal Funds Market,” that talked about the increasingly overt actions of the Federal Open Market Committee in the market for short-term funding.


Then as now, we view the actions of the FOMC as slowly destroying the private money markets in the US and preparing to very visibly push the big banks out of the transmission chain of monetary policy.

Last week, when cryptos again plunged on the well-timed recurring &quot;news&quot; report that China was again banning crypto - something China has been doing with zero success since 2014 but has taken on new urgency now that its Digital Yuan has emerged as a total flop - this time in the format of cracking down in Proof-of-Work (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0) crypto miners, we said that this could be the best thing to happen for crypto: after all, the China was and is the bitcoin bears biggest friend: as long as bitcoin is mostly mined in China, where coal power plants account for most of electrical generation, bitcoin will remain &quot;dirty&quot; and give the ESG fanatics ammo to criticize bitcoin.

Authored by Cara Ding via The Epoch Times,


Chicago’s largest police union on Wednesday issued a vote of no confidence against Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown.







The vote came during a Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) meeting where police officers vented their frustrations, new and old, with the mayor and and the police department, Chicago FOP president John Catanzara told The Epoch Times.


Emotions were running high, Catanzara said, and one member grabbed the microphone to suggest a vote of no confidence. All members present at the meeting, about 150 active and retired police officers, voted for it.

A bizarre and alarming incident which officials are calling unprecedented unfolded over the skies of Eastern Europe on Sunday. A Ryanair flight which had departed Athens and was en route to Vilnius - the capital of Lithuania - was forced to land in Belarus to allow state intelligence and security services to detain a journalist who&#x27;s long been critical of President Alexander Lukashenko.


Bloomberg has identified the detained journalist is Raman Pratasevich, described as &quot;the former editor-in-chief of the most popular Telegram news channel in Belarus&quot; who was &quot;arrested in the Minsk airport after the plane landed, according to the Minsk-based human rights center Viasna, which…</span>

                    <span>Crypto Continues Crashing - 5 Lessons From Bitcoin&#x27;s Very Bad Week

            
It&#x27;s never just one thing. This week Elon Musk, China, and pipeline cyber attackers all contributed to another crash, but, as Decrypt&#x27;s Jeff John Roberts details below, there&#x27;s cause for optimism.


It began with Elon Musk bashing Bitcoin, and ended with a renewed crypto crackdown in China. Those came as book-ends to a spate of other bad news in cryptoland, including a stomach-churning market crash and anger over Bitcoin&#x27;s role in facilitating a massive cyber attack on an east coast oil pipeline. All of this saw Bitcoin limp into the weekend well below the $40,000 mark as the entire crypto industry licked its wounds.


And this weekend has seen the losses accelerate further with Bitcoin back below $34k..…</span>

Transitory or not transitory, that is the question.


The challenges from cracking supply-chains and the resulting strain on production and inventory are being felt widely. If you are looking to furnish a home, you have probably dealt with major delays in the delivery of your new sofa and may instead be sitting on beanbags. If you are looking to buy a car, you might be walking out with the sticker price and the wrong color. And good luck if you are trying to rent a car: if only Hertz had waited a year to file for bankruptcy it would be worth tens of billions today.

Market Review &amp; Update


After another rough start to the week, the bulls finally showed up and flipped our “money flow” indicators back to a buy signal. As we stated last week:



“Well, that follow-through failed to occur.Not only did the “buy signal” not trigger, but the market also broke down through the previous consolidation range. As I said, it did not work out as planned. The last exposure we took on is now pressuring the portfolio momentarily, but we should benefit from the turn if we are correct.”



With markets deeply oversold on a short-term basis and with signals at levels that generally precede short-term rallies, the rally on Thursday and Friday …</span>

New policies will artificially deflate “breakthrough infections” in the vaccinated, while the old rules continue to inflate case numbers in the unvaccinated.







The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) is altering its practices of data logging and testing for “Covid19” in order to make it seem the experimental gene-therapy “vaccines” are effective at preventing the alleged disease.


They made no secret of this, announcing the policy changes on their website in late April/early May, (though naturally without admitting the fairly obvious motivation behind the change).

Three Markets topics to discuss today:


Issue #1: What are US markets trying to tell us? It would be tempting to say “Nothing” … That we’re only 3 percent off the S&amp;P 500’s record close of 4,233, set all of 8 trading days ago. That there’s plenty of good news to come. That Europe is just now reopening … All these are true, but they are also broadly known and therefore already in asset prices.

Some of the world&#x27;s rarest cacti are found in the deserts of South America. A recent raid in Italy uncovered a smuggling network of thorny succulents, according to NYTimes. 


The year&#x27;s long operation, dubbed &quot;Operation Atacama,&quot; was a collaborative effort that began in February 2020 by Italian and Chilean authorities to return some of the rarest cacti to Chile.

The Center for Disease Control’s major easing of its mask-use recommendations was a welcome development, giving Americans hope that logic can triumph over the CDC’s bureaucratic inertia and its Covid-era tendency to push the most severe restrictions on human activity at every turn.

Authored by Robert Murphy via The Mises Institute,


With the possible exception of international trade, no topic in economics contains more myths than monetary theory. 







In the present article I address four popular opinions concerning money that suffer from either ambiguity or outright falsehood.


One: &quot;Money represents a claim on goods and services.&quot;

Around 10:40 a.m. Saturday Beijing time, China&#x27;s first Mars rover officially drove down its landing platform ramp and began roaming the Red Planet, China National Space Administration (CNSA) said. 


CNSA release another photograph (here&#x27;s the first) of the rover, called Zhurong, which touched down in the southern part of Utopia Planitia, a large plain on the northern hemisphere of Mars, last Saturday.

As a recent study from the IEA showed, achieving the emissions goals laid out in the Paris Accords would require oil and gas companies to halt all new projects. Among other things, the report included a daunting timeline of milestones that must be met to achieve net zero by 2050.

As President Joe Biden considers forgiving $10,000 in student debt per borrower and ending tuition for many students at public colleges, it is worth noting that college graduates already have not paid $435 billion back to the federal government.


That’s right, of the government’s $1.4 trillion student loan portfolio, almost one-third is unpaid.

At the same time we take one step forward from government overreach and Covid panic, with the CDC finally ending its mask mandate, it feels like we&#x27;re taking two steps back, as the desperation to get literally every single person on Earth vaccinated still feels more and more palpable - even as the nation nears 50% of its population having at least one dose of the vaccine already.

                    <span>Elon Musk Declares Support For Crypto Over Fiat Currencies

            
There&#x27;s no doubt that Elon Musk is currently at the center of the Bitcoin universe.


It was Musk&#x27;s public critiquing of Bitcoin mining&#x27;s environmental impact that started a chain of events that led to Bitcoin crashing last week, before eventually steadying and paring some of its losses.


That means, for better or for worse, almost all eyes on the crypto community are on Musk. This weekend, they&#x27;ll likely be happier with what th…</span>

The French version of Michael Lewis’ book The Big Short is intitled Le casse du siècle, which literally means the “heist of the century.” This idea is interesting, as going short can be regarded as finding the weak points of the financial system and hacking into it.


However, that game is not easy.

Fourteen year old Gao Yuan was attending a boarding school in China when the Cultural Revolution broke out in 1966. And that’s when his life changed forever.


Even though the communists had won the Chinese Civil War and been in total power since 1945, Chairman Mao still believed that there was too much capitalist influence in China.

A new book called &quot;Battle for the Soul: Inside the Democrats’ Campaigns to Defeat Donald Trump&quot; by Edward-Isaac Dovere, a staff writer at the Atlantic, offers an inside look at what Barack Obama really thought about Donald Trump heading into the 2020 election.

Yesterday, when bitcoin was crashing, ARK Invest&#x27;s Cathie Wood sparked some laughter (especially among the crypto bears) when in her interview with Bloomberg TV she presented her bitcoin price target: $500,000.





While this was in keeping with Wood&#x27;s traditionally hyperbolic forecasts (like Tesla to $3,000 for example), one could make the argument that at least in 2020, the market did give Wood…</span>

Authored by J. Peder Zane via RealClearPolitics.com,


The Biden administration is vigorously pursuing key figures from the phony Trump/Russia collusion scandal that roiled the nation for four years. But instead of trying to punish the liars who perpetrated that fraud, it is targeting the truth-tellers who challenged and exposed the conspiracy to negate the 2016 election.

Republican governors in nearly half of US states have all announced plans to scrap beefed-up federal unemployment benefits they say have disincentivized workers to reenter the workforce.







The shift away from the $300-per-week handout started earlier this month with Montana and South Carolina ending the boost. This week, Indiana, Oklahoma and Texas joined the fray to bring the total number of states to …</span>

A couple of months ago, we heard the first reports about Robinhood, SoFi and potentially other rival brokerages developing platforms to allow retail traders something that has, until now, been off-limits to mom and pop investors: access to IPO allocations of newly public companies.

The lockdowns implemented to curb the transmission of COVID-19 in the United States and across the globe have not only been a “heinous abuse of power,” but they have also failed to protect the elderly and vulnerable, according to former White House COVID-19 adviser Dr. Scott Atlas.

There&#x27;s no question that the SPAC frenzy has slowed substantially from its frenzied peak late last year, but even as the pace of dealmaking has slowed (giving weary junior investment-banking analysts a rest), there&#x27;s little question that the SPAC trend has changed the nature of dealmaking, especially for Private Equity firms, as Institutional Investor pointed out.

As expected, today&#x27;s overnight reverse repo facility usage soared above $300 billion, surging $57BN from $293BN on Wednesday to a whopping $351BN as 48 counterparties parked their reserves with the Fed in exchange for a 0.000% rate.

                    <span>Nearly 20% Of Seattle Cops Quit Amid National Protests, Budget Cuts

            
Just under 20% of Seattle police have quit the force over the past year and a half, according to CBS News, citing the city&#x27;s interim Chief of Police.







The revelation comes after more than a year of violent clashes with anti-police protesters from BLM and Antifa, and a city council which has neutered the Seattle PD&#x27;s ability to use crowd control devices that social justice activists say didn&#x27;t go far enough.

A Johns Hopkins University medical professor said that closed schools are an “American disgrace.”







Dr. Marty Makary — a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s prestigious School of Medicine and a Fox News contributor — said during an interview with “Coffee With Closers” ripped public health officials’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

BlockFi Inc., a crypto-lending startup, mistakenly sent some users millions of dollars in Bitcoin as part of a promotion and is now rapidly working on reversing it.







Just under 100 BlockFi users are reported to be affected, with some allegedly receiving as many as 700 Bitcoin due to the mishandled promotional offer.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told Fox News the amount of fentanyl seized at the southwest border could kill everyone in New York. 







Abbott said US border agents intercepted a mindboggling 800% increase in fentanyl shipments in April versus the same time last year.

There is an extraordinary column in the Washington Post from Glenn Kessler on a key figures in past coverage on the removal of Confederate statues. The Post ran a widely cited article on how Robert E. Lee’s own descendant wanted the general’s statues to be removed.

When it comes to living in the US, New Jersey isn&#x27;t seen as the worst state of the bunch... but it&#x27;s close: according to a recent YouGov poll, the Garden State ranks 3rd from the bottom, only above Alabama and Mississippi (DC is not yet a state, but the Biden admin is doing everything in its power to change that).

A National Pulse review of White House Visitors Logs from November 2014 reveals a meeting in the White House Situation Room, chaired by then-Ebola Czar Ron Klain. The meeting appears to have been coordinated by Dr. Anthony Fauci, and included several high-level U.S. government agency heads.

The US cash open sparked a buying panic in stocks (after Nasdaq had given up all its overnight gains accelerating lower after the dismal housing data) and then again as 1430ET (margin call time) loomed, the broad market took a big hit. The ubiquitous dip was bought (back up to unch for Nasdaq and Small Caps) but then with about 10 mins to the close, everything fell apart...

                    <span>EV Anxiety? World&#x27;s Largest Lithium Producer Crashes On Chilean Political Storm

            
As we detailed earlier, as Chileans overwhelmingly chose leftist and independent candidates for the country&#x27;s constitutional convention, the new non-free-market-friendly political regime is generating a lot of uncertainly in Chilean markets.


One of the biggest equity losers on the session is Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile SA (SQM), the world&#x27;s largest producer of lithium, down more than 10% in the US cash…</span>

Late last week, amid a Slack-driven furor over his confessional memoir Chaos Monkeys, Apple fired ads engineer Antonio Garcia-Martinez. I wrote Friday about the specific hypocrisy of Apple’s move — the company has the author of Bitches Ain’t Shit on its board but claimed it fired Garcia-Martinez as a statement of its devotion to “inclusivity” — but over the wee…</span>

The problem with the North American lumber industry is that supply is controlled by just a few firms that can easily manipulate prices. For instance, WSJ reports lumber mills are in no rush to bring on additional capacity as they reap the rewards of consumers paying four times the average price.

NASA designated the sunspots as AR2822 and AR2823 and are Earth-facing.
