America's billionaire class is now the second most "bloated" in the world after...Sweden?


If that sounds strange, it's just one example of how the global explosion in wealth is impacting the world in unexpected ways.

Authored by Pat Buchanan,


On taking the oath of office, Jan. 20, Joe Biden may not have realized it, but history had dealt him a pair of aces.


The COVID-19 pandemic had reached its apex, infecting a quarter of a million Americans every day. Yet, due to the discovery and distribution of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the incidence of infections had crested and was about to turn sharply down.


By May, the infection rate had fallen…</span>

In the wake of Friday's underwhelming jobs number, the media has been hungry for stories about people quitting prestigious jobs - like the Goldman MD who reportedly quit after making a fortune off dogecoin.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday said it is responsible for colleges to teach the idea that racism is embedded in the American system, dismissing criticism that such teaching aims at indoctrinating American youth.

Besides the ups and downs daily, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite has been on a tear for the last five years. But since commodities began to outperform earlier this year, Nasdaq year-to-date gains are flat.

Authored by Cal Thomas. op-ed via The Epoch Times,


Thanks to the beneficence of the Internal Revenue Service—and the fallout from COVID-19—we half of Americans who pay federal income taxes have been given until May 17 to file.







Since I began earning enough to file Form 1040 and associated forms, I have only known one person who prepared his own taxes. That was Bill Archer, a Texas Republican who formerly headed the House Ways and Means Committee. I …</span>

"The choice is yours."



The rule is now simple: get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do.

After several impressive quarters of huge gains for its recently launched Disney+ subscription service, Disney couldn't quite make it this time and moments ago the company reported Q1 earnings that beat on the bottom line but missed on revenues and subscribers, sending the stock sliding in after hours.


Here are the details: first the good news:

And now the bad:

It was an erratic day, which in so many ways was a mirror image of yesterday, and even though today's blistering PPI print confirmed yesterday's near-record CPI number, traders who expected a continuation of yesterday's action were left nursing big losses.


Perhaps it was the fervent defense of the "transitory inflation" narrative on Wall Street, but whatever the reason, yesterday's surge in the VIX reversed…</span>

Bank of America's economists have been on a roll in the past three months.


Back in February, the bank looked at its credit and debit card spending data and concluded that consensus was far, far too low, predicting that the stimmy-fueled January retail sales print would be above 4.1%.







Not only was BofA's outlier forecast right, but the headline retail sales number came in even higher: at a whopping 5.3%, nearly 5x higher than the consensus …</span>

Senator Rand Paul continued to slam White House medical advisor Thursday, saying that Anthony Fauci could be culpable for the entire coronavirus pandemic.







Paul was attacked by leftist media Wednesday for merely questioning Fauci’s extensive role in granting funding to the Wuhan Institute of Virology at a Senate hearing.

Economist Judy Shelton had a crackerjack column in last week's Wall Street Journal on the lack of intellectual and policy diversity at the Federal Reserve. She points out that during the entire term of Chairman Jerome Powell and his predecessor, Janet Yellen, not a single dissenting vote was recorded among the governors.

A tiger that was seen roaming loose in a Houston area neighborhood over the weekend has yet to be located - but its owner has been identified and arrested.


The exotic animal reportedly belongs to a man named Victor Cuevas, who was out of jail on bond on an "unrelated murder charge", according to local ABC affiliates. "Cuevas is accused of shooting and killing a man in July 2017 and is out on a $125,0…</span>

Judge Harlin Hale tossed the case after New York Attorney General Letitia James and others questioned how legitimate the January 15th bankruptcy filing was, according to a report by Law 360.

The phenomenon of "cancel culture" is a toxic one metastasizing into a woke revolution war empowered by Big Tech and Big Business. Those unfamiliar with being canceled involve publicly shaming others and boycotting celebrities and companies. However, the art of canceling has progressed well beyond canceling public figures and is now used to garget average folks. The result can be devastating for ordinary people who may f…</span>

With Trump out of office and Biden now taking credit for all pandemic-related progress, several new studies - some of them picked up by MSM outlets, have significantly dialed back the fear (asymptomatic spread is less common than previously thought, surfaces are actually pretty safe, etc.).


Now, the New York Times of all outlets is calling out the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for a bullshit claim that "less than 10 percent" of COVID…</span>

Being contrarian is hard work. You need to withstand ridicule, the loss of friends, employment, and acquaintances, face the imminent possibility that most of the time you’ll be wrong, and abandon the warm fuzzy feeling of having your otherwise friendly peers confirming your bias.

Amid all the chaos in equity markets, oil managed to bounce back to modest gains on the day with WTI as a weaker dollar offset some concerns of a growing pile up of crude in the U.S. Gulf Coast as refineries there cut runs in response to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown.



Traders are expecting “a gradual resolution to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown,” according to Louise Dickson, an analyst at consultant Rystad Energy.

After yesterday's ugliness in big-tech and small-caps, many hoped for a bounce today. But the combination of ARKK gamma and CTA deleveraging meant the pain was not over and both Nasdaq and Russell 2000 plunged into the cash market open (after getting hit as the Asia open and European open)...

Does the biggest downside miss in history for employment mean higher inflation? That’s the debate raging through markets and indeed DB research.


I lean towards the inflation side. Remember the Chart of the Day on Thursday showing small business “jobs hard to fill” was at record levels last month - a good guide with hindsight to the payroll number issues. (as of this morning, this…</span>

Authored by Janita Kan via The Epoch Times,


A bipartisan coalition of attorneys general is urging Facebook to abandon its plans to create a platform for children under the age of 13.







The attorneys general sent a letter to Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg arguing that the use of social media can be detrimental to children and that the company had previously failed to protect the welfare of children on its platforms.

Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,


House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he has officially scheduled a vote for Wednesday to oust House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) from her post, soon after he endorsed Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) for the No. 3 leadership spot.

The sexual harassment investigation against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) has widened in scope, as the state AG's office has begun looking into whether a top Cuomo adviser linked access to COVID-19 vaccines with political support for the governor, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.

A rare direct 'live fire' encounter took place Monday in the Strait of Hormuz between Iranian fast-attack boats and US naval warships. The Iranian vessels came dangerously close to multiple US ships during the incident in the vital waterway off Iran's coast.


The IRGC fast boats departed only after some 30 warning shots were fired by a US Coast Guard vessel that had been escorting the naval group, which included up …</span>

Almost a decade ago, we explained that America had become a bizarre kind of welfare state where, due to the premeditated vagaries of the tax code, hard work was punished.


As a reminder, back in 2012 we showed that it was increasingly lucrative - in the form of actual disposable income - to do the bare minimum, receive minimum wage and collect various welfare entitlements, than to work hard and aspire to …</span>
